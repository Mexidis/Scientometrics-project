Title = {Palaeoenvironmental inferences of a Mexican Konservat-Lagerstatte
   (Tlayua Quarry; Lower Cretaceous) based on the geochemistry of rare
   earth elements},
Journal = {CRETACEOUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {167},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Tlayua Quarry is considered one of the most important Cretaceous
   outcrops in Mexico. Its well-preserved palaeobiota has allowed this
   outcrop to be considered a Konservat-Lagerst \& auml;tte. Geochemical
   proxies such as major, minor and trace elements were evaluated from
   selected Zones of the Tlay \& uacute;a Quarry, in order to infer some
   features of the depositional environment in which Tlay \& uacute;a
   limestones originated. Aluminum, Thorium and Zirconium concentrations in
   addition to a low Phosphorous content evidence little terrigenous
   contamination, as well as a phosphate-free environment. Additionally,
   proxies such as Fe vs Sigma REE, Mn vs Sigma REE, Al vs Sigma REE, Fe vs
   Nd-SN/Yb-SN, Al vs Nd-SN/Yb-SN, and Ce/Ce \& lowast; vs Eu/Eu \& lowast;
   show low correlation values (r(2) less than 0.25 in all cases with n =
   128 and p < 0.05), thus suggesting a negligible influence of diagenetic
   effects or terrigenous contamination. These conditions are necessary for
   carrying out reliable palaeoenvironmental interpretations. Rare Earth
   Elements + Yttrium (REE+Y) concentrations were normalised to the
   Post-Archean Australian Shale standard to evaluate REE+Y patterns and
   anomalies. Following traits were identified: a slightly enrichment of
   heavy REE relative to light REE and moderate REE; positive La/La-SN,
   Gd/Gd-SN and Y/Y-SN anomalies; negative/positive Ce/Ce-SN anomalies;
   superchondritic and chondritic Y/Ho ratios. Here, we described that most
   of our limestone samples show the influence of marine waters and well
   oxidising conditions. However, freshwater signals that have been
   reported for some regions of the Tlayua Quarry were also verified.
   Geochemical data are in agreement with the depositional environment
   evidenced by microfacies. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights are

Abstract = {In this article, we introduce and examine the efficiency of a portfolio
   diversification measure. Using the recently developed coherence
   properties for diversification measures as well as other criteria, we
   show that the novel measure outperforms the most commonly used
   diversification measures. Although similar in shape to other measures,
   our measure is the only one that satisfies all nine coherence properties
   whilst being easily interpreted. After testing interpretability and
   coherence for all measures, we perform an empirical analysis divided
   into two main parts. In the first part, we test some common
   diversification measures in a Gaussian context and in the second part we
   consider three empirical portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
   establish the efficiency of our measure in capturing the changing level
   of diversification in empirical portfolios. We believe these results
   imply a competitive advantage for our measure and make it relevant for
   econometricians, practitioners and decision-makers in general in a
   portfolio optimisation context.},

Title = {Study of the first step of hydrogen release in ammonia borane using

Abstract = {Ammonia borane, as a source of hydrogen, has attracted much attention
   due to its high hydrogen content, low molecular weight, and high
   stability in solution. However, the process and enhancement of hydrogen
   release must be done practically under ambient conditions. For this
   work, Raman spectroscopy, principal component analysis (PCA), and
   molecular simulation were applied to study the hydrogen release process
   of ammonia borane. Three stages of release were observed from room
   temperature to 1300 ?. The shift, the appearance, and the disappearance
   of the Raman bands were evident in the whole process. In-situ monitoring
   of Raman and PCA, with four different heating rates between 70 and 130
   ?, was done; ammonia borane showed visible variations in its first
   release step, in which a fast rate helped reduce distortion in the
   release process. Finally, molecular simulation of ammonia borane using
   the Density Functional Theory (DFT) in calculations showed that dihedral
   rotation and stretching of the hydrogen bonds can occur before the first
   release step.},

Title = {Modification of Multi-Wall carbon nanotubes using controlled microwave
   Irradiation: Experimental determination of the enthalpy change},
Journal = {MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING B-ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL SOLID-STATE
   MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Irradiation of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was performed at
   different energy densities to characterize structural changes induced by
   a highly localized 2.45 GHz electric field. For this purpose, a
   transversal electric (TE102) resonant microwave cavity was designed and
   coupled to a standard 800 W microwave oven magnetron. The nanotubes were
   sealed inside a Pyrex reactor at 10(-4) Torr to avoid oxidation or
   reactions with the environment. Irradiated MWCNT properties were
   characterized using Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy, Thermogravimetry, Solubility tests and Transmission
   Electron Microscopy. In this work, the energy densities required to
   modify the MWCNT structure were obtained through an optical method. From
   an energy density of 82 J/cm(3), nanotubes presented nondestructive
   structural changes, loss of catalytic particles and a decrease of
   amorphous carbon structures on the surface. A more effective
   modification with high purity and clearly better structured walls was
   observed for 167 J/cm(3). Furthermore, it was determined that at an
   energy density of 6.9 KJ/mol a higher purification of MWCNTs is
   obtained. This value is in agreement with the enthalpy of formation
   reported for the MWCNTs. This experimental approach could be applied for
   the functionalization of carbon nanostructures. Finally, the
   purification process is easily scalable, environmentally friendly and
   makes maximum use of the irradiated energy.},

Abstract = {During sporulation Bacillus subtilis Mfd couples transcription to
   nucleotide excision repair (NER) to eliminate DNA distorting lesions.
   Here, we report a significant decline in sporulation following Mfd
   disruption, which was manifested in the absence of external DNA-damage
   suggesting that spontaneous lesions activate the function of Mfd for an
   efficient sporogenesis. Accordingly, a dramatic decline in sporulation
   efficiency took place in a B. subtilis strain lacking Mfd and the
   repair/prevention guanine oxidized (GO) system (hereafter, the GO
   system), composed by YtkD, MutM and MutY. Furthermore, the simultaneous
   absence of Mfd and the GO system, (i) sensitized sporulating cells to
   H2O2, and (ii) elicited spontaneous and oxygen radical-induced
   rifampin-resistance (Rif(r)) mutagenesis. Epifluorescence (EF), confocal
   and transmission electron (TEM) microscopy analyses, showed a decreased
   ability of GO mfd strain to sporulate and to develop the typical
   morphologies of sporulating cells. Remarkably, disruption of sda, sirA
   and disA partially, restored the sporulation efficiency of the strain
   deficient for Mfd and the GO system; complete restoration occurred in
   the RecA(-) background. Overall, our results unveil a novel Mfd
   mechanism of transcription-coupled-repair (TCR) elicited by 8-OxoG which
   converges in the activation of a RecA-dependent checkpoint event that
   control the onset of sporulation in B. subtilis.},

Abstract = {Light and electron microscopy have been used to study cell structure for
   many years, but atomic force microscopy is a more recent technique used
   to analyze cells, mainly due to the absence of techniques to prepare the
   samples. Isolated molecules or organelles, whole cells, and to a lesser
   extent in situ cell structure have been observed by different atomic
   force microscopy imaging modes. Here, we review efforts intended to
   analyze in situ the cell structures using approaches involving imaging
   of the surface of semithin sections of samples embedded in resin and
   sections prepared with an ultramicrotome. The results of such studies
   are discussed in relation to their implications to analyze the fine
   structure of organelles at the nanoscale in situ at enhanced resolution
   compared to light microscopy.},

Abstract = {Digital and analogue oscilloscopes are necessary instruments in any
   teaching and research laboratory. Today's oscilloscopes can acquire
   signals and represent them in the time and frequency domains. User
   manuals describe well the time base and the storage capability, but they
   do not mention the important relationship between the number of data and
   the sampling frequency. These parameters are directly responsible of the
   frequency resolution that can be attained in a Fourier analysis. In this
   paper we compare various oscilloscopes with respect to the capacity they
   give the user to choose the number of data and the sampling frequency
   independently, and thus determine the frequency resolution, and avoid
   large unnecessary data files. The analysis was performed acquiring a
   mono chromatic signal with different oscilloscopes and different time
   basis. Results for a 10 Khz signal showed that when the auto button was
   used, there was up to a 50\% error in the expected frequency, while only
   a 0.9 \% error was obtained with oscilloscopes that allow the user to
   choose independently the sampling frequency and the number of data.},

Abstract = {Even though supersonic flows have been studied for a long time, many
   questions remain unanswered about their behavior. The understanding of
   jet noise goes in parallel with the understanding of jet turbulence. It
   has been speculated that different kinds of vortex interactions in the
   near field, can produce sound. Also, that the interaction between the
   flow and the shock structure produces noise. It is now known that noise,
   in supersonic and subsonic jets, is made up of two basic components; one
   from the large turbulence structures and instability waves, and the
   other from the fine-scale turbulence. Measurements inside a supersonic
   jet are difficult. Hot wires are easily broken and homogeneous seeding
   for Laser Doppler and Particle Image Velocimetries is complicated. We
   have developed a non-intrusive technique that uses the heterodyne
   detection of Rayleigh scattering. The laser light scattered elastically
   by the molecules of the flow at a particular angle, has information
   about density fluctuations of a particular size. It can be shown that
   the signal that comes out of a quadratic photo detector is proportional
   to the spatial Fourier transform as a function of time, of the density
   fluctuations for a wave vector given by the scattering angle. The
   spectral analysis of the data has allowed us to identify fluctuations of
   different origins; entropic and acoustic. We have taken data at many
   points inside and outside the flow. The technique is sensitive to the
   wave vector so we can study fluctuations that propagate in different
   directions. Fluctuations in the direction of the flow are shifted in
   frequency with respect to fluctuations perpendicular to the flow at the
   same location. The frequency shift allows us to measure the local speed
   of the flow. Outside the flow, only acoustic fluctuations are detected.
   We have been able to determine the far field acoustic radiation pattern
   for a given wave vector. Inside the jet, the analysis is much more
   complicated because the acoustic and the entropic peaks overlap when we
   use simple Fourier transforms. However, with the use of parametric
   periodgrams we have been able to identify each type of fluctuation.
   Moreover, we found a third peak at a much lower frequency that appears
   and disappears as we move along the centerline of the jet. This peak
   appears also in other positions outside the centerline. We have used
   Rayleigh scattering and Schlieren to visualize the shock structure. We
   can then associate each spectrum with a position in the jet relative to
   the shock structure. The slow peak appears always at a shock, probably
   due to the interaction between the flow and the shock structure. We are
   now working on the visualization of the flow, and hope that the
   combination of all the techniques will give us further insight into the
   global behavior of the flow, especially in the interfaces between the
   flow and the shocks and between the mixing layer and the stationary
   fluid.},

Title = {Esterases activity in the axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum exposed to
   chlorpyrifos and its implication to motor activity},

Abstract = {The axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum is a neotenic salamander considered a
   good biological model due to its ability to regenerate limbs, tail,
   brain and heart cells. Nevertheless, severe reduction of A. mexicanum
   wild populations in the lacustrine area of Xochimilco, the natural
   habitat of the axolotl, could be related to several environmental
   pressures as the presence of organophosphate pesticides (OPPs),
   intensively applied in agricultural activities in Xochimilco. Thus the
   aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of environmentally
   realistic chlorpyrifos (CPF) concentrations, a OPP commonly used in this
   zone, on esterases activity (acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase)
   and bioconcentration of CPF and to relate them with the motor activity
   of A. mexicanum juveniles. Axolotls were exposed 48 h to 0.05 and 0.1 mg
   CPF/L, and the responses were evaluated at the end of the CPF exposure.
   Results suggest that CPF is bioconcentrated into axolotls and that the
   CPF internal concentrations are related with the observed inhibition
   activity of AChE (>50\%) and CbE (similar to 50\%). CPF concentration
   responsible of the inhibition of the 50\% of AChE activity (IC50) was
   estimated in 0.04 mg CPF/L; however IC50 for CbE activity was not
   possible to calculate since inhibition levels were lower than 50\%,
   results that suggest a higher resistance of CbE enzymatic activity to
   CPF. However, motor activity was a more sensitive endpoint to CPF
   poisoning since time that axolotls spent active and walking, frequency
   and speed of swimming, frequency of prey attack were reduced >90\% of
   control groups. The motor activity alterations in the axolotl could be
   related with the registered esterases inhibition. Thus important
   alterations on axolotls were identified even at short time and low
   concentrations of CPF exposure. Also, it was possible to link
   biochemical responses as esterases activity with higher levels of
   biological organization as behavior. This study provides tools for the
   regulation of the use of organophosphorus pesticides in the natural
   habitat of the axolotl. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to elevate gradient effect on diversity
   of Collembola, in a temperate forest on the northeast slope of
   Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Mexico. Four expeditions were organized from
   November 2003 to August 2004, at four altitudes (2,753, 3,015, 3,250 and
   3,687 m a.s.l.). In each site, air temperature, CO2 concentration,
   humidity, and terrain inclination were measured. The influence of
   abiotic factors on faunal composition was evaluated, at the four
   collecting sites, with canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). A total
   of 24,028 specimens were obtained, representing 12 families, 44 genera
   and 76 species. Mesaphorura phlorae, Proisotoma ca. tenella and
   Parisotoma ca. notabilis were the most abundant species. The highest
   diversity and evenness were recorded at 3,250 m (H' = 2.85; J' = 0.73).
   Canonical analyses axes 1 and 2 of the CCA explained 67.4\% of the
   variance in species composition, with CO2 and altitude best explaining
   axis 1, while slope and humidity were better correlated to axis 2. The
   results showed that CO2 is an important factor to explain Collembola
   species assemblage, together with slope and humidity.},

Abstract = {A bibliographic revision of sexual dimorphism indifferent families of

   in each group. We list several examples of the sexual dimorphism in
   different families of Collembola, which illustrate from some of the
   smallest differences between males and females to major differences
   between both sexes in some families. We show different cases of sexual
   dimorphism in Spinactaletes, Sminthurides, and the remarkable morphology
   of Guthriella muskegis. It seems that most of the cases of strong sexual
   dimorphism are related to aquatic habitats or behaviour still not fully
   understood. Species belonging to primarily aquatic families (fresh water
   or marine water) have the most evolved morphology, where males have
   clasping antennae to attach the females in order to avoid loosing them
   with the movement of the water.},

Abstract = {Ambystoma mexicanum is an endemic salamander of Xochimilco. a wetland of
   the basin of Mexico valley. Nowadays. axolotl populations are decreasing
   due environmental stressors. Particularly, studies about
   organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs; i.e. chlorpyrifos and malathion)
   toxicity are of great importance due to their intensive use in
   agricultural activities in Xochimilco. Thus, the aim of this study was
   to evaluate under controlled conditions the toxicity of chlorpyrifos
   (CPF) and malathion (MIT) on embryos and larvae (stage 44 and 54) of A.
   mexicanum. Embryos and larvae were exposure 96 h from 0.5 to 3 mg CPF
   L-1 and from 10 to 30 mg MLTL-1 in independent tests. Embryos at the end
   of this period were maintained 9d without pesticide in order to identify
   possible recuperation. Differences obtained in mortality, hatching
   success, development, morphological abnormalities, behaviour and
   activity, suggest that toxicity of CPF and MIT differs in embryos and
   larval stages. Embryos were less sensitive to OPPs acute exposure than
   axolotl larvae; additionally, toxicity of CPF in larval stages was
   greater than MIT. On the other hand, data obtained in axolotl embryos
   during the period of recuperation to CPF in particular as delay and
   inhibition of development, malformations and success of hatching,
   indicated that these responses turned out more sensitive than mortality.
   This study allowed to identify the toxicological potential of OPPs on
   early developmental stages of A. mexicanum and it is a valuable
   contribution for the future management of the axolotl wild population.

Abstract = {Recent phylogenetic analyses of members of the Tolypothrichaceae
   (Nostocales, Cyanobacteria) based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data have
   demonstrated that the soil-inhabiting members of the family belong to a
   clade separate from the aquatic and subaerial members of the family. The
   soil-inhabiting species clade includes Spirirestis, a monophyletic taxon
   originally defined by its tight spiral coiling. Most of the
   soil-inhabiting species have been identified in the past as belonging
   either to Hassallia or Tolypothrix, which are subaerial and aquatic
   taxa, respectively. A comprehensive study of the terrestrial
   Tolypothrichaceae led us to conclude that all terrestrial
   Tolypothrichaceae should be included in the genus Spirirestis, even
   though most of those isolates lack the spiral coiling diagnostic of the
   genus. Using a polyphasic approach, we recognize seven distinct clades
   in Spirirestis, which we split into seven species: S. rafaelensis (the
   generitype), S. californica comb. nov., S. pseudoramosissima comb. nov.,
   S. lignicolor sp. nov., S. williamsae sp. nov., S. hydroterrestris sp.
   nov., and S. atacamensis sp. nov. Spirirestis rafaelensis and S.
   californica are represented by multiple isolates, and we postulate that
   with time and further taxon sampling, some of the strains we included in
   these two species may be recognized as additional species. As the study
   of soil cyanobacteria continues, additional species of Spirirestis will
   likely be discovered and described.},

Title = {Maternal enrichment increases infantile spatial amnesia mediated by
   postnatal neurogenesis modulation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Infantile amnesia, the inability to form long-lasting episodic memories,
   is a phenomenon extensively known but with no clear understanding of its
   origins. However, a recent study showed that high rates of hippocampal
   postnatal neurogenesis degrade episodic-like memories in infants a few
   days after memory acquisition. Additionally, new studies indicate that
   exposure to an enriched environment in mice leads to high hippocampal
   neurogenesis in their offspring. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how
   this intergenerational trait affects the persistence of hippocampal
   memories. Therefore, we evaluated spatial memory retention in the
   offspring of enriched female mice after weaning to address this
   question. Ten days after spatial learning, we tested memory retention,
   observing that the offspring of enriched dams increased spatial memory
   failure; this finding correlates with high proliferation rates in the
   hippocampus. Furthermore, we evaluated the causal relationship between
   postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and memory failure using the
   antiproliferative drug Temozolomide (TMZ), which rescued spatial memory
   retrieval. Finally, we evaluated neuronal activity in the hippocampus
   quantifying the cells expressing the immediate early gene c-Fos. This
   evaluation showed engram modifications between groups. This neural
   activity pattern indicates that the high neurogenesis rates can modify
   memory engrams and cognitive performance. In conclusion, the inherited
   increase of hippocampal neurogenesis by enriched dams leads to plastic
   changes that exacerbate infantile amnesia in a spatial task.},

Title = {Counterdiagonal/nonpositive tail dependence in Vine copula
   constructions: application to portfolio management},

Abstract = {Accurately modelling the dependence structure between financial assets
   in a portfolio optimization framework has attracted growing attention in
   statistical and financial literature. Since in these assets several
   types of tail dependence might occur simultaneously, it is fundamental
   for parametric models to adequately replicate their whole tail
   dependence structure. This article investigates the effectiveness of
   Vine copulas in modelling counterdiagonal/nonpositive tail dependence,
   so far overlooked. We obtain expressions for their corresponding general
   tail dependence function which accounts for all dependences. This
   generalises the well-known approach of using the survival copula to
   study upper tail dependence, rather than using rotations on the data. We
   prove that, further to the already known flexibility to model asymmetric
   lower and upper tail dependence, Vine copulas can model all multivariate
   types of tail dependence simultaneously. In an empirical application,
   using a D-Vine copula with appropriate choices of bivariate linking
   copulas, we are able to capture the tail dependence structure of a
   portfolio of financial data in which different types of tail dependence
   coexist. Further to this, we test to what extent Vine copulas are able
   to model different types of tail dependence.},

Abstract = {Studies of scientific collaboration have introduced the concepts of
   collaborative networks. These networks may represent the social
   structure of a community of researchers or knowledge transmission in a
   specific country or economic sector. Cuban biopharmaceutical industry is
   an exceptional case study. This high-tech sector has achieved important
   development in the context of a ``Third World'' country, with a
   different political organization from the rest of the world. The main
   goal of this work is to characterize the Cuban biotechnology industry
   using collaborative networks. WoS database (1969-2016) was used and
   metric indicators of scientific collaboration obtained from the
   affiliation field. Netlike visualizations were produced with NodeXL
   software. BioCubaFarma meets about 50\% of the total scientific
   production of all Cuban sectors. Since its foundation, the sector has
   maintained significant internal and external collaboration, with Europe,
   Latin America and the United States of America. The United States
   collaboration has been significant in the absence of diplomatic
   relations with that country. Collaboration is greater among centers of
   the old ``scientific pole'' than among old companies of the
   pharmaceutical sector. Moreover, there is a correlation between the
   magnitude of the scientific production and the collaboration levels. For
   the development of biomedicine in Cuba, collaboration has not been
   solely endogenous but has also represented a significant transfer of
   knowledge between Cuba and other countries.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the meaning and effects of three ongoing and

   discourses; the articulation of knowledge production in global
   structures and central locations; and the feminist dialogues between
   geopolitical divides such as East/West', North/South',
   center/periphery', and indigenous/non-indigenous'. While the postwar
   East/West European divide is the specific focus, the article interweaves
   comparative elements from Latin America's decolonial debate throughout
   in order to analyze the ways in which feminism as a disputed discourse
   can be deployed to advance both neoliberalization as well as
   decolonization - and decolonization not only of feminism's discourses,
   but of capitalist modernity's discourses themselves.},

Title = {Potential neuroprotective role of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)
   in the brain},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {125},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {TGF beta 1 is a growth factor that is known to be expressed in most
   neurodegenerative diseases and after vascular accidents in the brain.
   TGF beta 1 downregulates the activity of activated microglia and
   promotes astrogliosis. It also prevents cell death by a known mechanism
   dependant on astrocytes and the secretion of the plasminogen activator
   inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). This mechanism can provide light on what is the
   mechanism of action of TGF beta 1 as a protective factor and it can
   provide the pharmacological principles in which this pathway could be
   used with therapeutic purposes. TGF beta 1 is upregulated in most
   neurodegenerative diseases, however, its expression appears dramatically
   blocked in Huntington's disease, the fastest of those diseases in
   progress after the onset. This fact suggests that TGF beta 1 slows down
   the neurodegenerative process, preventing tissue damage and neural
   apoptotic death. However, the exact details of TGF beta 1 action are
   still unknown and the physiological roles on the diseases are still
   mysterious. Interestingly, all the data regarding the roles of TGF beta
   1 in health and disease have been also confirmed with the use of
   transgenic knockouts and TGF beta 1 overexpressing mice. What possibly
   came as a surprise from the study of TGF beta 1 overexpressing models is
   that combining its neuroprotective and antiproliferative effects, this
   cytokine generates a significant disruption in the hippocampal circuitry
   with its consequent learning and memory deficit.},

Abstract = {New occurrences of the encrusting ``coralline{''} sponges Murania
   kazmierczaki Reitner, Murania megaspiculata Reitner, and Ceratoporella
   breviacanthostyla Reitner, often associated with microencrusters, are
   recorded from the Alpe di Specie (Seelandalpe) and Misurina near Cortina
   d'Ampezzo in the Dolomites in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. Some
   specimens with excellently preserved spicule pseudomorphs account for
   this finding. M. kazmierczaki and Ceratoporella breviacanthostyla
   normally appear to some extent associated with microencrusters and have
   strong framework-binding properties, while M. megaspiculata is seldom
   associated with any of them. The microencrusters involved in these
   associations include crusts similar to Pseudorothpletzella Schlagintweit
   and Gawlick, crusts similar to Wetheredella Wood, thalamid sponges,
   ``Tubiphytes{''} Maslov, single- and multi-chambered foraminifera, and
   Koskinobullina cf. K. socialis Cherchi and Schroeder. While the
   associations between M. kazmierczaki and Ceratoporella breviacanthostyla
   are certainly similar, some microencrusters related to one of them are
   not related to the other.},

Abstract = {A discussion of the kinematics of the relative rotational motion is
   presented. The central role of the correct understanding of the change
   of a vector is emphasized. The relation between the first and second
   derivatives of a vector in two reference systems is deduced. These
   relations are applied to a system fixed to the Earth surface. The
   hierarchy of approximations involved in this example is presented and
   the method of succesive approximations (perturbation theory) is
   introduced in this context.},

Title = {How does the influence of wind on the fall speed of raindrops change
   with altitude?},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {330},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rainfall is a vital component of the hydrological cycle, characterized
   by its variability. Research shows that factors such as wind influence
   the raindrop fall speed (v(f)), forcing deviations from theoretical
   estimates (v(t)). This study examines rainfall measurements collected
   using PWS100 disdrometers from 2015 to 2019 at two locations in Mexico
   (one near the Pacific coast and another in Central Mexico), focusing on
   how horizontal wind intensity (w, measured with a WindSonic4 anemometer)
   affects vf for raindrops with diameters (D) between 0.8 and 6 mm.
   Coastal data includes measurements collected during the passage of
   tropical cyclones over the sampling area. The data comparison between
   PWS100 and rain gauges when w > 10 m s(-1) exhibits significant biases,
   underscoring instrumental limitations by wind distortion. Findings
   indicate that average vf decreases compared to v(t) as wind intensity
   increases, but these differences are not statistically significant. The
   statistical and post-hoc outcomes for the v(f) standard deviation, used
   as a proxy of v(f) dispersion, demonstrate that w significantly affects
   v(f), with the effect growing stronger as w intensity increases.
   Further, the w effect also varies with raindrop size. Small raindrops (D
   < 1 mm) show both super-terminal and sub-terminal behavior, whereas
   mid-sized and large drops (D > 1 mm) predominantly exhibit sub-terminal
   behavior. At coastal sites, the wind impact is more pronounced due to
   the higher air density and the greater wind energy pushing over the
   raindrops. These outcomes support the need for further research to
   incorporate wind effects into numerical modeling and remote sensing
   instrumentation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {684},
Pages = {149-175},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In this work we study how to extend the concept of ``Fedi tion,{''}
   given for rigid and functorially finite subcategories in an
   extriangulated category C, to (n + 2) -rigid ones. We de-fine the
   reduction of such subcategories as the intersection of orthogonal
   complements when certain orthogonal condi-tion is satisfied and we prove
   that this reduction depends mainly on the subcategory itself beyond the
   type of extrian-gulated category for which belongs to. Specifically, we
   show that some results proven for Frobenius extriangulated cate-gories
   can be carried to extriangulated categories in general. We also study
   some properties among we can mention: weakly idempotent completeness,
   existence of enough E-projectives and E-injectives, and conditions to be
   Frobenius. That gen-eralization covers the usual case and, for the
   general case (for n >= 0 ) we provide several examples. Finally, we
   extend a well-known result given for the reduction in stably
   2-Calabi-Yau Frobenius extriangulated categories related with
   2-cluster<br /> tilting subcategories. 2025 Elsevier Inc. All rights are

Title = {Agathis vs. Hymenaea-trapping biases to interpret
   arthropod assemblages in ambers},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {23},

Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe genera Agathis (Coniferales: Araucariaceae) and Hymenaea
   (Fabales: Fabaceae) contain resin-producing tree species that are
   crucial for actuotaphonomic studies. While certain Cretaceous ambers
   likely originated from Agathis or Agathis-like trees, Hymenaea is the
   primary source of many Miocene ambers. Field studies were conducted in
   New Caledonia and Madagascar to collect Defaunation resin (resin
   produced after 1760 AD (Anno Domini)). Arthropods were collected with
   yellow sticky and Malaise traps in New Caledonia, Madagascar, and
   Mexico. Cretaceous and Miocene ambers, copals (2.58 Ma to 1760 AD), and
   Defaunation resins from various regions were analysed to compare
   arthropod trapping patterns.ResultsActuotaphonomic results show lower
   number of arthropods trapped in Agathis Defaunation resin, with a
   non-uniform distribution, compared to the abundant and uniformly
   distributed arthropods trapped in Hymenaea Defaunation resin. The lower
   number of arthropod inclusions in the trunk resin of the Agathis trees
   is attributed to the rapid polymerisation of that resin. Under the same
   experimental conditions, the arthropods in Agathis Defaunation resin
   plot far from the arthropods collected in the yellow sticky and Malaise
   traps, while the arthropods in Hymenaea Defaunation resin plot close to
   the arthropods in the yellow sticky traps.ConclusionsThese findings
   confirm different resin trapping patterns between Agathis and Hymenaea,
   with significant implications for interpreting the amber record. The
   fauna trapped by Hymenaea resin closely resembles the arthropod
   biocoenosis that live in and around the trunks, indicating autochthony
   and close relationship with the forest ecosystem, unlike Agathis resin.
   These results improve our understanding of arthropod trapping biases in
   resin and lead us to reconsider previously proposed interpretations of
   Cretaceous forest biocoenoses.},

Journal = {RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {L X-ray production cross sections of Ag induced by the collision of
   12C3+ and 13C3+ ions with energies between 2.6 MeV and 4.0 MeV were
   measured using thin targets. The different masses of the ions allowed
   the observation of dissimilarities in the cross sections which can be
   explained by Coulomb deflection and binding energy effects. Moreover,
   when the cross sections are plotted as a function of a reduced variable
   v1/v2L, where v1 is the ion velocity, and v2L is the average (Bohr)
   electron orbital velocity in the L shell, they closely follow a single
   curve, even as compared to previously published experimental data.
   Several theoretical models were also applied to compare with the results
   from this experiment, considering corrections caused by electron capture
   and multiple ionization, as well as the united atom effect. Two distinct
   atomic parameters databases were also employed. It was impossible to
   determine the theoretical model that describes the data with better
   accuracy, both the X-ray production cross sections and their ratios,
   because of the uncertainties; no significant difference was noted with
   the atomic parameters databases.},

Title = {In vivo effects of cadmium on signaling and secretion of
   pituitary gonadotrophs in male mice are time-dependent},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {267},

Abstract = {Cadmium is a heavy metal found widely in the environment, originating
   from industrial emissions, mining activities, phosphate fertilizers, and
   cigarette smoke. It is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that mimics
   essential metals such as calcium and zinc, interfering with hormone
   signaling. Due to its long biological half-life, cadmium bioaccumulates
   in organisms, raising concerns about its long-term effects on endocrine
   and reproductive health. Cadmium's reproductive toxicity is well
   documented, with studies highlighting its impact on gonadotropin
   regulation and testicular function. However, its specific effects on
   calcium (Ca2+) signaling in gonadotrophs remain poorly understood. This
   study aims to determine whether cadmium disrupts Ca2+-dependent
   signaling mechanisms essential for gonadotropin secretion. To address
   this, we used an adult male mouse model to assess pituitary cadmium
   accumulation, gonadotroph responsiveness to GnRH, and alterations in
   Ca2+ mobilization patterns. Our results show that cadmium exposure leads
   to pituitary bioaccumulation, prolonged endocrine disruption, and
   gonadotroph hyperplasia. Initially, gonadotroph responsiveness to GnRH
   declines, but over time, altered Ca2+ oscillation patterns and increased
   gonadotropin secretion emerge. A transition from normal oscillatory Ca2+
   signaling to biphasic responses was observed, along with sustained
   phospholipase C-beta (PLC beta) activation, suggesting persistent
   intracellular signaling disruptions. In addition, cadmium exposure
   resulted in testicular atrophy, increased apoptosis, and reduced sperm
   count. Testosterone levels declined, while the gonadotroph population
   increased, highlighting an imbalance in endocrine regulation. These
   findings suggest that cadmium induces reproductive toxicity through a
   combination of direct testicular damage and disruption of gonadotroph
   calcium signaling and hormone secretion, leading to testicular
   dysfunction that is relevant to public health.},

Title = {Radiation Grafting of Two PEG Derivatives onto PET: A Comparative Study
   for Biomedical Applications},
Journal = {MACROMOLECULAR MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 28},
Abstract = {This study shows an alternative route for the functionalization of
   polyethylene(terephthalate) (PET) for biomedical applications using
   gamma radiation instead of the conventional chemical method. Radiation
   technique is a versatile and effective strategy to improve the
   properties of polymers avoiding the use of toxic chemical agents that
   compromise their biocompatibility. Here, PET was modified by grafting
   poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA) and
   di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMEMA) using
   simultaneous and oxidative pre-irradiation methods. Results indicate
   that both PEG-methacrylate derivatives are successfully grafted (1-9\%)
   by oxidative pre-irradiation, while the simultaneous method yields
   negligible modification (<0.6\%). Characterization by infrared
   spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, contact angle, and swelling
   studies reveals similar physicochemical properties between PET-g-PEGMEMA
   and PET-g-DEGMEMA. However, mechanical properties denote that DEGMEMA
   increases PET stiffness, whereas PEGMEMA preserves the tensile elastic
   modulus of pristine PET. Similarly, protein adsorption (albumin) and
   fibroblast adhesion (BJ cells) assays show that both PEG-methacrylates
   promote the biological responses compared to pristine PET. Notably,
   samples with higher grafting densities support fibroblast adhesion and
   proliferation up to 5 days, attributing to increased hydrophilicity. No
   substantial difference between PEGMEMA and DEGMEMA grafts is observed
   regarding cell adhesion. These findings highlight the potential of
   PET-g-PEGMEMA and PET-g-DEGMEMA as promising candidates for biomedical
   technologies.},

Title = {Tissue-Specific Enhancement of Insulin Function and Restoration of
   Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion by Croton guatemalensis

Journal = {PHARMACEUTICALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Background/Objectives: Ethnopharmacological studies indicates that
   plant-based infusions are usually consumed by some people in advanced
   stages of diabetes, that is, when poor pancreatic dysfunction coexists
   with insulin resistance (IR). Current treatments aim to prevent
   beta-cell deterioration by promoting improved insulin function and/or
   enhancing pancreatic function to avoid the development of hyperglycemia.
   Therefore, Croton guatemalensis (Cg) and Eryngium cymosum (Ec), two
   medicinal plants with potential insulin-sensitizing effects described in
   previous studies, were assessed on parameters related to IR and on the
   architecture of pancreatic islets in rats exposed to a syrup containing
   8.8\% glucose and 5.2\% fructose in drinking water. Methods: After an
   8-week exposure to syrup, plant extracts were orally administered for
   four weeks at traditional doses (Cg: 30 mg/kg body weight; Ec: 470 mg/kg
   body weight). Body weight, food intake, and drinking water consumption
   were monitored. At the end of the study, IR surrogate indices were
   calculated, metabolic assays were performed, and white adipose tissues,
   liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and pancreas were extracted in fasting and
   postprandial state for lipid quantification (liver), measurement of Akt
   phosphorylation status by western blot (liver and muscle), and
   determination of insulin content by immunohistochemistry (pancreatic
   islets). Results: Both species decreased hepatic lipid content without
   promoting significant changes in visceral adiposity. Although they did
   not improve surrogate markers of fasting IR, both ameliorated insulin
   function, glucose tolerance, and restored the glucose-stimulated insulin
   secretory response in metabolic tests. Cg restored the insulin signaling
   response in liver and muscle, whereas Ec only did so in muscle.
   Moreover, both appeared to enhance insulin pancreatic content or restore
   pancreatic islet population. Conclusions: Cg and Ec can reverse the IR
   phenotype in a tissue-specific manner and improve pancreatic function.},

Title = {Sediment phosphorus mobility in a semi-arid wetland with highly
   fluctuating hydrology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background Phosphorus (P) mobility and internal loading from sediments
   are critical processes driving eutrophication in wetlands, particularly
   in those experiencing strong water level fluctuations. In such systems,
   redox oscillations, temperature variations, and microbial activity
   interact to influence the bioavailability and release of sediment-bound
   P. However, the relative roles of abiotic and biotic mechanisms in P
   mobilization remain poorly understood, particularly in semi-arid
   wetlands affected by prolonged drought and intermittent flooding.
   Results This study experimentally assessed the release of soluble
   reactive phosphorus (SRP) from sediments collected in Las Tablas de
   Daimiel National Park (central Spain), a semi-arid wetland with
   contrasting hydrological regimes. Sediments were incubated under both
   aerobic and anaerobic conditions across three air temperatures (4, 20,
   and 35 degrees C), with treatments isolating the effects of abiotic and
   biotic processes. We hypothesize that microbial processes, particularly
   those linked to Fe-P cycling, are key drivers of P mobilization in
   wetlands. Regression analyses confirmed a strong negative correlation
   between Fe:PO4 ratios and SRP concentrations (R = - 0.598, p < 0.001),
   indicating a key role for iron redox dynamics in controlling internal P
   loading. Biotic + abiotic treatments exhibited consistently lower SRP
   release than abiotic-only controls, suggesting that microbial processes
   may suppress rather than enhance P mobilization. SRP release was highest
   in sediments exposed to recurrent anoxia and high Fe content, and lowest
   in intermittently dry sites where prolonged desiccation likely
   stabilized P in mineral phases. A structural equation model confirmed
   that Fe-2(+) was the dominant driver of SRP release, while Fe-3(+) and
   microbial activity had weaker, but significant, effects. Site-specific
   interactions between dissolved oxygen availability and redox conditions
   were also critical in determining P fluxes. Conclusions The findings
   emphasize the dominant role of abiotic Fe-P coupling in wetland sediment
   dynamics, challenging the common assumption that microbial activity is
   the primary driver of phosphorus release. The study also highlights the
   influence of temperature, redox conditions, and site-specific
   hydrological regimes on SRP mobilization. While microcosm experiments
   provided mechanistic insights, their limitations underscore the need for
   complementary field-based studies. These results have direct
   implications for wetland restoration and eutrophication control. They
   also inform catchment-scale land use planning by highlighting the
   vulnerability of internal phosphorus release in semi-arid systems. In
   such environments, climate-driven hydrological variability may intensify
   internal nutrient loading.},

Abstract = {The multidrug resistance phenotype is a major cause of cancer
   chemotherapy failure. To identify novel chemosensitizing glycolipids
   capable of modulating resistance in vinblastine-resistant human breast
   cancer cells, a methanol-soluble extract from the flowers of Ipomoea
   murucoides Roem. \& Schult., Convolvulaceae, commonly known as cazahuate
   in Nahuatl (Mexico), was used. The extract was fractionated through
   affinity-directed fractionation using liver glucose-6-phosphatase
   enzymes. Biological evaluation revealed that the affinity-directed
   fractions significantly enhanced vinblastine activity in resistant
   cells, achieving up to a 57-fold increase, compared to a 43-fold
   enhancement by reserpine (positive control). Additionally, molecular
   docking analyses were performed to determine the ligand-binding sites of
   selected murucoidins in P-glycoprotein (ABCB1). The selected glycolipids
   interacted with the transmembrane domains and the nucleotide-binding
   domain 2 (NBD2) site of P-glycoprotein, showing binding energies of -
   3.65 and - 4.97 kcal/mol for murucoidin V, and - 6.85 and - 5.2 kcal/mol
   for murucoidin XIV, respectively. However, their stronger binding
   affinities and more extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with the
   transmembrane domains suggest that this region is their primary site of
   action. These findings suggest that I. murucoides glycolipids may
   overcome multidrug resistance by targeting P-glycoprotein, offering
   potential as chemosensitizing agents.},

Abstract = {The emergence of multicellular invasive behavior is a key characteristic
   of various biological processes, including wound healing, development,
   and tissue regeneration. In this study, we develop a lattice-gas
   cellular automaton (LGCA) model to explore the role of inhibitory
   feedback in the invasive behavior of a hierarchical lineage composed of
   stem cells and differentiated cells. We consider both non-spatial and
   spatial stochastic models to investigate how spatial interactions
   influence invasion dynamics. Our findings suggest that inhibitory
   feedback from differentiated cells significantly impacts the invasive
   potential of stem cells. In addition, local fluctuations induce unstable
   fronts that move with relatively low speed. Finally, we explore the
   implications of our work for understanding the regulation of
   multicellular dynamics in various pathophysiological contexts.},

   infectious disease in Panama, and for which we lack key details on
   important life-history characteristics. Here, we provide information on
   L. warszewitschii life-history and reproductive traits, including
   descriptions of oviposition habitat, egg masses, tadpole growth rates,
   and vocalization. We recorded egg masses of L. warszewitschii attached
   to rocks in shallow stream pools, with a mean of 455 eggs per mass, and
   documented tadpole growth in captivity at a rate of 3.4 mm in total
   length per week, with metamorphosis (Gosner stage 42) beginning after 14
   weeks. Additionally, we analyzed L. warszewitschii vocalizations, which
   consisted of eight or nine two-note groups, and showed considerable
   variation in repetition rate, inflection, and dominant frequency within
   a single calling bout. The non-pulsatile calls that we recorded may
   represent an undescribed call from the known trill. The differences in
   traits between previously published studies and our findings may arise
   from previously undescribed life-history characteristics and/or
   intraspecific variation. The information that we provide forL.
   warszewitschii can inform future conservation management planning for
   this and other threatened amphibian species in the Neotropics.},

Abstract = {Oregano (Origanum vulgare) cultivation is of great economic importance
   in Peru. Tacna stands out as its main producer. However, the presence of
   phytopathogenic fungi represents a challenge for its production. This
   study aimed to characterize both the morphological and molecular levels
   of the causal agent of crown and root rot in a crop field in the
   Camilaca district, Candarave, Tacna. To this end, systematic sampling
   was carried out using the five-gold method, collecting plants with
   typical symptoms. Fungi were isolated from diseased roots and
   characterized using macroscopic and microscopic morphological analysis
   as well as sequencing and multilocus phylogenetic analysis (ITS, 28S,
   HIS3, TEF1, TUB2). In addition, pathogenicity tests were performed on
   healthy plants to confirm the infectivity of the isolates. The results
   demonstrated that root rot was caused by a complex of phytopathogenic
   fungi through phylogenetic analysis of Dactylonectria torresensis,
   Fusarium oxysporum, F. iranicum, and F. redolens. These findings
   represent the first report of these species as causal agents of oregano
   root rot in Peru, highlighting the need for integrated management
   strategies that reduce the economic impact of these diseases and
   contribute to the sustainability of the crop in key producing regions
   such as Tacna.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel approach to addressing supply chain and
   logistics challenges using ramified optimal transport. This framework
   provides a flexible and efficient means of modeling nonlinear and
   realistic scenarios within natural and complex transportation networks,
   particularly in real-time applications where route optimization is
   critical. The problem considered involves determining optimal warehouse
   locations and devising distribution strategies for delivering goods from
   suppliers to customers. To this end, we developed two new estimation
   algorithms and benchmarked them against traditional and heuristic
   methods. The proposed algorithms demonstrated competitive performance in
   solving supply chain and logistics problems, with one of them achieving
   the best results in terms of computational cost. Finally, the algorithms
   were applied to real-world data from the cement industry, successfully
   producing real-time optimal routes. This was made possible by the
   incorporation of a carefully designed distance function in the cost
   modeling.},

Title = {Proximal and distal impacts of a megaproject on ecosystem services in
   rural territories of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Introduction Megaprojects are strategically envisioned to boost regional
   development. Still, they drive ecosystem changes that generate
   ecological impacts in space and time beyond construction sites,
   particularly those established in rural regions, as their economic goals
   often trigger broader landuse changes. These distal ecological impacts
   are frequently overlooked, but their evaluation is critical to assess
   changes in ecosystem services that provide quality of life to the local
   people. To understand the effects on ecosystem services, this study
   analyzed both the proximal and distal impacts of the ``Tren Maya{''}
   railroad megaproject.Methods Using InVest models, which provide spatial
   quantitative analysis using land use information, among other variables.
   We evaluated three ecosystem services: habitat quality, pollination, and
   carbon sequestration across the Yucat \& aacute;n Peninsula, Mexico. We
   assessed historical (2002) and recent (2017) ecosystem services. We
   projected three scenarios to 2050: (a) future without train, land use
   change using previous trends, (b) proximal impacts of the Tren Maya, and
   (c) combined proximal and distal impacts of the Tren Maya.Results
   Results show significant declines of all evaluated ecosystem services in
   the three future scenarios, with the most pronounced reductions with
   distal impacts. Ecosystem types have different impacts, where tropical
   rainforests and tropical dry forest are the most affected.
   Geographically, the northwestern region of the Peninsula (the most
   populated) is more affected, while protected areas in the southern
   region mitigate some impacts.Discussion The analysis shows that distal
   impacts are more significant in the habitat quality than the other two
   ecosystem services evaluated. Our findings underscore the need for
   megaproject evaluations to incorporate both proximal and distal impacts
   to ensure sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The Metropolitan Area of Queretaro (MAQ) is a significant industrial hub
   in central Mexico whose air quality, including high concentrations of
   particulate matter (PM), poses a risk to the population. However, there
   have not been many studies on the sources and processes that influence
   the concentration of atmospheric pollutants. We used aerosol chemical
   composition and meteorological data from 1 January to 15 May 2022, along
   with back-trajectory modeling, to investigate emission sources not
   previously described in the region and the impact of local and regional
   meteorology on the chemical composition of aerosols. Furthermore, this
   study presents the first quantitative analysis of nitroaromatic
   compounds (NACs) in particulate matter in the MAQ using
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution
   mass spectrometry. The NAC concentrations ranged from 0.086 to 3.618 ng
   m-3, with the highest concentrations occurring during a period of
   atmospheric stability. The secondary inorganic and organic fractions of
   the PM were the most abundant (50\%) of the PM concentration throughout
   the campaign. Local and regional meteorology played a significant role
   in the variability of PM chemical composition, as it influenced
   oxidation and transport processes. The results reveal that emissions
   from biomass burning are a recurrent PM source, and regional emissions
   significantly impact the organic fraction of the PM. These results
   underscore the importance of considering both local and regional sources
   in assessing air pollution in the region.},

Title = {Conceptualizing the public good for genomics in the global South: a
   cross-disciplinary roundtable dialogue},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Since the Human Genome Project, initiatives to genetically sequence and
   profile populations around the world have expanded rapidly. The
   rationales guiding this expansion are diverse: on the one hand, the
   concentration of genetic technologies in the global North threatens to
   widen the yawning gaps in healthcare available in advanced versus
   developing nations. On the other, more `genetic diversity' in global
   databases can reveal new points of genetic variation associated with
   health or disease. This promises to pave the way to a more personalized
   medicine of the future-more powerful and prosperous, with tailored
   prevention regimens and genetic treatments targeted to every
   individual's specific genetic vulnerabilities. These rationales are
   advanced to claim a public good case for genomics. However, the
   expansion of genomics to underserved populations in the global South has
   provoked many sociopolitical and ethical challenges. Critics have
   pointed to the inevitable entanglement of genomics with private
   commercial interests. These concerns are overlaid on deeper anxieties
   stemming from global asymmetries in scientific and technological power,
   and historical patterns of value extraction from colonized and
   marginalized populations. How then do we disentangle the public good?
   How do we build a genomics science that is just and equitable for the
   vast majority of the world? This conversation convenes leading genomics
   practitioners and critical science studies scholars to address these
   questions. We draw on an ongoing transdisciplinary dialogue, integrating
   the natural and social sciences, and bring together perspectives and
   scholars from the global North and South. Our aim is to cultivate a more
   holistic and grounded engagement with the scientific and political
   challenges we face, to truly understand the requirements of a genomics
   that centers the question of justice.},

Title = {The Controversial Issue of Hypervitaminosis B12 as Prognostic Factor of
   Mortality: Global Lessons from a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {NUTRIENTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Objective: To test whether hypervitaminosis B12 is useful for prognosis
   of all-cause mortality. Methods: Meta-analysis of longitudinal,
   observational, epidemiologic studies. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science,
   Google Scholar, and ProQuest One Academic were searched from inception
   to 30 June 2024. Studies including humans aged >= 18 years with
   hypervitaminosis B12, and in whom the outcome variable was all-cause
   mortality, were included. Two reviewers screened, abstracted (using
   standardized data collection sheet), and appraised articles (ROBINS-E
   framework) independently. Frequentist and Bayesian approaches were used
   for the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 28 studies were included in
   the meta-analysis (among the 69,610 participants, 15,815 all-cause
   deaths were reported). High serum levels of B12 increased marginally the
   risk of all-cause mortality specifically among chronic diseases (RR =
   1.40; 95\% IC = 1.05 to 1.85) and hospitalized (RR = 1.57; 95\% IC =
   1.19 to 2.07). In the meta-regression, these results were not
   statistically significant. The Bayesian analysis confirmed the risks of
   the mentioned groups; however, it was limited by the number of studies
   that contained the necessary information. The methodology applied and
   the clinical heterogeneity of each included study bring up the idea that
   artefacts might be involved when mortality is found to be high for
   hypervitaminosis B12. Conclusions: This meta-analysis did not show that
   hypervitaminosis B12 represents a higher risk of all-cause mortality in
   adults.},

Title = {History-dependent switch-like differentiation of keratinocytes in
   response to skin barrier damage},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The epidermis is formed by layers of keratinocytes with increasing
   levels of differentiation towards the outer skin called skin barrier,
   which protects our body from environmental stressors and dehydration.
   When skin barrier is damaged, keratinocyte differentiation is triggered,
   and terminally differentiated keratinocytes express skin barrier
   components, achieving skin barrier homeostasis. However, the dynamic and
   quantitative understanding of how skin barrier homeostasis is achieved
   remains unknown. To elucidate how keratinocyte differentiation is
   dynamically affected by skin barrier damage, especially in the presence
   of infection, we developed a mechanistic model of keratinocyte
   differentiation by integrating experimental results from 101 manually
   curated publications. To extract the key regulatory structure of the
   model, we applied model reduction, called the kernel reduction
   methodology to obtain the minimal reaction network. The key regulatory
   structure is characterised by positive feedback with cooperativity
   between Np63 and Stat3, two master regulators of keratinocyte
   differentiation. This regulatory structure gives rise to bistable
   behaviour for the expression of terminal differentiation markers of
   keratinocytes when the skin barrier is damaged and the extracellular
   calcium level is varied. We validated the model by confirming it
   produces the history-dependent and switch-like keratinocyte
   differentiation observed in in vitro reversibility assays. Analysis of
   the validated model shows that bacterial infection augments
   keratinocytes' sensitivity to skin barrier damage by decreasing the
   level required for differentiation and de-differentiation. Our results
   suggest the mechanisms by which skin barrier homeostasis is maintained
   even when the skin is exposed to fluctuating environments that perturb
   the barrier composition.},

Title = {Flavonoid Content During the Growth and Floral Development of
   Calendula officinalis L.},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2025},
Number = {220},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) with multiple uses, notably its
   medicinal applications due to its richness and diversity in secondary
   metabolites, such as flavonoids, which possess anti-inflammatory and
   antioxidant properties.This study analyzed plant growth and biomass
   distribution, as well as total flavonoid concentration in tubular,
   ligulate flowers, and flower heads throughout floral development. Floral
   initiation and differentiation occurred five weeks after
   transplantation, following a sigmoid pattern of biomass accumulation in
   its organs as well as in plant height. Aerial organs reached a maximum
   biomass of 76 g/ g/plant on day 69. The maximum absolute growth rate was
   2.38 g/day at 62 days, while the highest relative growth rate was
   recorded in reproductive organs on day 48 (0.137 g/g/ day). Flavonoids,
   expressed as quercetin equivalents, showed higher concentrations during
   stages ranging from flower buds to fully opened flower heads (145-177
   mg/ g of dry matter). These findings emphasize the importance of
   harvesting at optimal stages to maximize flavonoid content and leverage
   their potential for therapeutic and commercial applications.},

Journal = {CATENA},

Volume = {256},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Lake eutrophication causes aquatic ecosystem changes that can be
   difficult to trace without a long-term perspective on water quality
   variables. This paper presents a study of a sediment core collected from
   Lake Montebello, which yielded such a long-term perspective of trophic
   state changes. We assumed that microfossil assemblages in the sediment
   had remained stable over time, as this lake is considered
   ``pristine{''}. However, three distinctive lake periods over the last
   century were identified, with rapid environmental changes occurring
   similar to 1960 and 2007-2010. Initially the lake was ultraoligotrophic
   (period A, 1930-1960), but it transitioned to oligo - mesotrophic
   conditions (period B, 1960 - 2010) and developed a dense bottom
   vegetation cover as erosion increased. Fire events during the 1998 ``El
   Ni \& ntilde;o{''} and deforestation occurring between 2007 and 2010
   increased lake turbidity and reduced light penetration, causing a
   decline in bottom vegetation cover and promoting diatom and testate
   amoebae species turnover. The landscape stabilized after similar to 2010
   and lake productivity declined, but the diatom community shifted from
   periphytic to pelagic dominance and from larger to smaller taxa, better
   suited to nutrient-limited, warmer conditions (period C). During the
   last century, changes in sediment and nutrient loadings altered the
   trophic status and functional diversity of this lake, and its
   limnological history is far from ``pristine{''}. Climate warming likely
   contributed to reduced ecosystem resilience and favored species
   replacement.},

Abstract = {We show that every regular domain D in Minkowski space R n , 1 which is
   not a wedge admits an entire hypersurface whose domain of dependence is
   D and whose scalar curvature is a prescribed constant (or function,
   under suitable hypotheses) in ( - infinity , 0 ). Under rather general
   assumptions, these hypersurfaces are unique and provide foliations of D.
   As an application, we show that every maximal globally hyperbolic Cauchy
   compact flat spacetime admits a foliation by hypersurfaces of constant
   scalar curvature, generalizing to any dimension previous results of
   Barbot-B \& eacute;guin-Zeghib (for n = 2 n=2 ) and Smith (for n = 3 n=3

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Given a dynamical system (X, f) and a positive integer n, we study the
   concept of strong transitivity in the induced map f xn: Xn-{*} Xn. The
   main problem is to figure out when the strong transitivity of f x2
   implies the strong transitivity of f xn. In certain spaces, such as
   finite connected graphs, we show that if f x2 is strongly transitive
   then f is strongly mixing which also implies that f xnis strongly
   transitive for any n. We also give an example of a map f : S1 -{*} S1
   which is strongly mixing but not exact, showing that our result is
   optimal in finite graphs. (c) 2025 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Journal = {PHYTOCHEMISTRY LETTERS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {67},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Annona purpurea is a species of the Annonaceae family that
   biosynthesizes more than 50 alkaloids, most of them with
   benzylisoquinoline structure. Some alkaloids perform defense functions
   and can be grouped from the ecological perspective as constitutive and
   induced metabolites. Induced metabolites are expressed in response to
   changes in abiotic or biotic conditions that trigger plant stress. Few
   studies have been conducted on alkaloid production as a function of
   biotic stress. In this work, the response of the alkaloid metabolism of
   A. purpurea seedlings to infection with fungi Curvularia lunata and
   Rhizopus stolonifer was analyzed. To determine the alkaloid profile,
   methanolic extracts were obtained from leaves, stems and roots of
   control and infected seedlings, which were analyzed by Gas
   Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. Chemical diversity was
   determined by the presence and organ-specific abundance and by means of
   the adapted ecological indices of Margalef, Shannon and Simpson. In
   addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), PERMANOVA and paired
   PERMANOVA were performed. Induced responses with C. lunata and
   especially with R. stolonifer were found. Results indicate that
   seedlings have an arsenal of available alkaloids, some of which respond
   according to the infecting phytopathogen.},

Abstract = {The lists of tick species in Tamaulipas are inconsistent because
   previous studies have focused on only a few tick genera, or general
   works where ticks are included among other groups of mites or
   arthropods. For this reason, the objective of this study was to collect
   previous records and add new ones to generate an updated list of ticks
   in the state of Tamaulipas and to know their richness, hosts and
   geographic distribution. For this, a search for published works was
   carried out through bibliographic searches in databases and academic
   profiles with different combinations of words used in Spanish and
   English. In addition, records were obtained from national and
   international databases. Also, we obtained ticks from vegetation and
   some vertebrates from February 2022 to February 2023 in two localities:
   1) Ejido El Sabinito, Soto la Marina, and 2) Ejido Santa Ana, Victoria.
   Likewise, we collected ticks during a single visit to two other
   localities in July Victoria. A total of 236 records were compiled of
   previous works, databases, and new collections. The records correspond
   to 34 tick species, plus new records of Ixodes ca. boliviensis and
   Amblyomma rotundatum, increasing the list to 36 species distributed in
   35 of the 43 municipalities in the state of Tamaulipas. Of the total
   number of records, 177 corresponded to humans and domestic animals as
   hosts. Some species of ticks registered for the state can transmit
   pathogens that cause diaseases such as: anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis,
   babesiosis, rickettsiosis and Lyme. Despite the record of ticks in
   Tamaulipas, the inventory is far from complete, it is important to
   continue with research focused on wild hosts.},

Abstract = {Pure ZnO microstructured phosphor of cool white, warm white, orange and
   turquoise color was prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD). The
   color variation was solely a consequence of controlled variation in the
   relative contents of the native crystalline defect. Only hexagonal
   wurtzite phase of ZnO with good stoichiometry without additional phases
   and without crystalline parameters variation was observed. The band gap
   energy was successfully maintained between 3.05 and 3.22 eV, with an
   additional high optical absorption edge at 551 nm, associated with the
   excess of Zn ions in crystalline structure of ZnO. The absorption
   centers were categorized into thirteen bands and associated with energy
   levels related to native defects. The photoluminescence (PL) and
   cathodoluminescence (CL) emission spectra coincidentally exhibited four
   main peaks around 465 nm, 504 nm, 596 nm and 646 nm. The deconvolution
   of these spectra revealed emission bands that were categorized into 15
   energy ranges. The energy associated with these bands closely matches
   the energy of the absorption bands identified by transmittance and
   reflectance spectroscopy without the need to consider the existence of
   additional acceptor levels close to the valence band that have not been
   observed experimentally, which allowed to propose a purely experimental
   energy diagram for ZnO. HR-TEM analysis revealed that for the cool white
   emitting ZnO, an irregular and incomplete hexagonal microstructure could
   be responsible for its native defect content that gives rise to its
   particular cool white emission.},

Title = {The NE-SW Axaxalpa fault system in the eastern sector of the
   Transmexican Volcanic Belt: Kinematics, geometry, and recent activity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {158},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The Axaxalpa fault system (AFS), located in the eastern sector of the
   Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), consists of NE-SW oriented faults
   that record two deformation events. The oldest event (D1) corresponds to
   faults with left strike-slip kinematics, which were active during the
   late Miocene. These faults cutiddle-late Miocene volcanic structures in
   the northern zone of the eastern sector of the TMVB and are likely
   associated with intrusive bodies along their trace. The second event
   (D2) is related to the normal movement of the NE-SW faults. This
   activity started in the Pliocene and continued into the Holocene. The
   fault-slip data inversion of the faults located in the southern zone of
   the AFS for the D2 suggests that the main stress directions are 131
   degrees/59 degrees (trend/dip), 223 degrees/01 degrees, and 314
   degrees/31 degrees for sigma(1), sigma(2), and sigma(3) respectively,
   and stress ratio R = (sigma 2- sigma 3)/(sigma 1- sigma 3) = 0.44. In
   the northern sector, the main stress directions are 292 degrees/76
   degrees, 047 degrees/06 degrees, 138 degrees/12 degrees for sigma(1),
   sigma(2), and sigma(3) respectively, and stress ratio R = 0.45. The
   mesoscopic fractures associated with D2 are mainly extensional and
   hybrid and have three orientations: NE-SW, NNW-SSW, and similar to E-W.
   Additionally, the morphological lineaments primarily show a NE-SW
   orientation, with subordinate NW-SE and similar to E-W orientations. The
   D2 event controls the volcanic vent's location and forms monogenetic
   volcanic lineaments parallel to the NE-SW faults.
   Based on the AFS orientation, it is clear that this fault system is
   incompatible with the field stress recorded in the TMVB. This fact
   suggests that the AFS is probably related to a reactivated basement
   structure inside of a tridimensional deformation with a complex
   deformation history. In the southern zone of the eastern sector of the
   TMVB, the Cretaceous Papalutla fault probably represents the
   continuation of the AFS.},

Abstract = {The assessment of the sustainability status of territories is a
   prerequisite for the development of public policy strategies to be
   implemented on them aimed at attaining established sustainability goals.
   A socioenvironmental systems perspective, in which economic, social and
   environmental aspects constituting these territories and their
   interactions between them are considered, allows for a comprehensive
   analysis of the dynamics of these systems. Given the complexity of such
   systems, sets of indicators are required to simplify and quantify them.
   Here, we developed a model of the dynamics of the socioenvironmental
   system associated with the Usumacinta River basin (URB), a 77,000 km(2)
   area shared by Guatemala and Mexico. We fed this model with information
   from a system of 51 sustainability indicators and modeled the
   relationships between these indicators, as well as developed indices to
   visualize the sustainability status of these components. This allowed us
   to evaluate the impact of different scenarios of change in the
   indicators of public policy on the entire URB system. We determine that
   the URB displays a good state of its natural component and of the impact
   human activities have in the territory; however, components associated
   with the human activities themselves, their drivers, the social
   condition and the human assets displayed differences in their
   sustainability status between countries. Concerning the evaluation of
   scenarios of changes in the magnitude of the public policy indicators,
   we established that Ecosystem Services payment increases the overall
   sustainability of the territory. We conclude that both environmental
   protection and social investment should be considered if
   socioenvironmental sustainability is to be attained.},

Title = {Diversity and morphology of marine planktonic species of the diatom

Journal = {PHYTOTAXA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {696},

Abstract = {Based on the analysis of net-phytoplankton and bottle samples obtained
   during different oceanographic cruises (period 1986-2019) along coasts
   of the Mexican Pacific, we studied the diversity, morphology and
   distribution of species of the diatom family Thalassionemataceae.
   Diatoms of this family are marine and planktonic forms, with a
   characteristic ``needle shape{''} and extremely long cells, which may
   form chains (colonies) and may be abundant in polar, subpolar, and in
   tropical and subtropical waters. Twelve taxa (11 species and one
   variety) belonging to three genera of the Thalassionemataceae were
   studied by light-, scanning-, and transmission electron microscopy (LM,
   SEM and TEM), including seven Thalassionema taxa (6 species and one
   variety), two Thalassiothrix species and three Lioloma species.
   Additionally, two unidentified morphotypes were found and studied by
   SEM; they are related to known species but differ in some characters and
   current observations are insufficient to propose new taxa. Morphological
   details of critical characters are described for each species, such as
   valve symmetry (iso-or heteropolarity), different ends (head-pole and
   foot-pole), structure of the marginal areolae, presence of marginal
   spines and bubble-like structures, apical protrusions or spines and
   labiate processes; in some species the formation of chains and the
   chloroplasts cell content were documented, as well as the structure of
   cingular bands. Additionally, the particular morphological character of
   the double lipped structures forming the internal labiate structure of
   the apical rimoportulae was detected in three Thalassionema identified
   species and one Thalassionema unidentified species. A contemporary
   account of the family is provided here, and four new records are
   annotated, including Thalassionema kuroshioensis, a recently described
   species, and the warm-water forms Thalassionema synedriforme,
   Thalassiothrix gibberula and Thalassiothrix spathulata. We found that
   Thalassionema frauenfeldii, T. kuroshioensis, T. nitzschioides (and its
   variety parvum) and T. pseudonitzschioides, Lioloma delicatulum, L.
   elongatum and L. pacificum were widespread along the Mexican Pacific,
   whereas Thalassionema bacillare, T. synedriforme, and Thalassiothrix
   gibberula and T. spathulata were more restricted to tropical and
   subtropical areas.},

   (Ardeidae)},
Journal = {PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Clinostomum Leidy, 1856 is a globally distributed group of endoparasites
   that reside attached to the mucosa of the mouth cavity and oesophagus of
   fish-eating birds (mainly herons) in the adult stage, whereas larvae
   known as metacercariae ({''}yellow grubs{''}) damage freshwater fish and
   amphibians that serve as secondary intermediate hosts. In the Nearctic
   and Neotropical regions of Mexico, species of the genus Clinostomum have
   been intensively studied, revealing seven species that share a common
   ancestor. In the present study, sequences of the ITS from nuclear
   ribosomal DNA and cox 1 from mitochondrial DNA were generated for C.
   tataxumui, C. cichlidorum, and an unidentified species identified as
   lineage 3 sensu Perez-Ponce de Leon et al. 2026, which is distributed
   sympatrically in Mexico and Middle America. The objectives of the
   present study were to 1) describe a new species of Clinostomum, named
   herein as Clinostomum chaacci n. sp., which combines morphological and
   molecular characters; 2) analyse the population genetic structure of two
   previously described species in addition to C. chaacci n. sp.; and 3)
   infer phylogeographic patterns using cox 1 sequences. The inferred
   phylogeographic results indicated that the populations of C. tataxumui,
   and C. cichlidorum lack a geographic structure with high haplotype
   diversity, low nucleotide diversity, and low Fst values among the
   populations with negative values on the neutrality test, suggesting that
   the populations are expanding. In contrast, the populations of C.
   chaacci n. sp., are less connected and subdivided into smaller
   populations, leading to slight genetic differentiation, suggesting that
   the populations have undergone significant demographic changes, such as
   recent expansion or selection effects.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Abstract = {Understanding the role of mangroves in microplastic (MPs)
   bioaccumulation is crucial to addressing the pollution in these
   ecosystems, particularly in restored areas. Here, we 1) evaluate the MPs
   plastic-biota-sediment accumulation factor (pBSAf) in the fiddler crab
   Minuca rapax and 2) describe MPs type, colour, and polymeric
   characteristics in areas with varying restoration and degradation levels
   in the Southern Gulf of Mexico. We used regression models to evaluate
   the role of mangrove tree height, basal area, and crab individuals'
   density in explaining pBSAf. The highest pBSAf values were observed in
   natural and restored mangrove areas, particularly those with higher crab
   densities and taller trees. MPs were more diverse in composition in both
   crabs and sediments from natural areas. Mangrove biota tissue's
   bioaccumulation may provide insights into ecosystem health and food web
   impacts and indicate restoration progress.},

Abstract = {In this work, we propose an evaluation method to identify departures
   from a parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC) with respect to a
   homemade prototype. It is convenient to divide the detection plane into
   equal circular areas and consider the centroid for a tiny bundle of rays
   in the center of each area, so by using a backward ray-tracing, we find
   exact equations to design object patterns that are projected onto a PTSC
   to produce by reflection a uniform and predefined pattern onto the
   detection plane. The object pattern is displayed in a liquid crystal
   display forming a set of bright spots on a complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor sensor after being reflected by the surface
   under test. The discrete sampling guarantees the correspondence between
   the image and object points. We carry out the surface reconstruction by
   means of a deterministic iterative algorithm that uses the vector field
   of the normal vectors to obtain the surface shape under test. To prevent
   the misalignments of the measurement system from affecting the results,
   we propose a simple method for calibrating the orientation and position
   of each element that forms part of the experimental setup. Finally, we
   recovered the radius of curvature of a fast PTSC prototype with a
   percentage error of around 0.48\%.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships and character evolution in Yucca (Agavoideae,

Journal = {PHYTOTAXA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {687},
Number = {2},
Pages = {176-200},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {The current classification of Yucca (Asparagaceae, Agavoideae) is based
   on morphological characters, mainly on fruit type, caulescence, leaf
   margin and inflorescence type. To investigate the evolution of these
   characters, and their potential taxonomic significance as synapomorphies
   for some groups within Yucca, a phylogenetic analysis was performed with
   44 Yucca and eight outgroup species. Divergence times were estimated to
   produce a suitable phylogenetic framework for the investigation of
   morphological character evolution. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   inference analyses showed closer phylogenetic relationship between
   Hesperoyucca and Hesperaloe than either of these two genera with Yucca.
   The series previously proposed within the genus were not recovered as
   monophyletic, but based on fruit type we recovered two main clades which
   we name here clade Aloifolia and clade Rupicola. The ages of the Yucca
   stem and crown groups were estimated at 14.34 (95\% HPD: 14.64-14.2) and
   7.45 (95\% HPD: 11.31-3.48) million years, respectively. More recent
   diversification events occurred in both the species with fleshy and dry
   fruits. Yucca is monophyletic with two main clades, corresponding to the
   species with dry fruit (clade Rupicola) and fleshy fruit (clade
   Aloifolia). Partial geographical concordances were observed in both
   clades. The dispersal type could be a key character in the
   diversification of the genus. Leaf margin, caulescence, and
   inflorescence type are not consistent with phylogenetic relationships.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the stochastic versions of three classical
   growth models given by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Indeed we
   use the stochastic versions of Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, and logistic
   differential equations as models. We assume that each stochastic
   differential equation (SDE) has some crucial parameters to be estimated,
   and we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate them. For
   estimating the diffusion parameter, we use the MLE for two cases and the
   quadratic variation of the data for one of the SDEs. We apply the Akaike
   information criterion (AIC) to choose the best model for the simulated
   data. We consider that the AIC is a function of the drift parameter. We
   conduct numerical experiments to validate our selection method.
   Subsequently, we also apply it to actual data. The proposed methodology
   could be applied to datasets with discrete observations, including
   highly sparse data. Indeed, we can use this method even in the extreme
   case where we have observed only one point for each path, under the
   condition that we observed a sufficient number of trajectories. For the
   last two cases, the data can be viewed as incomplete observations of a
   model with a tractable likelihood function; then, we propose a version
   of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate these
   parameters. This type of dataset typically appears in fishery, for
   instance.},

Title = {Individual particle persistence antagonizes global ordering in

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},

Abstract = {The transition from individual to collective motion plays a significant
   role in many biological processes. While the implications of different
   types of particle-particle interactions for the emergence of particular
   modes of collective motion have been well studied, it is unclear how
   particular types of individual migration patterns influence collective
   motion. Here, motivated by swarming bacteria Myxococcus xanthus, we
   investigate the combined effects of the individual pattern of migration
   and particle-particle interactions on the emergence of collective
   migration. We analyze the effects of a feature of individual pattern
   migration, the persistence of motion, on the collective properties of
   the system that emerge from interactions among individuals, particularly
   when nematic velocity alignment interaction mediates collective
   dynamics. We find, through computer simulations and mathematical
   analysis, that an initially disordered migratory state can become
   globally ordered by increasing either the particle-particle alignment
   interaction strength or the persistence of individual migration. In
   contrast, we find that persistence prevents the emergence of global
   nematic order when both persistence and nematic alignment are
   comparatively high. We conclude that behavior at the population level
   not only depends on interactions between individuals but also on their
   own intrinsic behavior.},

Abstract = {Byssosphaeria Cooke is a monophyletic genus of the family
   Melanommataceae. The genus is characterized by ascomata smaller than
   1000 mu m, globose, well-developed subiculum, with a flat ostiole, and
   yellow-orange or reddish-brown color around the ostiole. The peridium is
   composed of an external layer of irregular cells followed by an internal
   layer of thinner cells. Clavate asci have fusiform ascospores, a
   hyaline-to-brown color, with one or more septa. The genus Byssosphaeria
   is composed of 29 species: saprophytes, endophytes, and parasites of
   woody angiosperms, and they are found in wood, leaves, and other
   decaying substrates. The distribution of these species is cosmopolitan,
   and four species have been described in Mexico. This study describes,
   through morphological characteristics and the phylogenetic analysis of
   molecular markers (ITS, SSU, LSU, tef1-alpha), four new species of
   Byssosphaeria: B. bautistae, B. chrysostoma, B. neorhodomphala, and B.
   neoschiedermayriana. These species are saprophytes on wood rot and are
   distributed in mountainous mesophilic forests from the states of
   Hidalgo, Puebla, and Oaxaca. The significance of this study is in the
   diversity of this genus in Mexico since eight species have been
   described.},

Title = {Urban green spaces with high connectivity and complex vegetation promote

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urban growth often leads to land-use changes that result in biodiversity
   loss and reduced human benefits. In urban zones, green areas facilitate
   physicochemical processes (such as carbon capture, reducing
   environmental temperature and noise pollution), offer multiple benefits
   to human beings (e.g., water filtration and purification), and support
   numerous vertebrate populations, including birds. In the tropics, the
   capacity of green spaces to maintain bird populations is regulated by
   characteristics of these areas (e.g., vegetation structure) and
   environmental seasonality. In order to generate ecological knowledge to
   help conserve bird diversity in large urban settlements, this study
   aimed to (1) identify the most influential variables on the distribution
   of bird species in green areas of a tropical megacity, and (2) assess
   how bird richness varies between the dry and rainy seasons. Across two
   dry and rainy seasons between 2021 and 2022, detection records of 108
   bird species were obtained from 101 green areas. Air temperature and
   sampling time were the primary factors influencing bird detection. Bird
   occupancy and richness were higher in parks near other green areas in
   first dry and increased with tree richness during the rainy seasons.
   Floral abundance explained the occupancy and richness in the second dry
   season. In 2021, the highest richness was observed during the dry
   season, while in 2022, the highest richness was estimated during the
   rainy season. These findings highlight the importance of resource
   availability and spatial arrangement in urban green areas for bird
   diversity, offering insights for conservation and maintaining ecosystem
   benefits in urban environments.},

Title = {The use of 13C,14C and 18O of dental
   enamel to estimate the year of birth and geographic origin from Mexican
   individuals},
Journal = {RADIOCARBON},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 27},
Abstract = {In recent times, forensic science has increasingly relied on methods
   that use stable and radioactive isotope analysis to identify human
   remains. The use of 14C-AMS dating of dental enamel and dentine of an
   individual allows the estimation of the year of birth, while that of
   stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen can provide information on their
   geographical origin. Isotopic analysis of a tissue complements existing
   identification techniques, enhancing the capacity to refine, exclude,
   and affirm investigative approaches directed towards individual
   identification.The primary aim of this exploratory study is to
   amalgamate diverse isotopic methodologies conducive to the prompt and
   accurate identification of a deceased individual. In this manuscript, we
   elucidate the application of a rapid processing technique for whole
   molars from individuals with documented ages, employed to ascertain age
   through 14C-AMS dating. Furthermore, an investigation was undertaken to
   assess the capacity of carbon and oxygen-stable isotopes in
   distinguishing regional disparities. To achieve this, we conducted a
   comparative analysis of tooth samples sourced from individuals residing
   in three cities within the Mexican Republic: Mexico City in the central
   region, Oaxaca City in the southern region, and Tepic Nayarit on the
   western Pacific coast. The age of dental piece formation, as estimated
   through 14C-AMS, exhibited a precise correlation with the actual age. By
   means of the stable isotope outcomes, the data disclosed substantial
   disparities in 13C and 18O abundances among teeth from individuals
   residing in the three cities.},

   dependence of the mean transverse momenta obtained in the soft and

Title = {Insecticidal activity of a Tabernaemontana arborea root
   bark alkaloid extract against Culex quinquefasciatus
   larvae},

Abstract = {The (sub-)tropical mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera:
   Culicidae) is a major vector for various parasitic and viral zoonotic
   diseases that pose a significant threat to human health. One promising
   source of effective and environmentally sustainable botanical
   insecticides against mosquitoes is the pantropical genus Tabernaemontana
   L. (Apocynaceae), which includes approximately 100 woody species known
   for producing bioactive monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs). We
   analyzed the alkaloid profile and insecticidal properties of a total
   alkaloid extract (TAE) obtained from the root bark of Tabernaemontana
   arborea ROSE ex J.D.SM. (Apocynaceae) against C. quinquefasciatus.
   According to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), voacangine,
   ibogaine, vobasine, and coronaridine (82.99 \%, 5.33 \%, 4.62 \%, and
   1.97 \% of the TAE's dry weight, respectively) were the main
   constituents of the TAE (2.42 \% of the bark's dry weight), which
   demonstrated significant larvicidal activity (LC 50,90 = 1.56, 8.36 mu
   g/mL, 2.75, 13.42 mu g/mL, and 3.29, 13.95 mu g/mL for the second,
   third, and fourth instar, respectively). Both lethal and sublethal doses
   reduced the fecundity and vitality of the surviving mosquitoes without
   affecting the aquatic non-target species Daphnia magna Straus
   (Anomopoda: Daphniidae). Given the high yields of root bark and TAE, T.
   arborea shows promise as a source of sustainable botanical insecticides.
   It is a non-threatened species that thrives in disturbed areas across
   tropical and subtropical Mexico and can be easily propagated from seeds.
   However, further research, including laboratory and especially field
   studies, is needed to develop standardized formulations with MIAs from
   T. arborea that are effective, safe, and environmentally friendly.},

Abstract = {How do levels of government coordinate to improve road accessibility?
   This article will examine the degree of accessibility to the paved road,
   one of the indicators included in section IX of article 36 of the LGDS
   in a 2013 reform. Previous literature indicates that the accessibility
   to the paved road network must be analyzed from two dimensions: one
   geographical and one social. The argument of the article is that
   political parties -especially municipal presidents- also play an
   important role in explaining the distribution of resources at the local
   level, specifically in road infrastructure, as well as political
   participation and competition. A quantitative analysis is performed, and
   the results are consistent.},

Title = {Inga madrensis (Leguminosae, Caesalpinoideae), a new
   species from the Sierra Madre del Sur in the state of Guerrero, Mexico},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {132},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The genus Inga includes ca. 300 tree species
   distributed throughout the American tropics. During the study of the
   Leguminosae family in the state of Guerrero, specimens of Inga with
   hispid leaves, hirsute fruits, and flowers that do not correspond to any
   known species were detected. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
   describe and illustrate a new species of Inga. Methods: The specimens of
   Inga deposited in the herbarium FCME were reviewed, and some botanical
   collections in the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero were made. After
   detailed observation under a stereoscopic microscope and the use of
   specialized literature, these samples were compared to morphologically
   similar species as Inga ismaelis and Inga exalata. Their conservation
   status was assessed according to the categories and criteria of the IUCN
   Red List. Key results: Inga madrensis is described and illustrated as a
   new species. It is distinguished from I. ismaelis by its leaves with
   reddish glandular trichomes, a terete leaf rachis, a stipitate
   interfoliolar gland, spike-shaped inflorescences, shorter floral bracts,
   a shorter calyx and corolla, obtuse calyx lobes, and smaller legumes. It
   is distinguished from Inga exalata by its reddish glandular trichomes,
   leaves with a greater number of leaflets, and longer leaf rachis, floral
   bracts, and legumes. Conclusions: The description of this new taxonomic
   entity, endemic to Guerrero, enriches our knowledge of the genus Inga in
   this state, and it is a further indication of the importance of the
   cloud forest where this species occurs.},

Journal = {REVISTA BIO CIENCIAS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The study aimed to evaluate the effect of climate, measured through the
   Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature index (WBGTi), on the seminal quality of
   Quarter Horses in a horse farm located in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, in a
   tropical environment. Meteorological variables, including ambient
   temperature and relative humidity, were assessed over nine years
   (2013-2021) to determine the daily and monthly average WBGTi. These
   values were then related to the macroscopic (volume) and microscopic
   characteristics (motility percentage, vitality, normal spermatozoa, and
   sperm concentration) of semen obtained from five stallions. A thermally
   comfortable environment (WBGTi <= 26.99), falling within the
   thermoneutral zone of horses, was observed from December to February. In
   contrast, from March to October, the environment was classified as
   thermally cautious or stressful (WBGTi = 27 to 36.80). A significant
   difference (p <= 0.05) was found in the percentage of mobility (73.75
   +/- 2.58 vs 67.25 +/- 1.29 in precautionary environment and 65.99 +/-
   3.32 in stressful environment), vitality (79.62 +/- 2.22 vs 74.71 +/-
   1.10, 73.69 +/- 2.82) and normal spermatozoa (66.95 +/- 1.55 vs 62.84
   +/- 0.78, 61.51 +/- 1.99), being lower during the warmest period. Sperm
   volume and concentration were not significantly affected by the WBGTi
   increase, and none of the seminal characteristics exhibited seasonal
   patterns. It was concluded that an increase in heat, as measured by
   WBGTi, negatively impacted the seminal quality of stallions.},

Abstract = {The nitrogen (N) cycle is a familiar concept. As is the much simplified,
   often diagrammatic, representation commonly used to illustrate the
   scale, importance and interconnectedness of this global cycle that links
   air, water, rocks and living beings. However, in this representation,
   humans are often presented as a seemingly minor entity or not explicitly
   shown at all. This can obscure the idea that humanity is both a direct
   beneficiary of the nitrogen cycle (through food and resources) and an
   increasingly significant influence on its function. This study sought to
   understand how diverse Human-Nature relationships (HNR) are expressed in
   recent academic literature on the nitrogen cycle. A sample of
   peer-reviewed literature, containing explicit and inferred examples of
   HNR and the nitrogen cycle, was analysed using two approaches: 1)
   network analysis, identifying and illustrating all quantifiable links
   made between components of the nitrogen cycle, and 2) content analysis
   to understand how different kinds of terminology were being used to
   describe relationships between components in the cycle. The network
   analysis revealed diverse links between `human' and `non-human nature'.
   The content analysis found some explicit use of relational terms, most
   commonly `depend{*}'. Both approaches highlighted strongly reciprocal
   links within the `human' realm and the explicit centrality in which this
   is held across the corpus. We demonstrate the utility of combining
   quantitative and qualitative analysis to understand nuanced
   relationships in the nitrogen cycle and explore the utility this has to
   increase the acknowledgement and appreciation of HNR in science
   communication and science-policy interface work.
   A network analysis of nitrogen flows empirically quantified in the
   scientific literature showed a prominence of human components in the
   nitrogen cycle and how they are connected to different atmospheric,
   aquatic and terrestrial non-human components.A qualitative content
   analysis of the same scientific literature also showed the prominent
   role of human activities within the nitrogen cycle, while revealing a
   wide acknowledgement of relationships between humans and non-human
   nature.Integrated knowledge on the strength and nature of those
   relationships is still needed to better inform policy.Our mixed approach
   can be applied for other biogeochemical cycles that are key for global
   ecosystem functioning.},

Abstract = {The current accelerated expansion of the Universe remains one of the
   most intriguing topics in modern cosmology, driving the search for
   innovative statistical techniques. Recent advancements in machine
   learning have significantly enhanced its application across various
   scientific fields, including physics, and particularly cosmology, where
   data analysis plays a crucial role in problem-solving. In this work, a
   non-parametric regression method with Gaussian processes is presented
   along with several applications to reconstruct some cosmological
   observables, such as the deceleration parameter and the dark energy
   equation of state, in order to contribute some information that helps to
   clarify the behavior of the Universe. It was found that the results are
   consistent with lambda CDM and the predicted value of the Hubble
   parameter at redshift zero is H0=68.798 +/- 6.340(1 sigma)kms-1Mpc-1.},

Title = {Modeling water availability under climate change scenarios: a systemic
   approach in the metropolitan area in Morelos, México},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {The research investigates integrated water management with complex
   socio-environmental interactions in worsening climate change scenarios.
   The proposed methodology involves the integration of Atmosphere-Ocean
   General Circulation Models (AOGCM) with Water Evaluation and Planning
   models (WEAP) to ensure water availability in the future. Two Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) integrate environmental, socioeconomic, and
   political elements under climate change scenarios with greater rainfall
   variability, extreme droughts, and floods in the metropolitan area of
   Morelos, located in the Center of M \& eacute;xico. Water availability
   in this region, along with population growth, industrialization, service
   activities, and agriculture, depends on forest conservation in the
   Ravines System of Northwest Morelos (RSNM). Public policy lacks
   interdisciplinary socio-environmental development, which prioritizes
   unsustainable economic growth overexploiting aquifers and polluting
   rivers. Official data from national and state governments do not reflect
   water conditions, and aquifer statistics date back decades. The majority
   of the analyzed models predict a delay in the monsoon, higher
   temperatures, extreme climate events, depletion of groundwater, and
   severe water scarcity during the hot months, rendering them unable to
   meet the increasing demand. This research provides valuable insights
   into the complex socioeconomic dynamics of a region with future water
   scarcity, which could be useful for similar conditions in the Global
   South.},

Abstract = {Many attempts have been made to characterise and solve the infamous
   measurement problem of quantum mechanics by advocating, implicitly or
   explicitly, different realist perspectives. As a result, we are still
   uncertain where this problem and its corresponding solution are to be
   located in the realism-antirealism debate. On the basis of a well-known
   characterisation of scientific realism ,this paper intends to fill this
   gap by arguing that the quantum description of the processes involved in
   typical measurements is problematic from the standpoint of semantic
   realism, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
   fully-fledged scientificc realism.},

Abstract = {Within the genus Quercus there are species with a shrubby habit that
   have been little studied worldwide. In Mexico, several shrub species
   within section Quercus are taxonomically highly problematic. These
   include eight named taxa that share traits such as abaxially tomentose
   leaves and growth of stems from one or multiple rhizomes, and there is
   evidence of additional undescribed species. Here, Quercus purhepecha is
   described and illustrated as a new tomentose shrubby white oak species,
   with a very restricted distribution within the Cuitzeo basin in the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), Michoac \& aacute;n state, Mexico.
   This new species is morphologically compared with Q. frutex, Q.
   microphylla and Q. repanda, which are similar taxa also distributed in
   the TMVB. In addition, a potential distribution model of Q. purhepecha
   for the Cuitzeo basin is presented.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Meteorological Optical Range (MOR) is a measurement of atmospheric
   visibility. Visibility impairment has been linked to increased aerosol
   levels in the air. This study conducted statistical analyses using
   meteorological, air pollutant concentration, and MOR data collected in
   Mexico City from August 2014 to December 2015 to determine the factors
   contributing to haze occurrence (periods when MOR < 10,000 m), defined
   using a light scatter sensor (PWS100). The outcomes revealed seasonal
   patterns in PM2.5 and relative humidity (RH) for haze occurrence along
   the year. PM2.5 levels during hazy periods in the dry season were higher
   compared to the wet season, aligning with periods of poor air quality
   (PM2.5 > 45 mu g/m3). Pollutant-to-CO ratios suggested that secondary
   aerosols' production, led by SO2 conversion to sulfate particles, mainly
   impacts haze occurrence during the dry season. Meanwhile, during the
   rainy season, the PWS100 registered haze events even with PM2.5 values
   close to 15 mu g/m3 (considered good air quality). The broadened
   distribution of extinction efficiency during the wet period and its
   correlation with RH suggest that aerosol water vapor uptake
   significantly impacts visibility during this season. Therefore,
   attributing poor visibility strictly to poor air quality may not be
   appropriate for all times and locations.},

Abstract = {Amphibian survival is imperiled by increasing anthropogenic disturbance
   and insufficient conservation efforts. Spatial prioritization is an
   essential tool that allows for optimization of scarce conservation
   resources and the identification of protected area networks that will
   maintain their effectiveness in the future. This study focuses on
   amphibians in the Sierra Madre del Sur, a Mexican biogeographic province
   with high amphibian species richness and endemism. We aim to (i) assess
   the performance of the current protected area network and (ii) identify
   potential expansion areas of the current network, considering their
   persistence in time. Using occurrence data of 107 species, we estimated
   distributions with species distribution models and buffers. Species were
   weighted according to their national and international conservation
   status, and future land-use change scenarios were incorporated to
   identify priority areas using Zonation software. Results revealed poor
   performance of the current protected areas network for amphibian
   conservation, failing to cover any of the top 2\% of amphibian priority
   areas. Many protected areas fall outside the top 30\% priority,
   indicating inadequate location of protected areas for amphibian
   conservation. However, minimal network expansions could significantly
   enhance protection for high-risk species, particularly for the
   Plethodontidae family. Our study highlights the potential of systematic
   conservation planning in improving efficient amphibian conservation,
   even with minimal expansions of key areas. Finally, our findings provide
   important insights into amphibian conservation in a region with high
   levels of endemism that has often been neglected in terms of
   biodiversity conservation efforts.
   La supervivencia de los anfibios est \& aacute; en peligro debido a las
   crecientes perturbaciones antropog \& eacute;nicas y los insuficientes
   esfuerzos de conservaci \& oacute;n. La priorizaci \& oacute;n espacial
   es una herramienta esencial que nos permite optimizar los escasos
   recursos para la conservaci \& oacute;n y asimismo, ayuda identificar
   redes de \& aacute;reas protegidas que podr \& iacute;an mantener su
   efectividad en el futuro. Este estudio se enfoca en anfibios de la
   Sierra Madre del Sur, una provincia biogeogr \& aacute;fica mexicana con
   alta riqueza y endemismo de especies de anfibios. Nuestros objetivos
   fueron: (i) evaluar el desempe \& ntilde;o de la red actual de \&
   aacute;reas protegidas, e (ii) identificar \& aacute;reas potenciales de
   expansi \& oacute;n de la red actual, considerando su persistencia en el
   tiempo. Utilizamos datos de ocurrencia de 107 especies para estimar
   distribuciones con Modelos de Distribuci \& oacute;n de Especies y zonas
   de amortiguamiento. Las especies se ponderaron seg \& uacute;n su
   estatus de conservaci \& oacute;n nacional e internacional, y se
   incorporaron escenarios futuros de cambio de uso del suelo para
   identificar \& aacute;reas prioritarias utilizando el software Zonation.
   Los resultados revelaron un pobre desempe \& ntilde;o de la red de \&
   aacute;reas protegidas para la conservaci \& oacute;n de anfibios,
   cubriendo el 0\% del 2\% de \& aacute;reas prioritarias para anfibios.
   Muchas \& aacute;reas protegidas quedan fuera del 30\% de prioridad m \&
   aacute;xima, lo que indica una ubicaci \& oacute;n inadecuada de \&
   aacute;reas protegidas para la conservaci \& oacute;n de anfibios. Sin
   embargo, ampliaciones m \& iacute;nimas de la red podr \& iacute;an
   mejorar significativamente la protecci \& oacute;n de las especies de
   alto riesgo y, en particular, de la familia Plethodontidae. Nuestro
   estudio destaca el potencial de la Planificaci \& oacute;n Sistem \&
   aacute;tica de la Conservaci \& oacute;n para mejorar eficientemente la
   conservaci \& oacute;n de los anfibios, incluso con expansiones m \&
   iacute;nimas de \& aacute;reas clave. Finalmente, nuestros hallazgos
   brindan informaci \& oacute;n importante para la conservaci \& oacute;n
   de anfibios en una regi \& oacute;n con altos niveles de endemismo que a
   menudo ha sido descuidada en t \& eacute;rminos de esfuerzos de
   conservaci \& oacute;n de la biodiversidad.},

Title = {Proposed mechanisms of action participating in the hypoglycemic effect
   of the traditionally used Croton guatemalensis Lotsy and junceic
   acid, its main compound},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Croton guatemalensis Lotsy (Euphorbiaceae) is an important traditional
   medicine that is used by the Cakchiquels of Guatemala to control
   hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have
   shown that administration of this plant induces an acute hypoglycemic
   effect during fasting and that the main compound is junceic acid, a
   diterpenoid with a clerodane skeleton; however, junceic acid has not
   been reported to have hypoglycemic activity in the literature. As the
   mechanisms involved in the hypoglycemic effect of C. guatemalensis
   remain unknown, the objective of the present investigation was to
   elucidate the hypoglycemic mechanisms of this species, as well as its
   major compound, junceic acid. The results indicated that, similar to
   complete extract, junceic acid exhibited a hypoglycemic effect in
   hyperglycemic rats. Both C. guatemalensis extract and junceic acid
   inhibited the activity of two rate-limiting enzymes involved in hepatic
   glucose production; however, compared with chlorogenic acid, junceic
   acid had a more potent effect on glucose-6-phosphatase levels than
   chlorogenic acid, which was used as a positive control. Furthermore,
   both fasting and postprandial insulin levels decreased in healthy and
   hyperglycemic rats despite reduced blood glucose levels in both
   metabolic states, suggesting a potential insulin-sensitizing effect.
   However, neither of these compounds potentiated the effect of insulin in
   insulin tolerance tests nor inhibited the enzyme activity of protein
   tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a negative regulator of the insulin pathway.
   Therefore, the insulin-sensitizing effect is thought to be independent
   of insulin and mediated by potential activation of the AMP-activated
   protein kinase pathway. The specific activation of this master regulator
   in beta-cells results in the inhibition of insulin secretion in a
   healthy state and the restoration of the insulin response under
   conditions of glucotoxicity; these effects were observed after the
   administration of the extract and junceic acid in healthy and
   hyperglycemic rats. Overall, the main findings of this study establish a
   basis of the mechanisms of action of C. guatemalensis and its main
   compound, junceic acid, in terms of their hypoglycemic effect.},

Abstract = {Intertidal macroalgae provide food and shelter for different organisms.
   The objective of this work was to analyze the bivalves associated with
   macroalgae. Sampling was carried out in January, May, July, and November
   2014, 72 samples of macroalgae and their associated bivalves were
   manually collected within 400 cm(2) in 2 locations in Guerrero: El
   Palmar and Las Gatas beaches. The community structure of bivalves was
   determined from specific richness, composition, abundance, distribution,
   and community indices: Shannon diversity, Pielou evenness and Simpson
   dominance. Each macroalgal species (59 spp.) was associated with
   proposed morphofunctional groups. Macroalgal cover, bivalve abundance
   and retained sediment were analyzed. Of the total number of individuals
   (873), 17 bivalve species were recognized. The Shannon index was 2.15
   bits/individual. Bivalves were associated with 3 morphofunctional groups
   of macroalgae. Bivalve abundance and retained sediment decreased by
   month, while abundance, cover, and sediment decreased with increasing
   tide level. Studies like this provide important information for
   understanding coastal diversity, in this case of a tourist area in
   Guerrero.},

Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},

Abstract = {The respiratory activities of mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV were
   analyzed in permeabilized Rhodotorula mucilaginosa cells and isolated
   mitochondria, and the kinetic parameters K0.5 and Vmax were obtained. No
   difference in substrate affinities were found between mitochondria and
   permeabilized cells. The activities of the components of the
   mitochondrial respiratory chain of the Antarctic yeast R. mucilaginosa
   M94C9 were identified by in-gel activity and SDS-PAGE. The mitochondria
   exhibited activity for the classical components of the electron
   transport chain (Complexes I, II, III, and IV), and supercomplexes were
   formed by a combination of the respiratory complexes I, III, and IV.
   Unfortunately, the activities of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the
   F1F0-ATP synthase were not revealed by the in-gel assay, but the two
   forms of the ATP synthase were visualized in the SDS-PAGE. Furthermore,
   two alternative pathways for the oxidation of cytosolic NADH were
   identified: the alternative NADH dehydrogenase and the
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In addition, an NADPH dehydrogenase
   and a lactate cytochrome b2 dehydrogenase were found. The residual
   respiratory activity following cyanide addition suggests the presence of
   an alternative oxidase in cells.},

Title = {Keystone species in an urban environment: Do raptors control the Mexican
   gray squirrel in Mexico City?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization has forced animals to respond to novel environments. One of
   the basic questions in urban ecology is if ecological processes that
   occur in natural conditions also occur in urban environments. In natural
   ecosystems, key predators can limit prey abundance and have a widespread
   effect on trophic levels. Here, we examine a predator-prey interaction
   in Mexico City, an urban ecosystem where prey can be evaluated in the
   presence or absence of apex predators. Nearly all original ecosystems in
   Mexico City have been transformed for human purposes. Many of the green
   spaces in the city contain populations of the Mexican gray squirrel, a
   species native to this area. These green spaces are also inhabited by
   different species of raptors, the most frequent being Harris's hawk,
   Cooper's hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. Little is known about the
   interactions between raptors and squirrels, particularly how different
   environmental factors influence this ecological relationship. We do
   know, however, that raptors prey on squirrels. We predicted that in
   parks where raptors were present, there would be fewer squirrels than in
   parks where there were no raptors. We studied the relationship between
   raptors and squirrels using occupancy models, which also allowed us to
   evaluate environmental factors that affect the presence of both
   squirrels and raptors. We also tested if the presence of raptors
   influenced the occupancy probability of squirrels, and vice versa.
   Lastly, we estimated the abundance of squirrels in parks, both where
   raptors were present and where they were absent. Contrary to our
   predictions, in our first two sampling periods we found a positive
   relationship between the presence of raptors and squirrel abundance, but
   this relationship was absent during our second two survey periods, which
   was due to a decline in squirrel abundance in parks where raptors were
   present. These results suggest that predator-prey interactions occur in
   urban settings much as they do under natural conditions, but that other
   factors unique to urbanization can also impact the abundance of raptors
   and squirrels. Our findings also suggest that raptors might be an
   effective means of controlling squirrel populations under some
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Urban noise can potentially disturb the acoustic signals of animals

   (Eleutherodactylus nitidus) in the metropolitan area of Puebla, Mexico.
   We recorded and analyzed 672 advertisement calls from 28 male frogs and
   the corresponding environmental noises from three distinct localities.
   Our analysis focused on four acoustic properties of the calls:
   inter-call interval, call duration, dominant frequency, and call
   amplitude. To standardize the amplitude measurements of sound pressure
   levels produced by noise and frog calls, we employed a practical
   approach using a reference signal for calibration. We treated the
   longitudinal data of different noises occurring before, during, and
   after advertisement calls as repeated measures within the urban
   locations. During our samplings, frogs called amidst spontaneous urban
   noises, including dog barking, fireworks, and vehicle engine sounds. Our
   results indicate that vehicle engine sounds and dog barking do not cause
   significant distortions in the calls of these urban frogs. However, we
   observed slight variations in the dominant frequency of calls,
   decreasing by 11 Hz, during and after fireworks. Given the observed
   plasticity of E. nitidus in response to noise, urban noises may not pose
   a severe problem for this urban frog.},

Abstract = {We study energy-momentum and charge transport in strongly interacting
   holographic quantum field theories in an anisotropic thermal state by
   contrasting three different holographic methods to compute transport
   coefficients: standard holographic calculation of retarded Green's
   functions, a method based on the null-focusing equation near horizon and
   the novel method based on background variations. Employing these methods
   we compute anisotropic shear and bulk viscosities and conductivities
   with anisotropy induced externally, for example by an external magnetic
   field. We show that all three methods yield consistent results. The
   novel method allows us to read off the transport coefficients from the
   horizon data and express them in analytic form from which we derive
   universal relations among them. Furthermore we extend the method based
   on the null-focusing equation to Gauss-Bonnet theory to compute higher
   derivative corrections to the aforementioned transport coefficients.},

   Complexity},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study practical approximations of Kolmogorov prefix complexity (K)
   using IMP2, a high-level programming language. Our focus is on
   investigating the optimality of the interpreter for this language as the
   reference machine for the Coding Theorem Method (CTM). This method is
   designed to address applications of algorithmic complexity that differ
   from the popular traditional lossless compression approach based on the
   principles of algorithmic probability. The chosen model of computation
   is proven to be suitable for this task, and a comparison to other models
   and methods is conducted. Our findings show that CTM approximations
   using our model do not always correlate with the results from
   lower-level models of computation. This suggests that some models may
   require a larger program space to converge to Levin's universal
   distribution. Furthermore, we compare the CTM with an upper bound on
   Kolmogorov complexity and find a strong correlation, supporting the
   CTM's validity as an approximation method with finer-grade resolution of
   K.},

Title = {Purinergic Signaling in Non-Parenchymal Liver Cells},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purinergic signaling has emerged as an important paracrine-autocrine
   intercellular system that regulates physiological and pathological
   processes in practically all organs of the body. Although this system
   has been thoroughly defined since the nineties, recent research has made
   substantial advances regarding its role in aspects of liver physiology.
   However, most studies have mainly targeted the entire organ, 70\% of
   which is made up of parenchymal cells or hepatocytes. Because of its
   physiological role, the liver is exposed to toxic metabolites, such as
   xenobiotics, drugs, and fatty acids, as well as to pathogens such as
   viruses and bacteria. Under injury conditions, all cell types within the
   liver undergo adaptive changes. In this context, the concentration of
   extracellular ATP has the potential to increase dramatically. Indeed,
   this purinergic response has not been studied in sufficient detail in
   non-parenchymal liver cells. In the present review, we systematize the
   physiopathological adaptations related to the purinergic system in
   chronic liver diseases of non-parenchymal liver cells, such as hepatic
   stellate cells, Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and
   cholangiocytes. The role played by non-parenchymal liver cells in these
   circumstances will undoubtedly be strategic in understanding the
   regenerative activities that support the viability of this organ under
   stressful conditions.},

Title = {Superconductivity in Twisted Bismuth Bilayers},
Journal = {ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Two twisted bismuth bilayers, TBB, each with 120 atoms, are studied
   using their electron density of states and their vibrational density of
   states using first-principles calculations. Metallic character at the
   Fermi level is found for the non-rotated sample as well as for each
   sample rotated 0.5 degrees, 1.0 degrees, 1.5 degrees, 2.0 degrees, 2.5
   degrees, 3.0 degrees, 4.0 degrees, 5.0 degrees, 6.0 degrees, 7.0
   degrees, 8.0 degrees, and 10 degrees with respect to each other.
   Assuming that the superconductivity is BCS-type and the invariance of
   the Cooper pairing potential, a maximum superconducting temperature TC
   approximate to 1.8 K is predicted for a magic angle of 0.5 degrees
   between the two bilayers, increasing the superconducting transition
   temperature from the experimentally measured value of 0.53 mK for the
   Wyckoff structure of crystalline bismuth.
   This work uses first principles calculations to analyze the electronic
   and vibrational properties of two twisted bismuth bilayers (TBB).
   Metallic characteristics are found across various rotation angles and
   predicts a superconducting temperature peak at 1.76 K for a 0.5 degrees
   magic angle, significantly enhancing the known superconductivity of
   bismuth. image},

Abstract = {In a previous work, (dual)-m-Rickart lattices were studied. Now, in this
   paper, we introducem-endoregular lattices as those lattices L such that
   m is a regular monoid, where m is a submonoid with zero of End(lin)(L).
   We show that these lattices can be characterized in terms of m-Rickart
   and dual-m-Rickart lattices. Also, we compare these new lattices with
   those lattices in which every compact element is a complement. We
   characterize the m-endoregular lattices such that every idempotent in m
   is central in m and we show that for these lattices the complements are
   a sublattice which is a Boolean algebra. We introduce two new concepts,
   m-K-extending and m-T-lifting lattices. For these lattices, we show that
   the monoid m has a regular quotient monoid provided they satisfy m-C-2
   and m-D-2 respectively. At the end, some applications to quotients
   categories of R-Mod are given.},

Abstract = {The validity of using an effective-medium approach (EMA) to model the
   reflectivity of a disordered monolayer of particles that scatter light
   significantly is tested experimentally. To achieve this, we measured the
   optical reflectivity versus the angle of incidence in an internal
   reflection configuration of a disordered monolayer of polymeric
   particles with negligible optical absorption and a diameter of about
   half a wavelength (size parameter of 1.2) deposited on a glass-air
   interface. We found a clear effective-medium film equivalence, even for
   low particle densities and for angles of incidence well beyond the
   critical angle, where light penetrates the monolayer less than a
   particle diameter. (c) 2024 are reserved.},

Title = {Monitoring drift and associated biodiversity of nearshore rafts of
   holopelagic Sargassum spp. in the Mexican Caribbean},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {195},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent recurrent inundations of holopelagic Sargassum species (sargasso)
   in the tropical North Atlantic warrant studies to increase our
   understanding of this phenomenon. We carried out a multidisciplinary
   study to determine the drift and associated biota of sargasso rafts in
   nearshore waters of a reef system in the Mexican Caribbean, during the
   2020-2022 influx seasons. Home-designed trackable drifting buoys
   revealed notorious influence of winds stronger than 4-5 m s(-1) on the
   rafts' displacement. At lower wind velocities, the drift was almost
   entirely determined by currents; local topography played a role in
   concentrating or dispersing the algae. Video cameras attached to the
   drifting buoys allowed for non-invasive identification of free-swimming
   ichthyofauna, recording low specific richness with a dominance of
   species of the Carangidae family. Sargasso associated biota was sampled
   with a dipnet. The small motile macrofauna was abundant and diverse,
   with a dominance of few species. Epibionts (epifauna and epiphytic
   algae) showed low specific diversity, while the microbial communities
   were dominated by (potentially pathogenic) Vibro spp. Small motile
   macrofauna was the only biota group with new records for the study
   region. Differences among sampling events were observed in the
   associated community; suggesting large inherent variability of the
   rafts' biota. The information on wind, coastal hydrodynamics and
   topography on the displacement of the sargasso rafts will allow for
   better predictions of strandings, and information on associated
   non-native biota or dominant microbial species helped identify groups
   that should be closely monitored; thereby aiding in targeted management
   actions for mitigating the impacts of the inundations.},

Title = {What do we know about the demographic modeling of cacti? A systematic
   review of current knowledge},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {224},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cacti are threatened mainly by loss of habitat and illegal commerce.
   Because of this, it is essential to know their demographic
   characteristics. We systematically reviewed the publications with matrix
   population models (MPM) and integral projection models (IPM) in indexed
   journals, databases like the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and grey
   literature. In each publication, we recorded the literature
   characteristics, the population attributes, and the methods and metrics
   applied to describe them. We reviewed studies published until April
   2022. We found 83 publications applied demographic modeling, 43 of which
   were of grey literature. Most studies were conducted in North America
   and on the tribe Cacteae, with a scarce representation of South American
   cactus. Compared to a previous review from 20 years ago, our study
   recorded a 488\% increase in the number of publications and a 33.3\%
   increase in the COMPADRE demographic database. We found demographic data
   for 65 taxa and very few studies covered a medium-to long-term period.
   MPMs were the most used until the 2009 when IPMs began to gain
   popularity. Population growth rates were commonly close to the unit
   (lambda approximate to 1), but we identified a wide range of lambda
   values. Species position in the demographic triangle showed that the
   populations in the tribes Echinocereae, Cereeae and Cylindropuntieae
   were located towards the end of the survival axis, while those in the
   tribes Cacteae, and Opuntieae had a more variable location. Applications
   of demographic models have focused on the analysis of life history
   traits (growth and turnover) and employing numerical simulations to
   simulate the consequences of variations in vital rates on lambda.
   Interactions with the climate and the nurse-protected system are
   analyzed frequently. Nonetheless, a limited number of research explores
   the socioeconomic and political components of management and
   conservation. Finally, even though Cactaceae is the plant group with the
   most extensive demographic research, models are available for only 3.5\%
   of the species.},

   unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase
   space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase
   space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the
   multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we
   use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space
   known as Lagrangian descriptors in the literature.},

Title = {Hormonal dynamics of matrotrophy vs. lecithotrophy in live-bearing fish
   reproduction},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR \& INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {296},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We explored the relationship between gestational states, fecundity, and
   steroid hormone levels in three species of live-bearing fish with
   different maternal provisioning strategies. We studied two
   lecithotrophic species, Gambusia affinis and Xiphophorus couchianus,
   where embryos feed exclusively on yolk stored in the eggs, and one
   matrotrophic species, Heterandria formosa, which actively transfers
   nutrients to embryos through a follicular placenta. We measured
   water-borne cortisol, estradiol, and progesterone along with brood size
   (fecundity) and gestational stage(s). We examined the physiological
   costs of both maternal provisioning modes. Matrotrophy likely imposes
   energetic demands due to active nutrient transfer, while lecithotrophy
   may incur costs from carrying many large embryos. We hypothesized that
   fecundity, gestational stage, and hormones would covary differently in
   lecithotrophic vs. matrotrophic species. We found no relationships
   between hormones and fecundity or gestational stage in any species.
   However, in H. formosa, we found a positive relationship between
   estradiol levels and female mass, and a negative relationship between
   progesterone levels and female mass indicating a change in the
   circulating levels of both hormones as females grow. We observed
   differences in average hormone levels among species: the matrotrophic
   species had higher progesterone and lower estradiol compared to
   lecithotrophic species. Higher estradiol in lecithotrophic species may
   relate to egg yolk formation, while placental structures could play a
   role in progesterone production in matrotrophic species. Elevated
   cortisol in H. formosa suggests either higher energetic costs or a
   preparative role for reproduction. Our findings highlight progesterone's
   importance in maintaining gestation in matrotrophic species, like other
   placental species.},

Title = {Genetic analyses and dispersal patterns unveil the Amazonian origin of

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is a semi-domesticated fruit tree of moderate
   importance in the Neotropics, utilized for millennia due to its
   nutritional and medicinal benefits, but its origin of domestication
   remains unknown. In this study, we examine genetic diversity and
   population structure in 215 plants from 11 countries in Mesoamerica, the
   Andes, and Amazonia using 25 nuclear microsatellite loci to propose an
   origin of domestication. Genetic analyses reveal one gene pool in
   Mesoamerica (Mexico) and four in South America (Brazilian Amazonia,
   Peruvian Amazonia and Andes, and Colombia), indicating greater
   differentiation among localities, possibly due to isolation between
   guava populations, particularly in the Amazonian and Andean regions.
   Moreover, Mesoamerican populations show high genetic diversity, with
   moderate genetic structure due to gene flow from northern South American
   populations. Dispersal scenarios suggest that Brazilian Amazonia is the
   probable origin of guava domestication, spreading from there to the
   Peruvian Andes, northern South America, Central America, and Mexico.
   These findings present the first evidence of guava domestication in the
   Americas, contributing to a deeper understanding of its evolutionary
   history.},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Given a set F of oriented graphs, a graph G is a Forb e (F) -graph if it
   admits an F -free orientation. Skrien showed that proper -circular arc
   graphs, nested interval graphs and comparability graphs, correspond to
   Forb e (F) -graph classes for some set F of orientations of P 3 .
   Building on these results, we exhibit the list of all Forb e (F) -graph
   classes when F is a set of oriented graphs on three vertices. Structural
   characterizations for these classes are provided, except for the
   so-called perfectly-orientable graphs and the
   transitive-perfectly-orientable graphs, which remain as open problems.},

Title = {Epibiotic ciliate communities on the crayfish Procambarus
   (Austrocambarus) sp. cultivated in a rustic aquaculture in southern
   Mexico},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Rustic aquaculture systems represent a sustainable production
   alternative in the world, providing appropriate conditions for the
   establishment of epibiotic ciliates on crayfish. However, the impact of
   epibiotic ciliates on the aquaculture production has been insufficiently
   studied hitherto. The objective of this work was to identify the
   epibiotic ciliates on the surface of the crayfish Procambarus
   (Austrocambarus) sp. and analyze whether there is any correlation
   between seasonality and environmental conditions in an artificial pond
   in Chiapas, Mexico. The crayfish were collected during dry and rainy
   seasons to investigate their ciliate epibionts. Some physical and
   chemical parameters of the sampled water were measured and correlation
   matrix analyses were applied to detect possible relationships between
   the presence of ciliates and environmental parameters. Thirteen species
   belonging to the subclasses Peritrichia and Suctoria were identified.
   Significant differences were found for some environmental parameters and
   species recorded in both seasons. The present data could help to better
   understand the relationship bewteen the epibiotic ciliate community on
   crayfish and some environmental parameters in aquaculture systems.},

Abstract = {K X-ray production cross sections of Co, Ni, and Zn due to the impact of
   2.48 MeV to 3.84 MeV 12C3+ and 13C3+ ions were experimentally determined
   using the thick target approach. It was possible to observe differences
   in the cross sections due to the distinct mass of the ions. A reduced
   variable v1/v2K, where v1 is the ion velocity and v2K is the (Bohr)
   electron orbital velocity, was considered to scale the ion energies.
   When the data were plotted as a function of the reduced variable, a
   single curve was obtained for all targets and both isotopes. Comparisons
   with several models were also made, including corrections due to
   electron capture and multiple ionization. It was found that the
   adiabatic perturbation with molecular orbitals formation, plus electron
   capture and multiple ionization corrections, is the theory that better
   describes the experimental results.},

Title = {Knowledge shortfalls and the effect of wildfires on biodiversity
   conservation in Guanajuato, Mexico},
Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Knowledge of shortfalls could modify the geographic distribution
   patterns and limit the actions to conserve the biodiversity, even in the
   taxa best known. In addition, forest fires also could modify those
   patterns, but the potential effects of both factors have not been
   tested. Our aim was to analyze the effect of the Linnean and Wallacean
   shortfalls in the first evaluation of wildfire impacts on 22 amphibian
   and 13 mammal species distributed in Guanajuato, Mexico. We evaluated
   those shortfalls using the non-parametric estimator Chao2 and the Qs
   estimator and through maps of species richness patterns. To evaluate the
   effects of wildfires, we produced a fire recurrence map and quantified
   the burned area within species distributions and in 24 Protected Natural
   Areas (PNA) in the state. The Linnean shortfall showed some species

Title = {Chorotypes and geographic relationships among endemic species of the
   Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Mexico},
Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TVB) is a complex biogeographical
   province characterized by several areas of endemism and high diversity
   of flora and fauna produced by complex geological and evolutionary
   processes. Chorotypes are biogeographical patterns that occur either
   when 2 or more independently distributed species share the same occupied
   area, or even when a single species' distribution area differs
   significantly from others. Here, we identified chorotypes of 167 endemic
   species inhabiting the TVB using geographic distribution models and
   quantitative methods. Of those species, 136 were included in 11
   chorotypes, named I to XI. In addition, the insect Aedes niveoscotum
   constituted chorotype XII. The 30 remaining species did not belong to
   any chorotype. All chorotypes included species from different taxonomic
   groups, which may be due to a shared biogeographical history. The
   chorotypes with the highest richness were located in the central and
   eastern TVB, suggesting that volcano peaks and surrounding areas are
   important for generating the particular environmental conditions that
   restrict the distribution of species of different taxonomic groups.},

Title = {m-Periodic Gorenstein objects (vol 621, pg 1, 2023)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {654},
Pages = {70-81},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Let (A, B) be a GP-admissible pair and (Z, W) be a GIadmissible pair of
   classes of objects in an abelian category C, and consider the class pi
   GP((omega,B,1)) of 1-periodic (omega, B)-Gorenstein projective objects,
   where.:= A boolean AND B and v:= Z boolean AND W. We claimed in {[}9,
   Lem. 8.1] that the (Z, W)-Gorenstein injective dimension of pi
   GP((omega,B,1)) is bounded by the (Z, W)-Gorenstein injective dimension
   of., provided that: (1).is closed under direct summands, (2) Ext1(pi
   GP((omega,B,1)) , v) = 0, and (3) every object in pi GP((omega,B,1))
   admits a Hom(-,v)-acyclic v-coresolution. These conditions and their
   duals are part of what we called ``Setup 1{''}. Moreover, if we replace
   pi GP((omega,B,1)) by the class GP((A,B)) of (A, B)-Gorenstein
   projective objects, the resulting inequality is claimed to be true under
   a set of conditions named ``Setup 2{''}. The proof we gave for the
   claims Gid( Z,W)(pi GP((omega,B,1))) <= Gid((Z,W))(omega) and
   Gid((Z,W))(GP((A,B))) <= Gid((Z,W))(omega) is incorrect, and the purpose
   of this note is to exhibit a corrected proof of the first inequality,
   under the additional assumption that every object in pi GP((omega,B,1))
   has finite injective dimension relative to Z. Setup 2 is no longer
   required, and as a result the second inequality was removed. We also fix
   those results in 8 of {[}9] affected by Lemma 8.1, and comment some
   applications and examples. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Anthropophony is a prominent component of soundscapes worldwide and is
   known to impact biota. While responses to anthropophony in terrestrial
   and marine animals have been relatively well-studied, there is still a
   lack of knowledge regarding freshwater animals. In fact, freshwater taxa
   are among the possibly most threatened groups, and unveiling the reasons
   for their threat is crucial. We investigated the effect of low-frequency
   sounds -usually associated with anthropophony- on the stridulation of
   Krizousacorixa femorata, a common water bug in Mexico City. Using aerial
   recordings, we estimated the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index
   (NDSI), which is the most commonly used index to measure anthropophony,
   to characterize soundscapes in six city sites throughout the year.
   Additionally, from underwater recordings in the same sites, we obtained
   the peak frequency (Pf) of the stridulations, as it is the frequency
   with the highest energy and, therefore, the one that can travel the
   farthest and can be identified even in the presence of overlapping
   sounds. Finally, we evaluated the relationships between soundscapes and
   Pf through a mixed linear model. There was a negative correlation
   between NDSI and Pf, indicating higher-pitched stridulations at sites
   with dominant anthropophony. While we cannot rule out other factors
   contributing to stridulation variation, we remain uncertain about how
   low-frequency sounds impact freshwater ecosystems and the intricate
   relationship between soundscapes and aquatic life in urban settings.
   There is a correlation between anthropophony and variations in the
   stridulation of aquatic bugs. This highlights the possibility of sound
   pollution on freshwater systems, emphasizing the need for assessment to
   better understand and prevent potential harm to aquatic insects.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {931},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Water is a defining element for cities and their inhabitants. Throughout
   urban systems, water is either produced or received, used, and finally
   disposed of as wastewater. As Latin American urbanization accelerates,
   problems related to wastewater are increasing due to its inclusion as
   the main source of river pollution, as well as the high cost of
   infrastructure development and maintenance. The consequences of
   wastewater disposal are particularly relevant in areas frequently
   associated with urban expansion, like peripheries whose growth follows
   constant transitions between rural, peri-urban, and urban areas. Such
   consequences are often related to heterogeneity, lack of urban services
   and sanitation infrastructure, water pollution and health risks, as well
   as the development of informal compensatory systems. A systematic
   literature review was conducted to broaden research panorama and
   identify spatial, temporal, and thematic trends and challenges present
   in wastewater assessments of Latin American urban peripheries, this
   using the SALSA (search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis) protocol in
   a search through international databases Scopus and Web of Science
   Scielo, in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. In these databases,
   228 papers satisfied selection criteria and show a growing trend of
   publications about urban wastewater since 1988. Most case studies are
   from Brazil (58 \%), Mexico (14 \%), and Argentina (9 \%). Their main
   approaches are quantitative research (82 \%) in urban contexts (57 \%).
   Most studies were found to be operationalized using environmental
   geochemistry methodologies, suggesting a dominance of technical,},

Title = {Evidence of gynodioecy in Fuchsia arborescens (Onagraceae)},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {225},

Abstract = {Gynodioecy, the coexistence of hermaphrodite and female plants in the
   same population, could be an intermediate state in the evolution of the
   full separation of sexual functions (dioecy). Fuchsia arborescens has
   been reported as a hermaphrodite species, however here we demonstrate
   that it is gynodioecious in most of its range. We sampled populations of
   F. arborescens along their distribution gradient (similar to 900 km) to:
   (1) measure floral morphometry in both floral morphs (2) estimate female
   frequency and (3) evaluate seed production in both floral morphs. We
   found that F. arborescens shows floral dimorphism, mainly given by the
   length of the floral tube and anthers, which are shorter in female
   flowers and lack pollen grains in most cases (95\%). The northernmost
   population in Jalisco was completely hermaphrodite while in the others
   female frequency ranged between 35\% and 58\%. We also found that female
   plants consistently produce more mature seeds per fruit than
   hermaphrodites, supporting the resource reallocation hypothesis for
   gynodioecious species. Further studies are required on seed germination
   and seedling performance of both morphs, as well as the estimation of
   visitation rate in both floral morphs.},

Title = {Cystatin C: immunoregulation role in macrophages infected with
   Porphyromonas gingivalis},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Background. Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease, characterized
   by an exacerbated inflammatory response and a progressive loss of the
   supporting tissues of the teeth. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key
   etiologic agent in periodontitis. Cystatin C is an antimicrobial
   salivary peptide that inhibits the growth of P. gingivalis. This study
   aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of this peptide and its
   effect on cytokine production, nitric oxide (NO) release, reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) production, and programmed cell death in human
   macrophages infected with P. gingivalis.
   Methods. Monocyte-derived macrophages generated from peripheral blood
   were infected with P. gingivalis (MOI 1:10) and stimulated with cystatin
   C (2.75 mg/ml) for 24 h. The intracellular localization of P. gingivalis
   and cystatin C was determined by immunofluorescence and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). The intracellular antimicrobial activity of
   cystatin C in macrophages was assessed by counting Colony Forming Units
   (CFU). ELISA assay was performed to assess inflammatory (TNF alpha, IL-1
   beta) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. The production of
   nitrites and ROS was analyzed by Griess reaction and incubation with
   2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), respectively.
   Programmed cell death was assessed with the TUNEL assay, Annexin-V, and
   caspase activity was also determined.
   Results. Our results showed that cystatin C inhibits the extracellular
   growth of P. gingivalis. In addition, this peptide is internalized in
   the infected macrophage, decreases the intracellular bacterial load, and
   reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO. Interestingly,
   peptide treatment increased ROS production and substantially decreased
   bacterial-induced macrophage apoptosis.
   Conclusions. Cystatin C has antimicrobial and immuno-regulatory activity
   in macrophages infected with P. gingivalis. These findings highlight the
   importance of understanding the properties of cystatin C for its
   possible therapeutic use against oral infections such as periodontitis.},

Title = {Abundance and diversity patterns and environmental drivers of Peracarida
   (Arthropoda, Crustacea) macrofauna from the deep sea of the southwestern
   Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {244},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We present unique data of abundance, spatial diversity, and bathymetric
   patterns of the Peracarida communities of the economic and ecological
   important scarce studied area of the southern Gulf of Mexico. Peracarida
   macrofauna was collected from 63 sites in a large geographical area
   (92.67 degrees- 96.70 degrees W, 18.74 degrees-23.04 degrees N) with a
   wide bathymetric gradient (185-3740 m depth) of the deep-sea
   southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The samples were obtained onboard the R/V
   Justo Sierra (Universidad Nacional Aut<acute accent>onoma de Me<acute
   accent>xico, UNAM) using a Reinecktype box corer during four
   oceanographic cruises (SOGOM 1-4; 2015-2018). We examined the
   bathymetric and spatial patterns of standardized abundance (ind. m-2)
   and taxonomic diversity (Hill numbers, q = 0, 1, and 2). Abundance
   patterns were related to environmental parameters (organic matter,
   aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, bottom water temperature, dissolved
   oxygen and grain composition). We collected 684 specimens belonging to
   53 Peracarida families of 4 orders (Amphipoda, 19; Isopoda, 17;
   Tanaidacea, 13; and Cumacea, 4). The most abundant orders were Amphipoda
   and Tanaidacea, representing 36.4\% and 35.8\% of the total abundance,
   respectively, followed by Isopoda (25.1\%). Cumacea was the least
   abundant order (2.7\%). The top ten abundant families in order were
   Apseudidae, Phoxocephalidae, Caprellidae, Desmosomatidae, Nototanaidae,
   Nannoniscidae, Tanaellidae, Ischnomesidae, Podoceridae, and
   Agathotanaidae, accounting for 66\% of the total relative abundance. The
   abundance decreased with increasing depth. Highest values were recorded
   in the northwestern region of the study area and in the Campeche Bay
   salt domes zone, whereas the lowest abundance values were registered at
   the abyssal locations and in some sites located in the Coatzacoalcos and
   Campeche Canyons. The composition and structure of the peracarid
   community showed shifts related to depth. The major structural abiotic
   factors of the Peracarida community were: latitude, depth, temperature,
   and sediment aliphatic hydrocarbons. The diversity based on the three
   estimated Hill numbers consistently decreased with increasing depth. We
   recorded intermediate and low diversity values in almost the entire
   study area, except for the Campeche Bay salt domes zone and northwestern
   region, where intermediate and high diversity values were registered.},

Title = {Association between Intracellular Calcium Signaling and Tumor Recurrence
   in Human Non-Functioning Pituitary Adenomas},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (CNFPAs) are the second
   most frequent sellar tumor among studies on community-dwelling adults.
   They are characterized by the absence of hormonal hypersecretion
   syndrome, and patients present with compressive symptoms, such as a
   headache and visual field defects. Immunohistochemically, most CNFPAs
   are of gonadotrope differentiation, with only a few of them being truly
   null cell adenomas. Although these tumors express receptors for one or
   more hypothalamic releasing hormones, to what extent this has an impact
   on the biological and clinical behavior of these neoplasms remains to be
   defined. In this research, we evaluated the basal and hypothalamic
   secretagogue-stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization in 13 CNFPAs,
   trying to correlate this response to the phenotypic features of the
   patients. Our results indicate that the recurrence of a CNFPA correlates
   positively with cellular responsiveness, as measured by spontaneous
   intracellular calcium activity and the ability to respond to multiple
   hypothalamic secretagogues. We conclude that this finding may be a
   useful tool for predicting the clinicopathologic behavior of CNFPAs, by
   testing the variation of cellular responsiveness to hypothalamic
   secretagogues.},

   funnels from samples of leaf litter and soil obtained monthly, from
   September 1993 to August 1994. Fallen leaves were not removed from the
   ground for the duration of the study. Sixty-nine species were
   registered: 58 in leaf litter and 53 in soil. Collembola density varied
   from 248 to 15,889 ind m(-2) in leaf litter and 419 to 7,286 ind m(-2)
   in soil. The layer of fallen leaves exhibited the highest density,
   species richness and diversity of collembola. The edaphic variables that
   altered collembola density were organic matter content, cationic
   exchange capacity (CEC) and carbon-tonitrogen ratio. Richness was
   affected by organic matter and total nitrogen. Diversity was affected by
   pH, total nitrogen, calcium, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. The density
   of dominant species was negatively affected by phosphorus and calcium
   content, as well as CEC.},

Abstract = {Urban ecological reserves are large green areas immersed within cities
   where native and exotic species of plants and animals coexist. Here, we
   examined the environmental features that facilitate the occurrence of
   nine species of native birds in an urban ecological reserve located
   within one of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City. We also
   searched for changes in occupancy rates among the three distinct
   climatic seasons that occur in central Mexico: warm-dry, rainy, and
   cold-dry. Using data collected during four years and multi-season
   occupancy models, we found that most of our study species prefer the
   urbanized sites that surround the reserve over the core conservation
   areas. This urban affinity can be explained by the diverse vegetation
   that prevails in such urban sites, which offers a high habitat
   heterogeneity that facilitates the presence of bird species with
   distinct ecological needs. In contrast, the reserve consists of a
   relatively homogeneous xerophytic scrubland where a few species of
   shrubs and small trees are dominant. We also detected seasonal changes
   in five species, with highest occupancy during the warm-dry season of
   each year, which coincides with both their breeding season and the
   driest period of the year. This finding indicates that these birds find
   in the reserve and surrounding urban areas enough food and water during
   this limiting season as well as safe nesting sites. Our study provides
   evidence that some native birds can become urban exploiters and that the
   benefits that they obtain from urban settings are greatest during their
   breeding season.},

Abstract = {Birds are frequent hosts of the immature stages of many tick species,
   among them Amblyomma longirostre (Koch, 1844), whose larvae and nymphs
   have been reported from several families of Passeriformes. The objective
   of this study was to determine the extent to which A. longirostre
   parasitizes birds at the Centro de Investigacion y Transferencia de
   Tecnologia Forestal `El Tormento' (CITTFOR-El Tormento), Escarcega,
   Campeche, Mexico. A total of 59 birds representing 22 species were
   examined for ticks. Thirteen bird species, all Passeriformes, yielded 69
   tick specimens: 57 larvae and 12 nymphs. Nine of the 12 nymphs were
   determined morphologically as A. longirostre; the three remaining nymphs
   were identified as Amblyomma sp. Additionally, 48 partial sequences of
   the 16S rDNA gene were obtained from 41 larvae and seven nymphs. Thirty
   sequences were similar (<= 95\%) to A. longirostre, one sequence to
   Amblyomma sabanerae, and one to Amblyomma nodosum. On the other hand, 15
   sequences and one sequence showed low identity (>95\%) to A. longirostre
   and A. nodosum, respectively. Cyanocompsa parellina, Passerina caerulea,
   Xiphorhynchus flavigaster and Uropsila leucogastra represent new host
   associations for A. longirostre in the Americas. Amblyomma sabanerae
   from Habia rubica and A. nodosum from P. caerulea represent new host
   associations.},

Abstract = {In the pursuit of identifying the novel resin glycoside modulators
   glucose-6-phosphatase and alpha-glucosidase enzymes, associated with
   blood sugar regulation, methanol-soluble extracts from the flowers of
   Ipomoea murucoides (cazahuate, Nahuatl), renowned for its abundance of
   glycolipids, were employed. The methanol-soluble extracts were
   fractionated by applying the affinity-directed method with
   glucose-6-phosphatase enzymes from a rat's liver and alpha-glucosidase
   enzymes from its intestines. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic
   resonance were employed to identify the high-affinity compound as a free
   ligand following the release from the enzymatic complex. Gel permeation
   through a spin size-exclusion column allowed the separated high-affinity
   molecules to bind to glucose-6-phosphatase and alpha-glucosidase enzymes
   in solution, which led to the identification of some previously reported
   resin glycosides in the flowers of cazahuate, where a glycolipid mainly
   structurally related to murucoidin XIV was observed. In vitro studies
   demonstrated the modulating properties of resin glycosides on the
   glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme. Dynamic light scattering revealed
   conformational variations induced by resin glycosides on
   alpha-glucosidase enzyme, causing them to become more compact, akin to
   observations with the positive control, acarbose. These findings suggest
   that resin glycosides may serve as a potential source for
   phytotherapeutic agents with antihyperglycemic properties.},

Journal = {RESEARCH EVALUATION},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the research performance evolution of a scientific
   institute, from its genesis through various stages of development. The
   main aim is to obtain, and visually represent, bibliometric evidence of
   the correlation of organizational changes on the development of its
   scientific performance; particularly, structural and leadership changes.
   The study involves six bibliometric indicators to multidimensionally
   assess the evolution of the institution's performance profile. For a
   case study, we selected the Renewable Energy Institute at the National
   Autonomous University of Mexico, created 35 years ago as a small
   laboratory, then it evolved to a research center and finally to a formal
   institute, which over the last 8 years changed from the traditional
   departmental structure to a network-based structure. The evolution of
   the multidimensional performance profiles is analyzed, and graphically
   represented, using a novel artificial intelligence-based approach. We
   analyzed the performance profiles evolution yearly, using Principal
   Components Analysis, and a self-organizing neural network mapping
   technique. This approach, combining bibliometric and machine learning
   techniques, proved to be effective for the assessment of the
   institution's evolution process. The results were represented with a
   series of graphs and maps that clearly reveal the magnitude and nature
   of the performance profile evolution, as well as its correlation with
   each of the structural and leadership transitions. These exploratory
   results have provided us data and insights into the probable effects of
   these transitions on academic performance, that have been useful to
   create a dynamical model.},

Title = {Electric or gasoline: a simple model to decide when buying a new vehicle},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In this work, a simple methodology to follow the behavior of motorized
   urban vehicles, from the point of view of personal finances, is
   presented. Including the acquisition of a new vehicle, the analysis
   considers the driving distance per week, the average speed, the time
   spent at rest due to traffic conditions, the evolution of gasoline and
   electric energy prices, maintenance and services, and local taxes.
   Herein, two low-range compact vehicles were chosen and compared: one
   powered by combustion of gasoline, and the other by electric energy
   stored in batteries. Historical data and trend projections, according to
   inflation and prices evolution, are taken into consideration. The
   developed model may help to select adequately a new vehicle, according
   to the user's needs. A good choice depends strongly on the usage and
   traffic conditions, the electric vehicle being suitable for large weekly
   driving distances and heavy traffic, whereas the gasoline vehicle is
   preferred for short distances and light traffic. The expenses of the
   vehicles are compared through time, with different scenarios envisaged
   according to the user's resolution to keep the vehicle for the entire
   lifespan or to sell it quickly.},

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The effect of Mn doping in the electronic structure of cubic KTaO3 has
   been studied by first-principles calculations, based on density
   functional theory. In our study, we analyze different Mn-dopant
   concentrations, namely 6.25 \%, 12.5 \%, and 25 \%, with Mn replacing
   Ta, K, or both sites, and probe changes in electrical, magnetic, and
   optical properties. Our results show that for Mn substituting Ta or K
   atoms, the structures acquire a metallic character and, when Mn
   substitutes both Ta and K atoms, the structures conserve a semiconductor
   character. On the other hand, all doped structures acquire a
   ferromagnetic character and magnetic moment resides almost entirely in
   Mn atom, being larger when Mn substitutes K atoms. Analysis of the
   calculated optical properties, allows us to monitor changes in the
   absorption coefficient. We show that structures for Mn replacing both Ta
   and K sites display an increased absorption of electromagnetic radiation
   in the visible region. Analyzing the formal oxidation states, following
   a Bader's analysis of component atoms, allows us to explain changes in
   electrical, magnetic, and optical properties.},

   transitions},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYSICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {122},
Number = {19-20, SI},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {For molecular dynamics simulations of hard particles, we define dynamic
   neighbours as the distinct particles that collide with a given reference
   one during a specific time interval. This definition allows us to
   determine the distribution of the number of dynamic neighbours, its
   average, and its standard deviation. We will show that regardless of the
   time window used to identify dynamic neighbours, their distribution is
   correlated with diffusion coefficients, structure, and configurational
   entropy. Thus, it is likely that the distribution of the number of
   dynamic neighbours may be employed as another tool to gain insights into
   the dynamic behaviour of hard-core systems. We tested this approach on
   2D and 3D systems consisting of monodisperse and binary mixtures of hard
   disks and spheres. Results show that implementing dynamic neighbours to
   define order parameters can sharpen the signals where transitions take
   place.

Title = {Fire regime shift associated with the European colonization in
   Mesoamerica},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {135},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study reconstructs fire history of Lake Atezca, Hidalgo, revealing
   two significant phases of plant biomass burning: one from -1140 to 1523
   CE and another from -1523 to 2005 CE. The first phase shows frequent
   fires, likely linked to pre-Hispanic agricultural practices. The second
   phase, starting around the time of the Spanish Conquest, showed a
   decrease in biomass burning, indicating a major shift in agricultural
   practices and demographic density after the Spanish intervention. The
   pre-Hispanic era, particularly during the Postclassic period, was marked
   by anthropogenic deforestation, associated with intensive practices such
   as slash-and-burn agriculture and rainfed cultivation. We also observed
   low values in C/N ratio, which can be related to forest soil degradation
   and loss of terrestrial nitrogen, due to periods with high of fires
   recurrence associated to these agricultural practices. The Spanish
   arrival was associated with a drastic reduction in the indigenous
   population and, the subsequent colonization led to significant changes
   in land use and fire practices. The suppression of indigenous fire-use
   practices, combined with severe drought conditions during the Conquest,
   resulted in a decreased in biomass burning. The Spanish Colonial period
   and the transition to modern Mexico were characterized by an increase in
   terrestrial organic matter input, likely due to the adoption of European
   farming techniques and livestock husbandry, causing high erosion in the
   landscape. Notably, the study highlights three wood-burning events
   (-1746-1794 CE, -1880-1918 CE, and -1954-1992 CE) potentially linked to
   severe droughts in the region: ``El An similar to o de Hambre{''}
   drought (1785-1786), the ``Revolution Drought{''} (1909-1910), and the
   1950s drought (1951-1957) that occurred in the mid-20th century. The
   presence of these events suggests a complex interplay between
   anthropogenic and climatic drivers in shaping Lake Atezca's ecosystem.},

Title = {Hippocampal neurogenesis facilitates cognitive flexibility in a fear
   discrimination task},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Hippocampal neurogenesis, the continuous creation of new neurons in the
   adult brain, influences memory, regulates the expression of defensive
   responses to threat (fear), and cognitive processes like pattern
   separation and behavioral flexibility. One hypothesis proposes that
   neurogenesis promotes cognitive flexibility by degrading established
   memories and promoting relearning. Yet, empirical evidence on its role
   in fear discrimination tasks is scarce. In this study, male rats were
   initially trained to differentiate between two similar environments, one
   associated with a threat. Subsequently, we enhanced neurogenesis through
   environmental enrichment and memantine treatments. We then reversed the
   emotional valence of these contexts. In both cases, neurogenesis
   improved the rats' ability to relearn the aversive context.
   Interestingly, we observed increased hippocampal activity, and decreased
   activity in the prelimbic cortex and lateral habenula, while the
   infralimbic cortex remained unchanged, suggesting neurogenesis-induced
   plasticity changes in this brain network. Moreover, when we
   pharmacologically inhibited the increased neurogenesis with
   Methotrexate, rats struggled to relearn context discrimination,
   confirming the crucial role of neurogenesis in this cognitive process.
   Overall, our findings highlight neurogenesis's capacity to facilitate
   changes in fear discrimination and emphasize the involvement of a
   prefrontal-hippocampal-habenula mechanism in this process. This study
   emphasizes the intricate relationship between hippocampal neurogenesis,
   cognitive flexibility, and the modulation of fear-related memories.},

Title = {Systematics of Urostephanus : resurrection of a Mesoamerican taxon of
   Gonolobinae (Apocynaceae, Asclepiadoideae), with eight new combinations},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {131},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: Recent studies have focused on resolving the
   systematics of the tribe Gonolobinae of the family Apocynaceae, as well
   as the controversial genus Matelea s.l. However, many species within
   Matelea s.l. have not been evaluated phylogenetically. This is the case
   of M. gonoloboides, previously recognized as the type species of
   Urostephanus, and other taxa with similar floral morphology. The aim of
   this study is to test the monophyly of Urostephanus, including some
   species with morphology similar to M. gonoloboides. Furthermore, we
   evaluate the taxonomic position of the Urostephanus clade within the
   subtribe Gonolobinae and compare morphology among related clades.
   Methods: To assess phylogenetic relationships within Gonolobinae, we
   downloaded sequences from four loci for 94 species of the subtribe from
   GenBank. We extracted DNA and sequenced the trnL-F intergenic spacer and
   rps16 intron from four species of Dictyanthus and six species of
   Matelea, which are considered to belong to Urostephanus. We
   reconstructed the phylogeny with Bayesian inference using the maximum
   clade credibility tree. Based on the phylogenetic pattern, we performed
   morphological comparisons between the clades Dictyanthus, Polystemma,
   and Urostephanus. Key results: Phylogenetic analysis recovered
   Urostephanus as monophyletic and sister to Dictyanthus. Based on this
   phylogenetic pattern and floral morphology, we resurrect the genus
   Urostephanus. We propose eight new combinations for the species included
   in the phylogeny, as well as for those that share floral morphological
   similarity. We designate two lectotypes. Finally, we discuss aspects of
   morphology between Urostephanus and closely related groups. Conclusions:
   The current circumscription of Matelea s.l. includes species with high
   morphological diversity. With the phylogenetic and morphological
   evidence among related taxa, we support the resurrection of
   Urostephanus, more than 120 years after its description. These results
   contribute to the resolution of the systematics of Gonolobinae in
   Mesoamerica.},

Abstract = {We present an analysis of diversity and biogeographic patterns of 260
   resident bird species in the tropical forests of Mexico, based on
   historical data (collected between the 18th century and 2007) and
   presence records from the last decade (2013-2023). We performed
   comparisons of the number and composition change of species, considering
   the ``historical{''} and ``current{''} distribution matrices, and a
   parsimony analysis of endemicity. According to historical data, the
   highest species richness is located on the slope of the Gulf of Mexico
   and the Yucatan Peninsula, while the seasonally dry forests of the
   Pacific coast and the Balsas Basin presented the highest values of
   endemic species. However, data collected in the last decade show a
   significant decline in the number of species in all areas analyzed. The
   beta diversity estimation indicated high values of change in species
   composition for the matrices evaluated. Biogeographic hypothesis
   obtained indicates the existence of 2 main groups: i) Pacific slope of
   Mexico and the Balsas Basin and ii) north of the Veracruzan province,
   the north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Yucatan Peninsula.},

Title = {Photothermal effect in X-ray images for computed tomography of metallic
   parts: Stainless steel spheres},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The environmental impact on industrial X-ray tomography
   systems has gained its attention in terms of image precision and
   metrology over recent years, yet is still complex due to the variety of
   applications.
   OBJECTIVE: The current study explores the photothermal repercussions of
   the overall radiation exposure time. It shows the emerging dimensional
   uncertainty when measuring a stainless steel sphere by means of circular
   tomography scans.
   METHODS: The authors develop a novel frame difference method for X-ray
   radiographies to evaluate the spatial changes induced in the projected
   absorption maps on the X-ray panel. The object of interest has a simple
   geometry for the purpose of proof of concept. The dominant source of the
   observed radial uncertainty is the photothermal effect due to
   high-energy X-ray scattering at the metal workpiece. Thermal variations
   are monitored by an infrared camera within the industrial tomography
   system, which confines that heat in the industrial grade X-ray system.
   RESULTS: The authors demonstrate that dense industrial computed
   tomography programs with major X-ray power notably affect the
   uncertainty of digital dimensional measurements. The registered
   temperature variations are consistent with dimensional changes in
   radiographies and hence form a source of error that might result in
   visible artifacts within the 3D image reconstruction.
   CONCLUSIONS: This contribution is of fundamental value to reach the
   balance between the number of projections and radial uncertainty
   tolerance when performing analysis with X-ray dimensional exploration in
   precision measurements with industrial tomography.},

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},

Volume = {95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The biogeographic regionalization of the Yucatan Peninsula is examined
   critically. The proliferation of the names assigned to different biotic
   units (e.g., Yucatan Peninsula, Yucatan, Yucatanan, Yucatecan, Peten,
   Peten-Yucatan, Campeche, Campechean, El Peten, and Campechean-Peten) is
   analyzed, and different problems identified. A unified area -taxonomy is
   proposed recognizing 3 units: the Yucatan Peninsula province Goldman and
   Moore, 1945, the Yucatecan district Smith, 1941, stat. nov., and the
   Peten district Smith, 1941. Smaller biotic units recognized by previous
   authors that may eventually be considered subdistricts cannot be
   diagnosed by sets of endemic species, so they are treated as synonyms of
   the 2 districts recognized in the present proposal.},

Title = {Influence of physical and microenviromental parameters on wood-degrading
   macromycetes of Abies religiosa (Pinaceae)},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {131},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: Wood-degrading macromycetes are the most important
   organisms in the decomposition of lignocellulose. However, taxonomic and
   ecological studies are scarce in temperate forests in the State of
   Mexico, Mexico. The main objective of the study was to provide
   information on the physical and microclimatic variation of the dead wood
   of Abies religiosa that influence the diversity of the fungal community
   in a temperate forest in Huixquilucan, State of Mexico. Methods: During
   the rainy season, from September to October 2021, we conducted fieldwork
   in the Abies religiosa forest located in Huixquilucan, State of Mexico.
   We sampled 100 dead trunks of A. religiosa and measuring the following
   variables: pH, temperature, volume, density, humidity, and softness of
   the wood. Similarly, the number of morphospecies of macromycetes and the
   abundance of sporomes were recorded. The genera and species of the
   macromycetes were determined and the values of richness and abundance
   were compared with the characteristics of the wood through a Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis. Key results: Forty six genera and 27 species
   were determined, 24 of them are new records for the sampling site. When
   evaluating the possible association between the dead wood
   characteristics with richness and diversity of macromycetes, we found
   that the richness and diversity of sporomes are mainly influenced by the
   hardness, density, and humidity of wood remains. Conclusions: The
   diversity of wood-degrading macromycetes of A. religiosa is very high.
   Particularly in this forest, the density, hardness, and humidity of the
   wood are the most important variables modulating the richness and
   diversity of the sporomes. The density of the wood is related to the
   humidity and there is no clear association with the hardness of the
   wood.},

   The measuring site was in the southwest corner of Mexico City. We sorted
   the data by OC/EC ratios and calculated four mass absorption
   efficiencies (MAEs) for each wavelength with linear regressions. The
   MAEs ranged from 2.27 to 19.75 and 2.03 to 15.26 m(2) g(-1) at 532 and
   870 nm, respectively, with determination coefficients above 0.88,
   showing that the amount of OC modifies the absorption properties of
   particles, sometimes underestimating or overestimating the black carbon
   concentration. It is possible to choose the MAE based on the daily
   median O-3 concentration when there is no information about the EC and

Title = {Epidemiological landscape of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and
   its impact on amphibian diversity at global scale},

Abstract = {Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd), is a major driver of amphibian decline worldwide.
   The global presence of Bd is driven by a synergy of factors, such as
   climate, species life history, and amphibian host susceptibility. Here,
   using a Bayesian data-mining approach, we modeled the epidemiological
   landscape of Bd to evaluate how infection varies across several spatial,
   ecological, and phylogenetic scales. We compiled global information on
   Bd occurrence, climate, species ranges, and phylogenetic diversity to
   infer the potential distribution and prevalence of Bd. By calculating
   the degree of co-distribution between Bd and our set of environmental
   and biological variables (e.g. climate and species), we identified the
   factors that could potentially be related to Bd presence and prevalence
   using a geographic correlation metric, epsilon (epsilon). We fitted five
   ecological models based on 1) amphibian species identity, 2)
   phylogenetic species variability values for a given species assemblage,
   3) temperature, 4) precipitation and 5) all variables together. Our
   results extend the findings of previous studies by identifying the
   epidemiological landscape features of Bd. This ecological modeling
   framework allowed us to generate explicit spatial predictions for Bd
   prevalence at global scale and a ranked list of species with high/low
   probability of Bd presence. Our geographic model identified areas with
   high potential for Bd prevalence (potential Bd-risk areas) and areas
   with low potential Bd prevalence as potential refuges (free Bd). At the
   amphibian assemblage level, we found non-relationship with amphibian
   phylogenetic signals, but a significantly negative correlation between
   observed species richness and Bd prevalence indicated a potential
   dilution effect at the landscape scale. Our model may identify species
   and areas potentially susceptible and at risk for Bd presence, which
   could be used to prioritize regions for amphibian conservation efforts
   and to assess species and assemblage at risks.},

   (11-)13-29(-37)), longer stipules (4.5-8 mm vs. 0.3-1.5 mm), reflexed
   (vs. ascending), persistent (vs. deciduous), terminal panicle
   inflorescences (vs. axillary racemes), and the wing petals subelliptic
   (vs. ovate). This is the second species of the hitherto monospecific
   subgenus Psoropteris, and the whorled-leaf character is recorded for the

   prove that for some Hausdorff extensions X(Q )of a space X constructed
   using free filters on X, the space C-p(X-Q, G) is selectively
   sequentially pseudocompact. We therefore obtain a class of spaces having

Title = {Sex Differences in Aggression: Female Hermit Crabs Initiate Few Fights

Abstract = {Individuals with similar biological requirements frequently compete for
   resources. Males and females have evolved different reproductive
   strategies in which females invest more in fecundity and males in
   intrasexual competition for mates. Although less common than within-sex
   competition, intersexual contests may occur to obtain resources.
   Interindividual differences in fighting ability bias the benefits and
   costs between opponents, and those differences are expected to be
   greater in intersexual contests. We compared the chela size, muscular
   strength, metabolic rate, and relative boldness of males and females of
   Calcinus californiensis Bouvier, 1898. We further investigated how these
   traits influence intra- and intersexual contests for shells, with both
   sexes assuming roles as attackers and defenders. Males and females do
   not differ in chela size, muscular strength, or boldness. While males
   exhibited higher metabolic rates, this did not explain contest
   initiation or outcomes. Surprisingly, females initiated fewer contests
   against males than against females, and those that did often lost.
   However, this outcome was not attributed to sexually dimorphic traits.
   Instead, fighting success correlated with individual boldness and
   rapping frequency. Interestingly, rapping performance did not correlate
   with boldness, metabolic rate, or muscular strength, contrary to
   expectations. Our result reaffirms the common disadvantage of females as
   attackers in intersexual contests. However, they proved adept at
   defending their shells in both intra- and intersexual scenarios. This
   result, in addition to their typically efficient exploratory ability,
   raises questions about resource acquisition and distribution pathways in
   each sex.},

Title = {Do male reproductive traits evolve at the intraspecific level in
   response to the amount of placentotrophy in a genus of viviparous
   fishes?},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},

Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Placentotrophy is a particular type of maternal provisioning to
   developing embryos, in which mothers actively provide nutrients via
   complex placental structures. Placentotrophy implies less
   pre-fertilization investment, resulting in a shift from pre- to
   post-copulatory sexual selection. This change can potentially result in
   a conflict between females and males. This phenomenon has been
   demonstrated at the interspecific level in viviparous fishes of the
   family Poeciliidae, in which males of species that lack placentotrophy
   have evolved traits related to pre-copulatory sexual selection such as
   coloration, ornaments, and courtship behavior. Placentotrophic species,
   on the other hand, have evolved traits associated with post-copulatory
   sexual selection such as long intromittent organs (gonopodium) and
   increased sexual coercion behavior. Here we test, for the first time at
   the intraspecific level, whether there is a similar relationship between
   a higher degree of female placentotrophy and the evolution of male
   reproductive traits (larger testes and longer gonopodia) in three
   species of the genus Poeciliopsis (P. gracilis, P. infans, and P.
   prolifica). We observed a tendency towards longer gonopodia in males of
   P. gracilis as well as the largest testes of P. prolifica males in the
   populations with the highest degrees of placentotrophy. However, the
   statistical support for these findings was relatively weak. Therefore,
   we failed to support the hypothesis of a selective effect of female
   placentotrophy on male gonads and genitalia. We discuss other
   evolutionary forces that may have driven the observed intraspecific
   variation in male reproductive traits of Poeciliopsis fishes.},

Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
   The emergence and rapid spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains
   urge us to develop novel treatments. Experimental trials are constrained
   by laboratory capacity, insufficient funds, low number of laboratory
   animals and obsolete technology. Systems-level approaches to
   quantitatively study TB can overcome these limitations. Previously, we
   proposed a mathematical model describing the key regulatory mechanisms
   underlying the pathological progression of TB. Here, we systematically
   explore the effect of parameter variations on disease outcome. We find
   five bifurcation parameters that steer the clinical outcome of TB:
   number of bacteria phagocytosed per macrophage, macrophages death,
   macrophage killing by bacteria, macrophage recruitment, and phagocytosis
   of bacteria. The corresponding bifurcation diagrams show all-or-nothing
   dose-response curves with parameter regions mapping onto bacterial
   clearance, persistent infection, or history-dependent clearance or
   infection. Importantly, the pathogenic stage strongly affects the
   sensitivity of the host to these parameter variations. We identify
   parameter values corresponding to a latent-infection model of TB, where
   disease progression occurs significantly slower than in progressive TB.
   Two-dimensional bifurcation analyses uncovered synergistic parameter
   pairs that could act as efficient compound therapeutic approaches.
   Through bifurcation analysis, we reveal how modulation of specific
   regulatory mechanisms could steer the clinical outcome of TB.},

Title = {The Nβ motif of NaTrxh directs secretion as an endoplasmic reticulum

Abstract = {Soluble secretory proteins with a signal peptide reach the extracellular
   space through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi conventional pathway.
   During translation, the signal peptide is recognised by the signal
   recognition particle and results in a co-translational translocation to
   the endoplasmic reticulum to continue the secretory pathway. However,
   soluble secretory proteins lacking a signal peptide are also abundant,
   and several unconventional (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi independent)
   pathways have been proposed and some demonstrated. This work describes
   new features of the secretion signal called N beta, originally
   identified in NaTrxh, a plant extracellular thioredoxin, that does not
   possess an orthodox signal peptide. We provide evidence that other
   proteins, including thioredoxins type h, with similar sequences are also
   signal peptide-lacking secretory proteins. To be a secretion signal,
   positions 5, 8 and 9 must contain neutral residues in plant proteins-a
   negative residue in position 8 is suggested in animal proteins-to
   maintain the N beta motif negatively charged and a hydrophilic profile.
   Moreover, our results suggest that the NaTrxh translocation to the
   endoplasmic reticulum occurs as a post-translational event. Finally, the
   N beta motif sequence at the N- or C-terminus could be a feature that
   may help to predict protein localisation, mainly in plant and animal
   proteins.},

Title = {Structural studies of local environments in high-symmetry quasicrystals},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {The statistics of how the local environment of a particle looks like,
   e.g., given by the distribution of nearest neighbor distances or the
   sizes of Voronoi cells, is important as a starting point for the
   calculation of many material properties like electronic or photonic band
   structures. Here we study local environments that occur in quasicrystals
   with large rotational symmetry. Both with analytical considerations
   based on geometric arguments and with an analysis of a large number of
   numerically created patches of high-symmetry quasicrystals we find that
   the Voronoi area's distribution reaches a bimodal curve and that in the
   limit of large rotational symmetries the distribution of nearest
   neighbor distance converges against a universal curve, where 27.7\% of
   the vertices have their nearest neighbor at a normalized distance equal
   to 1, while for the other 72.3\% the nearest neighbor is at a distance
   less than 1. Therefore, the statistics of local environments is
   non-trivial but independent of the specific rotational symmetry. Thus
   properties that only depend on local environments are expected to be
   universal for all high-symmetry quasicrystals.},

Abstract = {In this paper we obtain new results regarding the chain conditions in

   the cellularity and weak separation number of X (see Sect. 4) and we
   define the cardinals
   c{*} (X) := sup\{c(X-n) : n is an element of N\} and R{*} (X) :=
   sup\{R(X-n) : n is an element of N\},
   then we show that R{*} (X) = c{*} (F{[}X]). On the other hand, in Sakai
   (Topol Appl 159:3080-3088, 2012, Question 3.23, p. 3087) Sakai asked
   whether the fact that F{[}X] is weakly Lindelof implies that X is
   hereditarily separable and proved that if X is countably tight then the
   previous question has an affirmative answer. We shall expand Sakai's
   result by proving that if F{[}X] is weakly Lindelof and X satisfies any
   of the following conditions:
   center dot X is a Hausdorff k-space; center dot X is a countably tight
   T-1-space; center dot X is weakly separated,
   then X is hereditarily separable.},

Abstract = {Mexico is a major center of evolutionary radiation for the genus
   Quercus, with oak species occurring across different habitat types and
   showing a wide variation in morphology and growth form. Despite
   representing about 20\% of Mexican species, scrub oaks have received
   little attention and even basic aspects of their taxonomy and geographic
   distribution remain unresolved. In this study, we analyzed the
   morphological and climatic niche differentiation of scrub oak
   populations forming a complex constituted by six named species, Quercus
   cordifolia, Quercus frutex, Quercus intricata, Quercus microphylla,
   Quercus repanda, Quercus striatula and a distinct morphotype of Q.
   striatula identified during field and herbarium work (hereafter named Q.
   striatula II). Samples were obtained from 35 sites covering the
   geographic distribution of the complex in northern and central Mexico.
   Morphological differentiation was analyzed through geometric
   morphometrics of leaf shape and quantification of trichome traits. Our
   results indicated the presence of two main morphological groups with
   geographic concordance. The first was formed by Q. frutex, Q.
   microphylla, Q. repanda and Q. striatula, distributed in the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, the Sierra Madre Occidental and a little
   portion of the south of the Mexican Altiplano (MA). The second group
   consists of Q. cordifola, Q. intricata and Q. striatula II, found in the
   Sierra Madre Oriental and the MA. Therefore, our evidence supports the
   distinctness of the Q. striatula II morphotype, indicating the need for
   a taxonomic revision. Within the two groups, morphological
   differentiation among taxa varied from very clear to low or inexistent
   (i.e. Q. microphylla-Q. striatula and Q. cordifolia-Q. striatula II) but
   niche comparisons revealed significant niche differentiation in all
   pairwise comparisons, highlighting the relevance of integrative
   approaches for the taxonomic resolution of complicated groups such as
   the one studied here.},

Abstract = {Key messageAnalysis of wood anatomical traits revealed that drought
   tolerance predominates in early-successional communities, and vessel
   variability is relevant for species' ecological success in seasonally
   dry tropical environments.AbstractSuccessional tropical dry forests
   harbor a diverse array of species subjected to a strong seasonal
   precipitation regime. Considering that wood encompasses diverse
   functional properties related to stem hydraulics and mechanical support,
   in this study, we asked which quantitative anatomical traits are
   exhibited by co-occurring species in early (EC)- and late
   (LC)-successional communities. We used generalized linear mixed-effects
   models to estimate and compare means and standard deviations of wood
   traits (vessel area, vessel density, vessel grouping, and fiber
   dimensions) between eight EC and between 13 LC co-occurring species.
   Wood traits were highly heterogeneous. High vessel redundancy, a
   property associated with water safety involved in the prevention of
   hydraulic failure, prevails among species coexisting in EC but is
   maintained through succession by the same species in LC. Highly variable
   fiber dimensions indicate that species coexisting in LC possess
   different characteristics associated with mechanical resistance. Low
   wood density species typical of LC, which are absent from EC, displayed
   wood anatomical features associated with drought-evasion mechanisms.
   This result implies that deforestation not only reduces taxonomic but
   also functional diversity. Future research should adopt a standard
   deviation analysis approach, as this will allow confirming the high
   variability in vessel diameter, even in diffuse porous species, as a key
   feature for the ecological success of plants facing succession-driven
   changes in seasonally dry environments.},

Title = {Leaf functional diversity and environmental filtering in a tropical dry
   forest: Comparison between two geological substrates},

Abstract = {The role of geological substrate in shaping plant community functional
   diversity remains poorly understood. Considering the involvement of
   leaves in the energy, water, and nutrient economics of plants, we
   hypothesized that leaves experience geology-related filtering, which in
   turn shapes their functional attributes and community leaf functional
   diversity on different substrates. We studied tropical dry forest
   communities on limestone and siliciclastic phyllite-derived soils,
   comparing their functional diversity and soil physico-chemical
   properties. We predicted the most benign habitat (less severe filter) to
   be associated with higher leaf functional diversity and an acquisitive
   strategy prevalence, while the more stressful habitat should show
   conservative leaf traits and lower leaf functional diversity. We
   measured six traits in 31 common tree species (representing similar to
   80\% of community crown cover): leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf
   thickness, leaf dry matter content, petiole length, and leaf blade
   narrowness. Leaf functional diversity was assessed through the
   functional trait dispersion metric. Intraspecific functional variation
   was examined in 25 species shared between substrates. The limestone
   substrate was more fertile (higher phosphorous) with higher water
   retention, while phyllite had higher nitrogen and lower humidity.
   Principal component analysis segregated plots by substrate, with
   limestone plots being more clustered. Community leaf functional
   diversity was higher in the limestone forest. Most species examined
   showed inter-substrate trait differences in at least one leaf functional
   trait. The two substrates constituted distinct growth environments, with
   the more benign substrate associated with higher community leaf
   functional diversity. The intraspecific analysis revealed the prevalence
   of acquisitive traits in the more benign and more conservative traits in
   the more stressful habitat. This study advances our understanding of the
   role of geological substrate as an environmental filter in tropical dry
   forests, influencing leaf functional responses and emphasizing the
   importance of intraspecific functional variation.},

Abstract = {The eighteenth data release (DR18) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
   (SDSS) is the first one for SDSS-V, the fifth generation of the survey.
   SDSS-V comprises three primary scientific programs or ``Mappers{''}: the
   Milky Way Mapper (MWM), the Black Hole Mapper (BHM), and the Local
   Volume Mapper. This data release contains extensive targeting
   information for the two multiobject spectroscopy programs (MWM and BHM),
   including input catalogs and selection functions for their numerous
   scientific objectives. We describe the production of the targeting
   databases and their calibration and scientifically focused components.
   DR18 also includes \& SIM;25,000 new SDSS spectra and supplemental
   information for X-ray sources identified by eROSITA in its eFEDS field.
   We present updates to some of the SDSS software pipelines and preview
   changes anticipated for DR19. We also describe three value-added
   catalogs (VACs) based on SDSS-IV data that have been published since
   DR17, and one VAC based on the SDSS-V data in the eFEDS field.},

Title = {Predicting dynamic trajectories of a protected plant community under
   contrasting conservation regimes: Insights from data-based modelling},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {484},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Data-based modelling of the dynamic behaviour of ecological communities
   is a big challenge in systems ecology and conservation biology.
   Implementing such models to forecast future scenarios is key for
   supporting decisionmaking in ecological reserves, given the multiple
   disturbances threatening their future. Using demographic and dynamic
   data for three tree (or tree-like) species from the Pedregal de San \&
   PRIME;Angel Ecological Reserve (Mexico City, Mexico), we constructed a
   family of dynamical models (using systems of ordinary differential
   equations) to reconstruct their dynamic interactions. The first two
   models considered two native species (Pittocaulon praecox and Buddleja
   cordata), with either antagonistic or cooperative interactions between
   them. These species have been considered ecosystem engineers playing
   different roles in the system and determining several community
   attributes. These models predict the transition from a stable steady
   state dominated by P. praecox (as reported in the 1950s) to the current
   community whose structure is apparently shifting to an alternative
   stable state dominated by B. cordata. The second pair of models
   additionally incorporate the invasive tree Eucalyptus camaldulensis,
   which exerts negative effects on all native plant species. The
   prediction of these models is an E. camaldulensis-dominated state with
   the exclusion of the native species from the reserve, provided this
   invasive species follows current population growth trends, without
   external intervention to check this process. Bifurcation analysis of
   this latter model allowed us to rationally design optimal intervention
   strategies that could potentially divert the trajectory from converging
   to an E. camaldulensis-only configuration into the stable coexistence of
   the native species. For the two-species and three-species models we made
   two versions, one with only competitive interactions and another one
   including a facilitation interaction between B. cordata and P. praecox.
   This analysis shows that facilitation is a requirement to achieve stable
   coexistence between the two native species, even in the presence of E.
   camaldulensis. The models constructed here, which integrate multiple
   data sources, help clarify conflicting empirical information regarding
   potential ecological mechanisms, and allow making predictions for
   strengthening the future management and E. camaldulensis control
   programs before its effects irreversibly modify the functioning and
   biodiversity of the biotic community protected in the reserve.},

Title = {Design and analysis of tweet-based election models for the 2021 Mexican
   legislative election},
Journal = {EPJ DATA SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Modelling and forecasting real-life human behaviour using online social
   media is an active endeavour of interest in politics, government,
   academia, and industry. Since its creation in 2006, Twitter has been
   proposed as a potential laboratory that could be used to gauge and
   predict social behaviour. During the last decade, the user base of
   Twitter has been growing and becoming more representative of the general
   population. Here we analyse this user base in the context of the 2021
   Mexican Legislative Election. To do so, we use a dataset of 15 million
   election-related tweets in the six months preceding election day. We
   explore different election models that assign political preference to
   either the ruling parties or the opposition. We find that models using
   data with geographical attributes determine the results of the election
   with better precision and accuracy than conventional polling methods.
   These results demonstrate that analysis of public online data can
   outperform conventional polling methods, and that political analysis and
   general forecasting would likely benefit from incorporating such data in
   the immediate future. Moreover, the same Twitter dataset with
   geographical attributes is positively correlated with results from
   official census data on population and internet usage in Mexico. These
   findings suggest that we have reached a period in time when online
   activity, appropriately curated, can provide an accurate representation
   of offline behaviour.},

Abstract = {In this article, we will describe a model to examine the influence of
   differently organized institutions on their scientific productivity. We
   take two extreme cases, on one hand, an institution divided in
   departments with no collaboration between people in different
   departments. These could be disciplines or merely projects. On the other
   hand, we consider an institution that allows interactions between all
   individuals, without a departmental structure to a department. We
   compare the results with data from the Institute of Renewable Energy
   (IER) at UNAM, which has changed its organization and policies during
   the last 30 years, and we could quantitatively predict the changes
   observed in productivity and multidisciplinarity. This model can be
   applied to a broader set of institutions and processes.},

Title = {Generation of vorticity at the open end of acoustic waveguides},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {For periodic acoustic fields of sufficient intensity inside a
   cylindrical tube, a nonlinear mechanism is responsible for the
   generation of vorticity at the open end of the tube. It has been
   observed that as the magnitude of the acoustic velocity is increased,
   different regimes are possible. At first, we consider the inner edge of
   the duct to be straight. In the first regime, vorticity appears only in
   the immediate vicinity of the open end of the tube. For higher acoustic
   velocities, vortex rings are formed at this same location, and finally,
   for even larger velocities, they are advected outwards. In all cases
   roundingoff the inner edge of the tube to different degrees leads to a
   suppression of the mechanism responsible for the generation of
   vorticity, with the more noticeable suppression occurring for the
   smoother edges. The parameter that determines the scale at which
   different behaviors occur is a Reynolds number R delta associated with
   the width of the acoustic boundary layer inside the duct. We use a
   three-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to simulate the
   velocity and the pressure fields at the exit of the tube, for different
   values of R delta, allowing for validation of the numerical method
   against experimental measurements. In this regard, we conduct
   experiments with 2D phase-locked particle image velocimetry (PL-PIV)
   within a similar range of values of R delta. The expected behavior is
   observed in both experimental and numerical results, and the results
   obtained by means of the numerical scheme are consistent with those
   obtained through PIV measurements, with different regimes exhibiting
   varying combinations of acoustic streaming, boundary-layer separation,
   and vortex shedding.},

Abstract = {This article shines new light on the classical problem of tiling
   rectangles with squares efficiently with a novel method. With a twist on
   the traditional approach of resistor networks, we provide new and
   improved results on the matter using the theory of Diophantine
   Approximation, hence overcoming long-established difficulties, such as
   generalizations to higher-dimensional analogues. The universality of the
   method is demonstrated through its applications to different tiling
   problems. These include tiling rectangles with other rectangles, with
   their respective higher-dimensional counterparts, as well as tiling
   equilateral triangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids with equilateral
   triangles.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {94},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many urban environments are places with strong stressors that
   substantially modify water quality. Although tests evaluating water
   quality are usually physico-chemical, including biological components
   can also provide relevant information. Lake Chalco, at the border
   between Mexico City and Estado de Mexico, interacts with the surrounding
   human population. We investigated some water quality parameters and the
   community of macroinvertebrates living in Lake Chalco. From January to
   October 2017, we sampled water along the shoreline in 4 permanent areas
   of the lake. We recorded the NH4+, NO3-N, NO2-N, total P, Zn, Cu2+, ORP,
   DO, TDS, conductivity, and pH. In addition, we characterized the
   richness, composition, and abundance of the macroinvertebrate community.
   There was spatial and temporal variation in physico-chemical parameters,
   perhaps due to the agricultural activity around the lake. Nevertheless,
   water quality was unable to be placed in a category of the national law.
   Four out of 20 macroinvertebrate RTU's significantly correlated with
   environmental variables. Thus, no bioindicators could be proposed. In
   general, lake water quality is poor, so it is not recommended for
   anthropic activities. Yet, the lake may be important as a center of
   dispersion for aquatic invertebrates.},

   collections of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) were
   reviewed. Among 1,605 specimens identified as Squilla empusa and
   collected in the coasts of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, and Tabasco, we
   detected 8 specimens of Gibbesia neglecta. The specimens of G. neglecta
   were captured in a commercial shrimp trawl in 3 collection sites on the
   continental shelf of Tamaulipas and Tabasco, and in the Tamiahua lagoon,
   Veracruz, Mexico and they represent the first records of this species in
   Mexican waters. The bathymetric interval of the G. neglecta samples
   coincided with previous records thus confirming that its maximum depth
   is, up to now, 64 m. The current distribution of G. neglecta is analyzed
   and compared with that known for S. empusa.},

Title = {A long-term study of the algal flora in urban lakes},
Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {94},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The algal flora in the lakes and streams of the Cantera Oriente of the
   Reserva Ecologica del Pedregal de San angel of the UNAM has been
   monitored for 14 years. Semiannual records were collected for that
   period, accounting for 270 taxa from 8 divisions. Eighty-seven percent
   of this flora has been present from 1 to 7 occasions, and only 15
   species were present from 11 to 14 years. In this count, 5 species are
   new records for Mexico. Specifying species as rare, frequent, or
   constant corresponds with collection data. Still, it is at odds with the
   species qualification by geographic distribution (cosmopolitan, broad,
   or restricted), as 156 cosmopolitan species were rare, and only 11 with
   that rating were constant. We discuss the importance of monitoring the
   flora to characterize a water body by the biological component, the
   changes in the flora, and the supposed eurioic responses of cosmopolitan
   species in environmental conditions without drastic changes; the impact
   of these aspects on the national and Mexico City floristic count is
   evaluated. This study is the first long-term analysis of continental
   algae in our country.},

Title = {Integration or minimalism: twenty-one new species of ghost spiders

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {865},
Pages = {1-94},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {The rhythm of biodiversity loss vastly surpasses the number of new
   species described per year, with several taxa going extinct without us
   even knowing about their existence. After more than 250 years of
   traditional taxonomy, it is clear that the rate of biodiversity
   description and discovery needs to be improved. Molecular data has
   greatly increased the speed of species discovery and accuracy of
   taxonomic delimitation. Phenotypic documentation, although relatively
   slower, is still crucial to identify species and communicate taxonomic
   discoveries to a broader audience. Here, we integrate these data sources
   to describe a relatively large number of new species of the spider genus
   Anyphaena and look into its internal phylogenetic relationships. Our
   findings support the existence of several species groups within
   Anyphaena (as currently defined), but failed to recover the monophyly of
   this genus, suggesting a more comprehensive revision of its species
   groups and closely related anyphaenid genera is necessary. The 21 new
   species described here are: Anyphaena adnani sp. nov., A. bifurcata sp.
   nov., A. dulceae sp. nov., A. epicardia sp. nov., A. fernandae sp. nov.,

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework to compare the differences in the
   occupation probabilities of two random walk processes, which can be
   generated by modifications of the network or the transition
   probabilities between the nodes of the same network. We explore a
   dissimilarity measure defined in terms of the eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian of each process. This formalism
   is implemented to examine differences in the diffusive dynamics
   described by circulant matrices, the effect of new edges, and the
   rewiring in networks as well as to evaluate divergences in the transport
   in degree-biased random walks and random walks with stochastic reset.
   Our results provide a general tool to compare dynamical processes on
   networks considering the evolution of states and capturing the
   complexity of these structures.},

Title = {Raptors in the city: Site occupancy and abundance of a top predator
   inhabiting urban green spaces within a megacity},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {234},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces have the potential to harbor a rich biodiversity,
   including top predators, which maintain the structure and regulate the
   dynamic processes of these urban ecosystems. Conservation of top
   predators in cities requires quantitative knowledge of their
   populations. In this study, we provide critical information about
   population abundance and site occupancy rates of Harris's hawks
   (Parabuteo unicinctus) inhabiting urban green spaces in one of the
   largest cities in the world, Mexico City. We asked if this population
   permanently resides in the city or, alternatively, if individuals move
   into the city only during particular periods of the year. In addition,
   we tested the hypothesis that prey abundance in urban green spaces is
   the most important environmental trait that promotes the presence of
   this raptor in this megacity. We found that both population abundance
   and site occupancy rates differed between the dry and rainy seasons,
   increasing during the latter season. This seasonal change indicated that
   some individuals immigrated to the city and/or the presence of juveniles
   that were born just before the rainy season. Inter-estingly, their
   habitat preferences differed between seasons. During the dry season,
   when hawks are apparently nesting, they occupy parks surrounded by tall
   buildings and located relatively far from other green areas. In
   contrast, during the rainy season, hawks prefer parks with high
   abundance of large prey (doves and pigeons). Based on our findings, we
   propose specific management actions aimed at facilitating the presence
   of nesting individuals in the urban landscape.},

Abstract = {Fabaceae is a monophyletic family comprising more than 22 000 species
   worldwide. In Mexico, it is the second-most species rich family,
   inhabiting multiple ecosystems with a high diversity of life forms. Our
   aims were to (1) identify areas of endemism (AEs) by using endemicity
   analysis at different cell sizes (1 degrees, 0.5 degrees and 0.25
   degrees) for 488 Mexican legumes, (2) describe the climatic and
   topographic heterogeneity of AE, (3) determine whether there is a
   positive relationship between AEs and climatic and topographic
   heterogeneity and (4) examine the conservation status of legumes that
   defined the AEs. We found six general AEs, supported by 63 species, with
   endemicity index values ranging from 2.05 to 6.86. These general areas
   had zones where biogeographical provinces intersected and exhibited a
   higher environmental heterogeneity. Areas detected at 1 degrees showed a
   positive relationship between endemicity index and environmental
   heterogeneity. Legume species currently lack legal protection in Mexico,
   69\% of the endemic species do not have an evaluation category according
   to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and eight species
   are in some risk category. Future conservation efforts should focus on
   protecting endemism areas from accomplishing representative natural
   protected areas.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe genus Ternstroemia is associated with the vulnerable
   tropical montane cloud forest in Mexico and with other relevant
   vegetation types worldwide. It contains threatened and pharmacologically
   important species and has taxonomic issues regarding its species limits.
   This study describes 38 microsatellite markers generated using a
   genomic-based approach.Methods and resultsWe tested 23 of these markers
   in a natural population of Ternstroemia lineata. These markers are
   highly polymorphic (all loci polymorphic with 3-14 alleles per locus and
   expected heterozygosity between 0.202 and 0.908), most of them (19 out
   of 23) are in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and free of null alleles (18
   out of 23). Also we found no evidence of linkage among them. Finally, we
   tested the transferability to six other American species of
   Ternstroemia, two other Pentaphylacaceae species, and four species from
   different families within the order Ericales.ConclusionsThese molecular
   resources are promising tools to investigate genetic diversity loss and
   as barcodes for ethnopharmacological applications and species
   delimitation in the family Pentaphylacaceae and some Ericales, among
   other applications.},

Title = {Alkaloidal variation in seedlings of Annona purpurea Moc.

Abstract = {Annona purpurea is a species of the Annonaceae family that more than 50
   alkaloids. Some alkaloids carry out defense functions and can be grouped
   from an ecological perspective as constitutive and induced metabolites.
   The latter are expressed in response to changes in abiotic or biotic
   conditions that trigger stress in a plant. However, there are few
   systematic studies of constitutive metabolite profiles and their
   responses to biotic stress, despite the relevance of this concept. This
   work analyzed the differences in constitutive and induced alkaloids in
   A. purpurea seedlings infected with the phytopathogen Colletotrichum
   gloeosporioides. For this study, methanolic extracts of seedling leaves,
   stems, and roots inoculated with the fungus and not inoculated with the
   fungus were obtained and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass
   spectrometry. The richness and abundance of alkaloids between the
   treatments and between organs were represented using the Margalef,
   Shannon, and Simpson ecological indices and the analysis of principal
   components, PERMANOVA, and paired PERMANOVA. Twenty-one alkaloids were
   detected from two biosynthetic pathways distributed in the seedling
   organs, and 15 of these alkaloids were considered constitutive because
   they are also found in adults. Most of the constitutive al-kaloids in
   the seedlings were observed in the roots (15 compounds), followed by the
   stems (11 chemicals) and leaves (9 chemicals). The diversity indices
   also showed differences between the organs. Infection with the fungus
   modified the constitutive profile of the alkaloids by inducing an
   increase in lirinidine (61\%) and papaverine (403\%) in the roots and
   N,N-dimethyl, 2-(methylamino) 3-phenylindole (143\%) in the leaves. Due
   to the infection, no new alkaloids were detected in any organ.},

Abstract = {Water mites of the superfamily Hydryphantoidea occur on all continents
   except Antarctica. Here, after reviewing the history of water mite
   taxonomy in South America, we provide a catalogue of members of the four
   hydryphantoid families present in South America: Hydryphantidae,
   Hydrodromidae, Rhynchohydracari-dae and Thermacaridae. To date, 55 named
   species have been reported from this region. The great majority of South
   American hydryphantoids are known exclu-sively as adults, with larvae
   having been described from only three of the 55 species. We include data
   on type localities and the known distribution of the species, and
   provide a key to all taxa reported from South America. We also include
   molecular data (COI barcodes) for four species representing all three
   genera of Rhyncho-hydracaridae recorded from the continent:

Title = {The uncharacterized Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA4189 is a novel and
   efficient aminoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {480},
Number = {4},
Pages = {259-281},

Abstract = {Neither the Pseudomonas aeruginosa aldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by the
   PA4189 gene nor its ortholog proteins have been biochemically or
   structurally characterized and their physiological function is unknown.
   We cloned the PA4189 gene, obtained the PA4189 recombinant protein, and
   studied its structure-function relationships. PA4189 is an
   NAD+-dependent aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase highly efficient with
   protonated ami-noacetaldehyde and 3-aminopropionaldehyde, which are much
   more preferred to the non-protonated species as indicated by pH studies.
   Based on the higher activity with aminoacetaldehyde than with
   3-aminopropionaldehyde, we propose that aminoacetalde-hyde might be the
   PA4189 physiological substrate. Even though at the physiological pH of
   P. aeruginosa cells the non-protonated aminoacetaldehyde species will be
   predomin-ant, and despite the competition of these species with the
   protonated ones, PA4189 would very efficiently oxidize ACTAL in vivo,
   producing glycine. To our knowledge, PA4189 is the first reported enzyme
   that might metabolize ACTAL, which is considered a dead-end metabolite
   because its consuming reactions are unknown. The PA4189 crystal
   structure reported here suggested that the charge and size of the
   active-site residue Glu457, which narrows the aldehyde-entrance tunnel,
   greatly define the specificity for small positively charged aldehydes,
   as confirmed by the kinetics of the E457G and E457Q variants. Glu457 and
   the residues that determine Glu457 conformation inside the active site
   are conserved in the PA4189 orthologs, which we only found in
   proteobacteria species. Also is conserved the PA4189 genomic
   neighborhood, which suggests that PA4189 participates in an
   uncharacterized metabolic pathway. Our results open the door to future
   efforts to characterize this pathway.},

Abstract = {The skin represents our first defense against physical, mechanical, or
   biological damage. However, its regeneration potential depends on the
   degree of the wound and the systemic state. For large acute or chronic
   wounds, specialized treatments are required to stimulate regeneration
   and avoid scarring. The use of nanotechnology represents a promising
   tool to promote wound healing, not only by developing antibacterial
   nanomaterials to prevent infection, but also by developing nanomaterials
   capable of enhancing cell proliferation, extracellular matrix
   deposition, and angiogenesis, as well as regulating inflammation.
   Nanotechnology offers a new and wide field of application for materials,
   due to the unique properties of nanomaterials that normally differ from,
   or are enhanced compared to, bulk materials. Nanomaterial properties
   changed mainly due to its larger contact area, which normally results in
   better optical, catalytic, and biodistribution properties. Due to their
   physical-chemical characteristics, nanoparticles can be tailored in
   different ways to be delivered and act at the site of injury, improving
   wound healing. Nanoparticles can be incorporated into different
   substrates to generate antibacterial coverages, they can be
   functionalized and tailored to be used as vectors for delivering
   signaling molecules (growth factors), or their properties such as size,
   crystallinity, surface chemistry, and shape can be modified to elicit
   different biological effects. The present work is aimed at resuming the
   advances of the last decade in nanoparticles used to improve wound
   healing based on their antimicrobial activity, cell proliferation
   enhancement, angiogenesis promotion, regulation of extracellular matrix
   deposition, and anti-inflammatory modulation.},

Abstract = {Mexico possesses a large diversity of amphibians partly due to its
   complex topography and transitional position between the Nearctic and
   Neotropical biogeographical regions. However, its helminth parasite
   fauna has been relatively poorly studied. Specimens of the Vaillant's
   frog, Lithobates vaillanti (Brocchi) were sampled in the tropical rain
   forest of Naha, in the Chiapas Highlands, and examined for parasites.
   Two trematode species were collected from their hosts; morphologically,
   specimens were allocated to the genera Langeronia Caballero and
   Bravo-Hollis, 1949 and Haematoloechus Looss, 1899, respectively.
   Individuals were sequenced for two molecular markers (the mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase gene, and the ribosomal gene 28S), and processed
   for morphological analyses, including scanning electron microscopy. The
   new evidence was not enough to accomplish the identification at species
   level of Langeronia sp. due to the lack of sequence data from the type
   localities of Langeronia parva Christian, 1970 and Langeronia macrocirra
   Caballero and Bravo-Hollis, 1949. Likewise, the newly generated data
   were useful to properly identify the adult specimens of lung flukes as
   Haematoloechus complexus Seely, 1906.},

Abstract = {Dengue disease is a major public health problem in the world with a fast
   spreading rate. Human migration has contibute to spread of the different
   serotypes of dengue virus, incrementing the risk of dengue hemorrhagic
   fever and dengue shock syndrome. The disease immunological response is
   complex, with severe disease linked to the antibody -dependent
   enhancement. In this work we propose a system of differential equations
   to model the impact of human migration on the spread of two serotypes of
   dengue virus between two regions where only one of the serotypes was
   initially present. When the individuals to the other region they can
   contract a different serotype. Using the next generation matrix method,
   the basic reproductive number R-0 is calculated and disease-free
   equilibrium stability is determined. In addition, conditions are
   obtained that guarantee the existence of an endemic equilibrium. These
   results provide conditions to predict an epidemic outbreak of dengue
   hemorrhagic due to a secondary infection of dengue.},

Abstract = {Given nonnegative integers, s and k, an (s, k)-polar partition of a
   graph G is a partition (A, B) of VG such that G{[}A] and (G{[}B]) over
   bar are complete multipartite graphs with at most s and k parts,
   respectively. If s or k is replaced by infinity, it means that there is
   no restriction on the number of parts of G{[}A] or (G{[}B]) over bar,
   respectively. A split graph is a graph admitting a (1, 1)-polar
   partition. A graph is said to be unipolar or monopolar if its vertex set
   admits an (infinity, infinity)-polar partition (A, B) such that A is a
   clique or an independent set, respectively.
   Naturally, most problems related to polar partitions are trivial on
   split graphs, even when some of them are very hard in general. In this
   work, we present some results related to polar partitions on two graph
   classes generalizing split graphs. Our main results include efficient
   algorithms to decide whether a graph on these classes admits such
   partitions, as well as upper bounds for the order of minimal (s,
   k)-polar obstructions on such graph families for any s and k (even if s
   or k is infinity). (C) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

   proper total k-coloring of G such that no pair of adjacent vertices has

Abstract = {In Tabasco, 699 freshwater algal taxa have been recognized, a number
   that we consider low, given that it protects the most significant number
   of water bodies in the country and, where the Pantanos de Centla
   Biosphere Reserve (RBPC) is located, the largest tropical wetland in the
   region, which due to its complex hydrology and biodiversity is one of
   the most important sites of Mesoamerica. The main objective of this
   study was to record and document phytoplankton species in El Viento and
   San Pedrito lagoons, located inside the RBPC, during 2 periods, northern
   rains (November 2016) and dry (February 2017). Sixty-seven species were
   documented, 4 of them recorded for Mexico for the first time, and 17 for
   the state: 67\% occur in eutrophicated aquatic systems, with a typically
   planktonic life form (73\%). The quantity and variety of aquatic bodies
   in the state, the location of the RBPC and the influence of the
   Grijalva-Usumacinta hydrological region, make remarkable the great
   diversity of algae and of photoautotrophic prokaryotes
   (Cyanoprokaryota).},

Title = {Five anti-inflammatory plant species of the Libellus de
   Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis from Mexico,1552: A botanical, chemical and
   pharmacological review},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {130},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis
   (Little Book of the Medicinal Herbs of the Indians) includes 185
   beautifully illustrated plants, 131 interpreted to species. Only some
   have been investigated regarding their attributed properties. Therefore,
   we selected six plants used as anti-inflammatories. The objectives of
   this work were to corroborate their botanical identity and to determine
   if contemporary chemical and pharmacological information supports their
   ancient therapeutic applications. Methods: The illustrations of the
   chosen plants were compared with specimens from the MEXU Herbarium to
   propose their possible taxonomic identity. The phytochemistry and
   anti-inflammatory activity of these species were reviewed in
   databases.Key results: The six plants selected from the Codex correspond
   to five species, since we consider that tetzmitl (Folium 13r) and
   texiyotl (Folium 22v) plants are the same species: Sedum dendroideum.
   Extracts from the leaves of S. dendroideum have shown anti-inflammatory
   activity in different pharmacological models due to derivatives of the
   flavonoid kaempferol, which supports its ancient medical applications to
   treat swollen face, eyes, and mouth. In Folium 48v, tzihuac copalli and
   tlacoecapatli are prescribed when ``the vein punctured by the phlebotomy
   swells.{''} We agree they are Bursera bipinnata and Litsea glaucescens,
   respectively. To date, their possible anti-inflammatory properties have
   not been investigated, but other related species do present these. The
   Folium 22v recommends tememetla and tequixquicacatl to relieve inflamed
   mouth. We corroborate that they are Echeveria gibbiflora and Distichlis
   spicata, respectively. These species do not have
   chemical-pharmacological studies. Conclusions: The bibliographic review
   suggests that anti-inflammatory properties attributed to S. dendroideum
   in the Codex have chemical and pharmacological support. Chemotax-onomic
   and pharmacological information suggests that B. bipinnata and L.
   glaucescens could bear these attributes and should be investigated
   experimentally. These three species are still used as anti-inflammatory
   in contemporary traditional medicine.},

   species described in 2009. Three individuals were characterised and
   collected in Santa Maria Mixistlan in the municipality Mixistlan de la
   Reforma in Oaxaca, Mexico. A complete taxonomic record was created
   including images of the complete life cycle and scanning electron
   microscopy of spines, epidermis, stoma and pollen. The phylogenetic
   hypothesis was performed with Bayesian Inference where some Mexican
   species are included, Opuntia chiangiana is recovered as an independent

Abstract = {During a search for parasites in fishes from Iguazu River, Argentina, a
   nymph of pentastomid was found encysted on mesenteries of Phalloceros
   harpagos. The 28S rDNA and COI mt-DNA were used to compare with the
   sequences deposited in the GenBank. Pentastomid nymphs belong to the
   subfamily Diesingiinae (Sebekidae) for having chloride cell pores
   distributed in a single row per annulus; also, the hooks and rows of
   spines of our material differ to other genera. Present specimens are
   most likely Diesingia sp., having 63-74 annuli, a U shaped oral cadre
   with fibers closing anteriorly and a peg like extension of the oral
   cadre. The 28S rDNA analysis places our samples into a sister group of
   Alofia sp., but the COI mt-DNA situate them on the base of the clade. In
   conclusion, our pentastomid positively belongs to Diesingia sp.,
   however, indisputable assignation requires a reliable description of the
   nymph, or the availability of sequences linking nymphs and adults, which
   even could provide evidence of a new hitherto undescribed genus.
   Aditionally, the systematic position of Sebekia oxycephala previously
   described by P. harpagos is discussed on the basis of our results,
   allowing us to suggest a re-assignation of such specimens to the genus
   Diesingia.},

Abstract = {IntroductionBiological systems respond to environmental disturbances and
   a wide range of compounds through complex gene interaction networks. The
   enormous growth of experimental information obtained using large-scale
   genomic techniques such as microarrays and RNA sequencing led to the
   construction of a wide variety of gene co-expression networks in recent
   years. These networks allow the discovery of clusters of co-expressed
   genes that potentially work in the same process linking them to
   biological processes often of interest to industrial, medicinal, and
   academic research. MethodsIn this study, we built the gene co-expression
   network of Ustilago maydis from the gene expression data of 168 samples
   belonging to 19 series, which correspond to the GPL3681 platform
   deposited in the NCBI using WGCNA software. This network was analyzed to
   identify clusters of co-expressed genes, gene hubs and Gene Ontology
   terms. Additionally, we identified relevant modules through a
   hypergeometric approach based on a predicted set of transcription
   factors and virulence genes. Results and DiscussionWe identified 13
   modules in the gene co-expression network of U. maydis. The TFs enriched
   in the modules of interest belong to the superfamilies of Nucleic
   acid-binding proteins, Winged helix DNA-binding, and Zn2/Cys6
   DNA-binding. On the other hand, the modules enriched with virulence
   genes were classified into diseases related to corn smut, Invasive
   candidiasis, among others. Finally, a large number of hypothetical, a
   large number of hypothetical genes were identified as highly
   co-expressed with virulence genes, making them possible experimental
   targets.},

Title = {Influence of bacterial biopolymers on physical properties of

Journal = {WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY \& BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article describes the consolidation effects of bacterial
   biopolymers synthesized by biofilm bacteria colonizing Mayan limestone
   buildings on the surface properties of limestone blocks, including
   disaggregation, hardness, and total color change at the laboratory
   level. The biopolymers evaluated, produced by bacterial isolates
   TM1B-488, TM1B-489, TM1B-349, and TM1B-464, influenced surface
   properties at different levels. 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis showed
   that isolate TM1B-349 was related with Psychrobacter sp. strain
   Marseille P-5312, TM1B-464 was related with Agrococcus terreus strain
   BT116, and isolates TM1B-488 and TM1B-489 were related with Xanthomonas
   citri pv. mangiferaeindicae strain XC01. Biopolymer A reduced the
   surface disaggregation of the material (26\%) compared to the untreated
   control, as revealed by the peeling test, followed by biopolymer B
   (10\%), while the remaining biopolymers had a negligible effect. The
   cactus biopolymer reduced disaggregation at higher levels (37\%). On the
   other hand, there was a similar concomitant increase in surface hardness
   of limestone samples coated with biopolymer A (34\%) and biopolymer B
   (32\%), higher than biopolymers C (10\%) and D (19\%). Total color
   change for all treatments was below the threshold value of 5, indicating
   a non-significant color alteration. Partial chemical characterization of
   best-performing biopolymer (A) suggests its probable glycoprotein
   nature, whose constitutive acidic monosaccharides probably contributed
   to higher adherence to the limestone surfaces, contributing to surface
   stabilization, hardening the surface, and decreasing surface decohesion.
   These preliminary findings suggest its potential application in
   bioconsolidants, but further studies are required.},

Title = {1H-NMR Metabolomics Profiling and Volatile Content of `Hoja

   in Mexico},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY \& BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The leaves of Piper auritum Kunth ('Hoja Santa') have been consumed for
   centuries by native people of central and southern Mexico as a fresh
   vegetable or condiment. Herein we present the result of the H-1-NMR
   metabolomics profiling of three accessions of P.auritum harvested in
   three different provinces of Mexico (Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Oaxaca). The
   volatile content associated with the flavoring properties of the plant
   was also determined by GC/MS. The non-targeted metabolome of these
   samples revealed that P.auritum is a source of free essential amino
   acids such as isoleucine, leucine, threonine, valine, histidine,
   phenylalanine, and tryptophan as well as organic acids, free
   monosaccharides, and valuable nutraceuticals such as trigonelline,
   Myo-inositol, betaine, and choline. Principal component analysis and
   orthogonal partial least squares discriminated analysis of the
   metabolites found in P.auritum revealed trigonelline as the main
   differential compound found in the three studied accessions, suggesting
   this metabolite as a possible chemical marker. According to these
   statistical approaches, 60\% of the differential metabolites were
   provided by Oaxaca samples, suggesting that leaves harvested in this
   province have better (p<0.05) nutritional properties than the other
   samples analyzed. Nevertheless, the high abundance of the anti-nutrient
   safrole (90\%) in the volatile fraction, advises the potential toxicity
   of P.auritum consumed in Oaxaca. On the other hand, samples harvested in
   the northern highlands of Puebla, contained the lowest levels of safrole
   (30\%) and acceptable levels of nutrients and nutraceuticals including
   choline. From the three groups of studied plants, those harvested in the
   northern highlands from Puebla, could be considered safer for human
   consumption than the other analyzed accessions.},

Abstract = {Stable isotopes have been used historically to track food webs. Our
   approach used a combination of delta C-13 and radiocarbon (C-14) dating
   to identify carbon sources in cave shrimp within caves of the Karstic
   Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Three sister species of stygobitic Typhlatya
   shrimps were collected from the cenote pool (cenote hereafter), cavern
   and cave hydro regions. New and previously reported C-14 and delta C-13
   values of whole tissues from the organisms were determined at the AMS
   laboratory (LEMA) of the Institute of Physics of the Universidad
   Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. This new set of isotopic values of biomass
   and potential sources were incorporated into the Bayesian Mixing
   Modeling Software SIAR. In two hypothetical scenarios, the contribution
   from each feeding source among three species of the Typhlatya genus was
   determined. Slight differences were also observed between isotopic
   values of two groups of the same species collected in two distant cenote
   pools, suggesting this species may feed on a wider array of sources than
   previously found, and that the oligotrophic environment may have a
   strong influence on cave shrimp diet.},

Abstract = {Mexico is the center of origin of maize and one of the phenomena that
   imperil maize conservation is transgene presence. Although previous
   studies have documented transgene presence in Mexican landraces, to date
   there is no countrywide transgene monitoring protocol, nor systematic
   analyses assessing which factors could be related with transgene
   presence and dispersal. In this work, we propose a geographically
   representative sampling protocol and present empirical data from three
   sampled states: Mexico City, Oaxaca and Chiapas. To further investigate
   which environmental and social variables could be associated with
   transgene presence, we carried out a data mining approach. To assess
   transgene presence in collected maize samples, we used Real-Time PCR,
   finding that transgenes were widely distributed across sampled
   localities: 33\% of the localities in Chiapas, 25\% in Mexico City and
   11\% in Oaxaca. The data mining approach allowed us to identify
   state-specific spatial associations in Chiapas and Oaxaca. In Chiapas, a
   higher probability of transgene presence appeared related to the
   coexistence of industrialized maize agriculture, while in Oaxaca it was
   related with seed exchange. We discuss the importance of implementing a
   national biomonitoring protocol to increase our understanding of the
   sources that enable transgene presence and dispersal.},

Abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic upended college and university instruction
   throughout the world, instructors were hard-pressed to find suitable
   alternatives for practical activities typically carried out outside of
   classrooms-in laboratories, workshops, clinics, and in the field. In
   response to this unanticipated challenge, they relied on their ingenuity
   to achieve pre-pandemic goals under pandemic conditions that
   necessitated the shift to online teaching. The Forensic Science
   Undergraduate Program housed in the School of Medicine of the National
   Autonomous University of Mexico was not exempt from this educational
   upheaval but, due to its interdisciplinary nature, required creating
   and/or adopting a wide range of activities capable of training students
   to perform practical tasks associated with subject areas that span the
   natural and social sciences, the humanities, and the law. This report
   aims to describe the approaches undertaken in three subjects (Forensic
   Entomology, Forensic Anthropology, and Hematology \& Serology) by
   interviewing instructors and examining their teaching materials. Also,
   through online surveys, students' reactions to these approaches were
   elicited to learn about their suitability and teaching potential.
   Instructor's experiences during the pandemic have proven to be a rich
   source of ingenious solutions, with implications well-beyond the current
   crisis, such as creating blended or fully online courses aimed at larger
   numbers of students, forensic and legal professionals, and even other
   instructors. The wide variety of forensic sciences offers the
   opportunity to innovate and improve the teaching and learning of
   science, particularly to the benefit of students that must combine their
   school tasks with professional and/or family duties.},

Title = {Genetic diversity, differentiation and phylogeography of the
   Stenocereus griseus (Haw.) Buxb. species complex (Cactaceae)},
Journal = {GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Genus Stenocereus (Cactaceae) is formed by about 23 species, most of
   them under different type and intensity of management, including forms
   of silvicultural management and cultivation. Some management types
   involve domestication processes; previous studies have demonstrated that
   management determines significant effect increasing frequency of
   phenotypes favorable to humans in silvicultural managed and cultivated
   populations. Effects of management on genetic variation have been
   documented to increase variation in some populations and to decrease in
   others, but its effect on genetic differentiation between wild and
   domesticated populations remains unclear. In this study, we evaluate the
   genetic variation of four species forming the Stenocereus griseus
   complex (SGSC), the differentiation among populations of species under
   different management and phylogeographic patterns of the complex. We
   analyzed population genetics through nine microsatellites and
   phylogeography by two nuclear regions. Genetic differentiation was
   higher within than among populations, management therefore accounting
   for low attributable variance. We identified a genetic spatial pattern
   of maximum genetic diversity in southern Mexico (Stenocereus pruinosus)
   dropping down to minimum values in Northern Mexico (S. huastecorum).
   Phylogeography showed a bottleneck in S. huastecorum and a close
   relationship between S. laevigatus and S. griseus. We found that genetic
   diversity and differentiation of the SGSC is associated to spatial
   factors rather than to management. The discordance between patterns of
   phenotypic differentiation previously reported and the low or null
   genetic differentiation can be explained because the neutral markers are
   not correlated with human selected traits. Use of NGS and genomic
   approaches could provide a different panorama of genetic variation and
   differentiation associated to management.},

Abstract = {Nematodes are among the most common parasites in aquatic mammals.
   Because of their cuticular covering, these worms are frequently
   collected from the examination of feces or stranded hosts. This work
   provides new records of three nematode taxa infecting three different
   aquatic mammal species (Lontra longicaudis annectens, Trichechus
   manatus, and Zalophus califomianus) in Mexico. Additionally, it brings
   together all available published records about this country's nematode
   fauna parasitizing aquatic mammals. The aim is to describe the current
   state of the art, which sets the basis for the strategic design of
   future research. Given the diversity of printed sources recording
   nematode fauna, we gathered literature, including theses and articles in
   journals profiled in the Journal Citation Reports or similar academic
   databases. The compiled information shows that 24 nominal nematode taxa
   have been reported from 11 species of aquatic mammals in Mexico. Our
   study exhibits irregular patterns of geographic distribution and host
   spectrum, existing entire marine ecoregions, and numerous host species
   lacking records.},

Abstract = {Phytochemical screening of an ethanol-water extract (EWE) from the bark
   of Croton guatemalensis led to the isolation and identification of eight
   compounds, among them: five entclerodane diterpenoids {[}junceic acid
   (1), 6(s)-acetoxy-15,16-diepoxy-ent-cleroda-3,13(16),14-trien-20oic acid

   three flavonoids {[}rutin (6), epicatechin (7), and quercetin (8)]. Of
   these, 2 and 3 are reported here for the first time. Structures were
   established through conventional spectroscopy methods and their absolute
   configurations were determined by optical rotation and comparison of
   experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and theoretical
   calculated ECD spectra. A suitable high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) method for quantifying rutin (6) was developed and
   validated according to standard protocols. Affinity-directed
   fractionation was used to identify possible in vitro active compounds on
   a-glucosidases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HPLC-ESI-MS was used to
   identify the inhibitors as free ligands after being released from the
   enzymatic complex by denaturing acidic conditions. The affinity studies
   led to the identification of ent-clerodane diterpenoids as active
   compounds. In silico analysis allowed us to determine the best
   conformational rearrangement for the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.},

Abstract = {Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite transmitted by the feces of triatomines.
   Many triatomine species are found in Mexico, and various T. cruzi
   variants have been isolated from these species, each showing very
   different virulence and cell tropism. The isolates were obtained from
   Meccus phyllosoma specimens in three localities in the state of Oaxaca,
   Mexico: Tehuantitla, Vixhana, and Guichivere. The virulence of each
   isolate was assessed by quantifying parasitemia, survival, and
   histopathologic findings. The lineage of each isolate was identified
   using the mini-exon gene. The expression of the tssa gene during
   infection was detected in the heart, esophagus, gastrocnemius, and
   brain. Our results show that the maximum post-infection parasitemia was
   higher for the Tehuantitla isolate. On genotyping, all isolates were
   identified as T. cruzi I. The amastigotes in the heart and gastrocnemius
   were verified for all isolates, but in the brain only for Tehuantitla
   and Vixhana. The tssa expression allowed us to detect T. cruzi isolates,
   for Tehuantitla, predominantly in the heart. For Vixhana, a higher tssa
   expression was detected in gastrocnemius, and for Guichivere, it was
   higher in the esophagus. Results show that virulence, tropism, and tssa
   expression can vary, even when the isolates are derived from the same
   vector species, in the same region, and at similar altitudes.},

Title = {Wood anatomy of 13 species from a successional tropical dry forest:
   description and ecological implications},

Abstract = {Successional tropical dry forest (TDF) species face water scarcity in
   the harsh dry season. Wood features provide insight into potential
   hydraulic stress coping mechanisms. Here, we describe the wood anatomy
   of 13 species occurring frequently in successional TDF. Given the marked
   rainfall seasonality of TDF, we expected these species to share
   conspicuous growth rings boundaries and drought-adapted anatomical
   features such as paratracheal parenchyma; although given the taxonomic
   and phenological diversity, a high wood diversity was also expected.
   Most species have diffuse-porosity. Axial parenchyma is diversely
   associated with vessels. Simple perforation plates are common and
   exclusive to all species. Different features poorly delimit growth
   boundaries, as previously observed in other tropical species. The main
   ground tissue is diverse, including nonseptate fibers, septate living
   fibers, or exclusively parenchyma. Axial and radial parenchyma may be
   scarce, abundant, or represent the main and unlignified ground tissue
   component. Vessel grouping ranges from solitary and 2-29 vessels per
   group. The mean vessel diameter range is <= 50-200 mu m; fiber walls are
   very thin to very thick. The anatomical features recorded among
   successional TDF species suggest different water stress coping
   mechanisms resulting from various anatomical combinations. Seven species
   exhibit wood features associated with drought tolerance (higher
   hydraulic redundancy, higher mechanical resistance, with vessel-ray
   connectivity likely given by banded parenchyma), whereas six species
   share xylem features associated with drought avoidance (taller and wider
   rays indicating higher water storage capacity). The complexity and
   multifunctionality of stem woody tissue should caution us against
   oversimplifying the relationship between anatomy, function, and
   ecological performance of TDF species.},

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},

Volume = {93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Testate amoebae are bioindicators sensitive to environmental change,
   which show good preservation in sediments of low pH environments, such
   as high mountain lakes (LAM). The presence and diversity of testate
   amoebae were documented in surface sediments and sediment cores, dated
   with Pb-210, from the only 2 LAMs in Mexico (El Sol and La Luna), which
   have shown signs of recent human-induced changes. A total of 18 taxa
   were recorded and the main species observed in both lakes were Difflugia
   glans ``glans{''} and D. globulosa. Specific richness and Shannon's
   diversity index were higher in Lake El Sol than in the smaller, acidic
   and ultraoligotrophic Lake La Luna. The sediment cores recorded changes,
   during the last 20 to 25 years, in the composition of the testate
   amoebae communities (El Sol) and in their dominance (La Luna), as well
   as increased accumulation rate and concentrations of iron and organic
   carbon. These are signs of anthropogenic impact on the lakes, which
   should alert us to improve protection measures for these unique
   ecosystems, not only at the local (crater) level, but also with a more
   regional perspective.},

Abstract = {In general, conventional superconductivity and magnetism are competing
   phenomena. In some alloys this competition is a function of the
   concentration of the elements. Here we show that in the palladium alloys
   Pd1-C (H/D/T)(C) (Pd-ides) the increase in the concentration c of the
   ides: hydrogen, deuterium, tritium (H/D/T), lowers the predicted
   magnetism of amorphous palladium (alpha-Pd) gradually, allowing
   superconductivity to appear for c approximate to 40\%. This magnetism
   explains why superconductivity does not manifest for smaller values of c
   (c <= 40\% in these Pd alloys. These results validate indirectly our
   predicted magnetism in the amorphous/porous palladium (a/p-Pd) providing
   a different strategy to explore the phase diagram of competing magnetic
   and superconducting phases.},

Title = {Organic-matter decomposition in urban stream and pond habitats},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Organic-matter decomposition is a key ecosystem process in freshwater
   ecosystems as it influences food web dynamics, represents a considerable
   flux in the global carbon cycle and can provide a useful measure of the
   `health' of freshwater habitats. While organic-matter decomposition has
   been well studied among lotic ecosystems, research from small standing
   waterbodies such as ponds is largely missing, and decomposition studies
   are usually conducted on a single freshwater habitat type. However,
   there is a need to consider ecosystem processes across multiple
   freshwater habitats and connected ecosystems to better characterise
   ecosystem functioning at the landscape-scale, given the interdependence
   of landscape elements. This study provides a comparative analysis of
   organic-matter decomposition using a standardised field assay
   (cotton-strip assay) in the water column, riparian zone and land zone of
   urban pond and stream habitats. The average daily tensile-strength loss
   of the cotton strips (a process that corresponds to the catabolism of
   cellulose by microbes) was significantly higher in the aquatic habitats
   than riparian and land zones when all sites were considered, and when
   stream and pond sites were considered separately. Furthermore, the
   average decomposition rate was significantly higher within the water
   column in river habitats compared to pond habitats, although no
   difference was observed among riparian and land zones. Woody debris had
   a negative unimodal association with average per day tensile strength
   loss within streams, and a positive unimodal association within pond
   sites. Both nitrate and shading had positive unimodal associations with
   average per day tensile strength loss within stream sites. Among pond
   habitat, urban land coverage within 250m of each site was identified to
   have a negative association with average per day tensile strength loss.
   Here we demonstrated that urban freshwater habitats have heterogeneous
   organic matter decomposition rates, and that the responses can be
   complex. Understanding key ecosystem processes at a multihabitat scale
   will ensure the effective inclusion of ecosystem process in freshwater
   assessment and conservation protocols and improve the health and
   resilience of urban freshwater ecosystems.},

Title = {Avoiding the effects of translocation on the estimates of the metabolic
   rates across an elevational gradient},

Abstract = {Body maintenance costs are often considered a proxy for performance in
   fitness traits. Maintenance energy requirements are measured as minimal
   metabolic rate of inactive, postabsorptive individuals in the
   laboratory. For mountain-dwelling species, translocation to the
   laboratory often means that they are also moved to another elevation.
   Due to physiological adaptations to local oxygen pressure, rapid
   elevational change can alter metabolic rate and translocation may result
   in erroneous estimates of body maintenance costs. In this study, we
   measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) of three populations of the
   Mesquite lizard (Sceloporus grammicus, Wiegmann 1828) at their native
   elevations (i.e., 2600, 3200 and 4100 m). Our results showed that at
   native elevations, mass specific RMR of lizards from the high elevation
   population (4100 m) did not differ from the RMR of the other populations
   (i.e., 2600 and 3200 m), whereas the lizards from the low elevation
   (2600 m) had lower RMR than those from the intermediate population.
   These results differ from a previous study in which the RMR of lizards
   from the same populations were reported to increase with native
   elevation when translocated and measured at an intermediate elevation.
   Hence, our results show that translocation in elevation can affect
   metabolic measures. We caution researchers that changes in elevation may
   preclude accurate measures of RMR in some animals and may therefore
   incorrectly predict performance of fitness-related traits.},

Abstract = {Three Pb-210-dated sediment cores were used to evaluate the
   contamination degree and flux ratios of potentially toxic elements
   (PTEs; As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) in seagrass meadows from the
   northern margin of Terminos Lagoon (TL), southern Gulf of Mexico. The
   sediments displayed minor Cd, Ni, V, and Zn enrichments but moderate to
   strong enrichment by As. Results from a chemometric analysis revealed
   that: 1) salinization and grain size, along with 2) the terrigenous
   inputs are the major factors influencing the PTEs accumulation. The
   historical trends of PTEs flux ratios nearly follow the large-scale
   land-use changes around TL, linked to the growth of the Mexican oil
   industry in the area since the 1970s. Our findings showed the critical
   role of seagrass meadows as PTEs sinks. This information is useful for
   decision-makers to develop restoration projects for a vulnerable site

Journal = {WAVE MOTION},

Volume = {114},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The propagation along a narrow duct of a shock wave generated by the
   rupture of a membrane is studied by means of visualization using the
   background oriented schlieren (BOS) method. This optical technique,
   which has not been used before in this context, is non-intrusive and can
   be employed to produce a two-dimensional quantitative portrait of the
   density field inside a section of the duct. Images obtained using a
   high-speed camera confirm that the shock is, as expected, planar, with
   boundary layer effects near the interior duct walls observed as well.
   The quantitative aspect of this method is validated by comparing the
   amplitude of the shock as obtained from images with direct measurements
   of the acoustic pressure acquired by means of a probe microphone.
   Successive images of the shock as it travels also permit calculation of
   the shock speed.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Resilient dragons: Exploring Odonata communities in an urbanization
   gradient},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cities function as ecological systems composed of a geosphere, a
   biosphere and an anthroposphere, interacting with each other and
   generating various selection pressures on urban organisms. Odonates
   (damselflies and dragonflies) are frequent inhabitants of urban areas,
   showing no clear or unique responses to urbanization. Thus, we defined
   an urbanization gradient using a habitat integrity index (HII)
   calculated for 19 sites in central Mexico, and investigated: a) changes
   in species richness and abundance along the urbanization gradient; and,
   b) the relationship between presence of waste of anthropic origin,
   chemical conditions of water, macrophyte cover, and odonate species
   richness, abundance and community composition. We analyzed the data for
   the whole odonate community, as well as for dragonfly and damselfly
   communities separately in each site. We found higher damselfly species
   richness and abundance in sites with low urbanization than in sites with
   high urbanization, and no differences in dragonfly communities along the
   gradient. We found a positive relationship between dragonfly species
   richness and abundance and waste percentage and macrophyte cover, and a
   negative relationship with dissolved solids in water. Our results
   indicated that odonate communities were fairly tolerant to urbanization
   and dragonflies were less affected than damselflies. However, we suggest
   that during design and restructuring of cities, the care and
   conservation of water bodies and all the life forms that inhabit there,
   be considered.},

Title = {On the unusual presence of a Quaternary peralkaline volcanic center,
   rear-arc region of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt eastern sector:
   geochemical and isotopic characterization of the Las Navajas-Hidalgo
   stratovolcano},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Quaternary Las Navajas-Hidalgo stratovolcano was constructed,
   between similar to 2.58 and similar to 2.2 Ma, by peralkaline rhyolites
   (comendites), with scarce quartz, sanidine, and plagioclase phenocrysts,
   emplaced similar to 120 km behind the volcanic front of the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt eastern sector. First, the peralkaline
   Pre-Collapse Event built a broad volcano (similar to 2.58 Ma ago) upon
   Miocene calc-alkaline dacites of the Sierra de Pachuca. Then, after a
   lateral-collapse explosion, the peralkaline Post-Collapse Event (similar
   to 2.2 Ma ago) produced pyroclastic deposits and glassy rhyolites.
   Besides, 22 mafic scoria cones with scarce olivine, clinopyroxene, and
   plagioclase phenocrysts, grouped in the Monogenetic Volcanic Event
   (similar to 2.58 and similar to 0.2 Ma), settled almost simultaneously
   with the stratovolcano. The trace-element patterns for the peralkaline
   rhyolites display enrichment of REE, HFSE, and Zr-Hf, but with highly
   negative Ba, Sr, P, Ti, and Eu anomalies that are not typical for
   subduction-related rocks. While mafic scoria cone samples lack negative
   HFSE anomalies relative to LILE, similar to OIB, except for their
   positive Sr, K, and Pb anomalies. Initial Sr and Nd isotopic values
   display a large range for peralkaline rhyolites suggesting some crustal
   interaction (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.70514-0.73093 and Nd-143/Nd-144 =
   0.51267-0.51271). While the Pb isotopes (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.80-18.92;
   Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.61-15.72 and (208)pb/Pb-204 38.63-38.99) indicate a
   Pb-207-rich reservoir (Paleozoic basement rocks). On the other hand, the
   Sr and Nd isotopic values for the mafic Monogenetic Volcanic Event rocks
   fall into the mantle array (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.70384-0.70534 and
   Nd-143/Nd-144 = 0.51270-0.51283), whereas the Pb isotopic (Pb-206/Pb-204
   = 18.72-18.84; Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.59-15.62 and Pb-208/Pb-204 =
   38.45-38.65) show a mixing line between a mantle-like component and
   radiogenic continental crust. The evidence suggests that the peralkaline
   rhyolites were formed through prolonged fractional crystallization
   processes in shallow reservoirs (similar to 5 kbars), and under
   water-undersaturated conditions (similar to 0.2\% water), from basaltic
   melts as those formed the Monogenetic Volcanic Event. These melts are
   probably related to the subduction slab rollback process that triggered
   asthenospheric components' upwelling towards the lithospheric mantle
   wedge and produced vulcanism in the rear-arc region.},

Title = {Oriented expressions of graph properties},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Several graph properties are characterized as a class of graphs that
   admit an orientation avoiding a finite set of oriented structures. For
   instance, if Fk is the set of homomorphic images of the directed path on
   k + 1 vertices, then a graph is k-colourable if and only if it admits an
   orientation with no induced oriented subgraph in Fk. There is a
   fundamental question underlying this kind of characterizations: Given a
   graph property P, is there a finite set of oriented graphs F such that a
   graph belongs to P if and only if it admits an orientation with no
   induced oriented subgraph in F? We address this question by exhibiting
   some necessary conditions upon certain graph classes for them to admit
   such a characterization. Consequently, we exhibit an uncountable family
   of hereditary classes for which no such finite set exists. In
   particular, the class of graphs with no holes of prime length belongs to
   this family. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the morphometric variation of wing mite Periglischrus
   paracaligus Herrin and Tipton, along with the distribution of their host
   Leptonycteris yerbabuenae Martinez and Villa, in Mexico. A total of 115
   female and 96 male specimens of P. paracaligus were used to conduct
   linear and geometric morphometric analyses. We assessed the influence of
   the geographic distribution of the migratory and nonmigratory
   populations of its bat host species on changes in size and shape on
   these parasites. Both analyses revealed high intraspecific variation in
   P. paracaligus, but subtle geographic differentiation. None of the
   approaches used identified a consistent pattern that separates
   unambiguously migratory from nonmigratory populations. Females presented
   more phenotypic variation than males and UPGMA analyses showed southern
   and northern colonies grouped in two distinct clades. Males on the other
   hand showed randomly grouped colonies with no geographic concordance.
   Interestingly, the most differentiated colony was the north Pacific
   colony of Jalisco. For both, males and females, isolation by distance
   (IBD) was not observed. We discuss these results as a possible scenario
   of contact between migratory populations located in northern Mexico with
   nonmigratory populations in other localities in central and southern
   Mexico conforming to a panmictic population along with their
   distribution range.},

Title = {Mating systems in a natural hybrid of Cephalocereus (Cactaceae)
   and comparative seed germination},

Abstract = {The Cactaceae family has a strong predisposition for hybridization,
   which is a mechanism suggested to be relevant to its evolution. However,
   a few studies evidence the consequences of hybridization in members of
   this family. A population of Cephalocereus columna-trajani x C. tetetzo
   cohabits with both parental species in the Tehuac ` an-Cuicatl ` an
   Reserve, Mexico. A comparative analysis was conducted between these
   three taxa with three principal aims: a) determine, through in situ
   experiments, the mating system of a hybrid taxon; b) compare seed
   morphology; and c) evaluate seed germination under controlled
   conditions. Our results show that the mating success was higher between
   hybrid individuals than between hybrids and C. tetetzo members. The
   hybrid seed showed the typical morphology of the tribe Pachycereeae but
   was statistically smaller than the seed of C. columna-trajani. Under
   white and red light the total germination percentage of hybrid seeds was
   higher than that of both parental species, which was interpreted as
   hybrid vigor. In summary, the successful mating between individuals
   preceding the formation of viable seeds with better germination capacity
   than both parental species is evidence of the reproductive success of
   hybrids, disproving their sterility and challenging the view that the
   hybrid taxon represents an ``evolutionary endpoint{''}.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Climate change represents a problem that generates
   long-term impacts and is considered a threat to the conservation of many
   species. Objective: To evaluate the impact of climate change on the
   distribution areas of 10 trees species characteristic of cloud forests
   in the state of Oaxaca. Materials and methods: The impact was evaluated
   for two-time horizons (2050 and 2080) and two emission scenarios (RCP
   4.5 and 8.5) under the Had GEM2-ES general atmospheric circulation
   model. Current and future distribution was modeled with MaxEnt. The
   distribution of Carpinus tropicalis, Juglans pyriformis, Liquidambar
   styraciflua, Litsea glaucescens, Magnolia dealbata, Magnolia schiedeana,
   Ostrya virginiana, Symplocos coccinea, Zinowiewia concinna and Taxus
   globosa were obtained from the herbarium specimen review. Results and
   discussion: In RCP 4.5, J. pyriformis, L. styraciflua, L. glaucescens
   and S. coccinea increased (2.8 \% to 20.5 \%) their area of
   distribution. In this scenario, the rest of the species reduced their
   area by up to 30 \% compared to the current distribution. In RCP
   8.5-2050, J. pyriformis and O. virginiana had a gain of more than 5 \%.
   All species showed a reduction greater than 10 \% under the RCP 8.52080
   scenario. The models showed area under the curve greater than 0.8 and
   partial ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) greater than 1.7.
   Conclusions: Understanding the response of 10 species to climate change
   will serve as a basis for proposing conservation and monitoring plans,
   since nine of them are in some category of risk.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study Algorithmic High-Frequency Financial Markets as
   dynamical networks. After an individual analysis of 24 stocks of the US
   market during a trading year of fully automated transactions by means of
   ordinal pattern series, we define an information-theoretic measure of
   pairwise synchronization for time series which allows us to study this
   subset of the US market as a dynamical network. We apply to the
   resulting network a couple of clustering algorithms in order to detect
   collective market states, characterized by their degree of centralized
   or decentralized synchronicity. This collective analysis has shown to
   reproduce, classify and explain the anomalous behavior previously
   observed at the individual level. We also find two whole coherent
   seasons of highly centralized and decentralized synchronicity,
   respectively. Finally, we model these states dynamics through a simple
   Markov model. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On the relationship between environmental suitability and habitat use

Abstract = {Recent studies have used occupancy models (OM) and ecological niche
   models (ENM) to provide a better understanding of species' distributions
   at different scales. One of the main ideas underlying the theoretical
   foundations of both OM and ENM is that they are positively related to
   abundance: higher occupancy implies higher density and more suitable
   areas are likely to have more abundant populations. Here, we analyze the
   relationship between habitat use measured in terms of occupancy
   probabilities from OM and environmental suitability derived from ENM in
   three different Neotropical mammal species: Leopardus wiedii, Cuniculus
   paca, and Dasypus novemcinctus. For ENM, we used climatic and vegetation
   cover variables and implemented a model calibration and selection
   protocol to select the most competitive models. For OM, we used a
   single-species, single-season model with site covariates for camera-trap
   data from six different sites throughout the Neotropical realm.
   Covariates included vegetation percentage, normalized difference
   vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and elevation. For
   each site, we fit OM using all possible combinations of variables and
   selected the most competitive (Delta AICc < 2) to build an average OM.
   We explored relationships between estimated suitability and occupancy
   values using Spearman correlation analysis. Relationships between ENM
   and OM tended to be positive for the three Neotropical mammals, but the
   strength varied among sites, which could be explained by local factors
   such as site characteristics and conservation status of areas. We
   conjecture that ENM are suitable to understand spatial patterns at
   coarser geographic scales because the concept of the niche is about the
   species as a whole, whereas OM are more relevant to explain the
   distribution locally, likely reflecting transient dynamics of
   populations resulting from many local factors such as community
   composition and biotic processes.},

Abstract = {Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of spreading, pinching, and
   coalescence of drops is critically important for a diverse range of
   applications involving spraying, printing, coating, dispensing,
   emulsification, and atomization. Hence experimental studies visualize
   and characterize the increase in size over time for drops spreading over
   substrates, or liquid bridges between coalescing drops, or the decrease
   in the radius of pinching necks during drop formation. Even for
   Newtonian fluids, the interplay of inertial, viscous, and capillary
   stresses can lead to a number of scaling laws, with three limiting
   self-similar cases: visco-inertial (VI), visco-capillary (VC) and
   inertio-capillary (IC). Though experiments are presented as examples of
   the methods of dimensional analysis, the lack of precise values or
   estimates for pre-factors, transitions, and scaling exponents presents
   difficulties for quantitative analysis and material characterization. In
   this tutorial review, we reanalyze and summarize an elaborate set of
   landmark published experimental studies on a wide range of Newtonian
   fluids. We show that moving beyond VI, VC, and IC units in favor of
   intrinsic timescale and lengthscale determined by all three material
   properties (viscosity, surface tension and density), creates a
   complementary system that we call the Ohnesorge units. We find that in

Abstract = {Cretaceous carbonate deposits are widely distributed along the Sierra
   Madre Oriental thrust belt from northern Veracruz to south-ern Nuevo
   Leon. At Cerro Boludo (Hidalgo), dark marly limestone samples were
   collected from the ``Otates Horizon{''}. The samples include a
   well-preserved planktic foraminiferal assemblage com-posed of
   Globigerinelloides algerianus Cushman and ten Dam, 1948,
   Globigerinelloides ferreolensis (Moullade, 1961), Globigerinelloides
   barri (Bolli, Loeblich and Tappan, 1957), Globigerinelloides aptiensis
   Longoria, 1974, Globigerinelloides blowi (Bolli, 1959), Hedbergella
   roblesae (Obregon de la Parra, 1959), H. occulta Longoria, 1974, H.

   cheniourensis (Sigal, 1952) and Schackoina cenomana Schacko, 1897.
   Radiolarians are also present. Based on the planktic foraminiferal
   assemblage we recognized the Globigerinelloides algerianus Total Range
   Zone of early late to middle late Aptian age. The paleonvironmental
   reconstruction inferred from the lithology and the foraminiferal
   association suggests an open pelagic deposit, besides the occurrence of
   pyrite framboids and the organic matter indicate oxygen-depleted
   conditions in a meso to eutrophic setting probably linked to the ``late
   Aptian anoxic event{''}.},

Abstract = {In this work, microwave frequency measurement (MFM) is reviewed since
   the early stages using fully analog implementations, including its
   evolution to analog/digital implementations with high resolutions up to
   1 MHz. The review includes fully digital implementations and microwave
   photonics techniques, with a discussion on achieved devices and the
   overall field of measuring and identifying unknown signals. Several
   microwave planar devices such as interferometers, filters, and frequency
   selective surfaces have been proposed to design low-cost and low-power
   digital MFM systems. The planar devices presented here show resolutions
   from 1 MHz to 940 MHz and operate in the frequency range from 0.15 GHz
   to 11.5 GHz, having typical bandwidths from 1 GHz to 2 GHz. MFM using
   microwave photonics techniques involve mapping the microwave signal into
   the optical spectrum to create a frequency-power function, that uniquely
   identifies the frequency of the unknown signal, with large bandwidths
   and immunity to electromagnetic interference.},

   manifold has k equal principal curvatures at each point. We study
   conditions under which a Lorentzian manifold admits a foliation by such
   hypersurfaces. Originally motivated by the existence of particular
   foliations of the Schwarzschild black hole, we extend our theory to the
   class of manifolds given as doubly warped products. The key ingredient
   for our study is a new class of vector fields which includes conformal
   vector fields. After obtaining general results about manifolds admitting
   such kind of vector fields, we give a characterization of the
   Schwarzschild black hole in the class of Lorentzian manifolds admitting
   a pair of such vector fields and satisfying some boundary conditions.},

Title = {Even more oak species in Mexico? Genetic structure and morphological

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Differentiation among populations, sometimes despite ongoing gene
   exchange, is a key step in speciation. Therefore, comparison of intra-
   and interspecific differentiation patterns is of great significance to
   understanding speciation. The genus Quercus is an interesting system to
   test speciation models in the presence of gene flow, due to its weak
   interspecific reproductive barriers. The aim of the present study was to
   characterize the degree and pattern of morphological and genetic
   differentiation among different morphotypes in the white oak Quercus
   laeta, some corresponding to the previously described species Quercus
   centralis, Q. laeta, Quercus prinopsis, and Quercus transmontana, as
   well as geographically structured variation within Q. transmontana not
   described previously. Our goal was to evaluate if some of these can be
   considered distinct specific entities or are rather part of a continuum
   of variation. Nine microsatellite loci and two intergenic regions of
   chloroplast DNA were analyzed. Morphological differences were evaluated
   using geometric morphometrics. Chloroplast DNA showed low
   differentiation, suggesting introgression or sharing of ancestral
   haplotypes among the Q. laeta morphotypes. Nuclear microsatellites
   indicated differentiation into two distinct main genetic groups, which
   were congruent with morphological differentiation. In conclusion,
   nuclear markers and morphological variations suggest the existence of at
   least two different entities within Q. laeta.},

Title = {Prescriptions for the Control of a Clonal Invasive Species Using
   Demographic Models},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Until recently, little research has focused on determination of the
   population dynamics of invasive species and evaluating their genetic
   variation. Consequently, not much is known of what drives clonal
   invasive species and their demography. Here, we describe the population
   dynamics of Kalanchoe delagoensis (Crassulaceae), considered invasive to
   several countries. We quantified the demography of a population in
   central Mexico using integral projection models (IPM) in a population
   that reproduced asexually exclusively through plantlets. The effect of
   clonal recruitment on population growth rate (lambda) was evaluated by
   changing plantlet survival and simulating management scenarios that used
   previous data of watering and seven experimental herbicide treatments.
   The finite rate of population increase indicated that this Kalanchoe
   delagoensis population is growing (above one) and with water
   availability, growth rates will only accelerate. The IPM showed that
   plantlet survival and recruitment were the most critical steps in the
   cycle for the population, and simulations of different management
   scenarios showed that reducing plantlet survival significantly decreased
   lambda only in two out of the seven herbicides used.},

Title = {Floral biology of two woody species of Dalbergia at high risk of
   timber extraction},
Journal = {BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {743-753},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Dalbergia granadillo Pittier and D. stevensonii Standl. are two
   important native timber-yielding forest tree legume species, the first
   distributed along the Pacific coast of Mexico and southwestern Mexico,
   and the other in southwestern Mexico. Both are threatened by illegal
   trade, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation. To generate information
   to help improve their conservation status, we studied several aspects of
   their reproductive ecology: reproductive phenology, floral morphology,
   floral rewards, and pollinators. Reproductive phenology was studied by
   monitoring trees from flowering to fruiting. Floral morphometrics was
   used to describe floral morphology and infer the mating strategy using a
   morphological approach (pollen-ovule ratio, herkogamy, flower size).
   Pollinators were determined by capturing insects and observing insect
   behavior on flowers. Results showed that flowering in both species was
   synchronous and massive. A high rate of early flower abortion was
   documented in both species. Both species have small, numerous, whitish,
   and fragrant flowers, typical of Dalbergia. Pollen-ovule ratios and
   floral traits suggest that outcrossing is favored. Floral visitors are
   insects, but only bees manipulate flowers when looking for rewards, a
   behavior that permits pollination. The two Dalbergia species apparently
   depend on bees for successful reproduction. The most critical
   reproductive bottleneck was a meager fruiting success probably due to
   either the lack of compatible individuals for outcrossing or high rates
   of fruit abortion. The regeneration of populations of these slow-growing
   Dalbergia species depends on a suitable quantity of seeds, which is
   severely limited by the overharvesting of mature, reproductive
   individuals for the timber trade.},

Title = {Dormancy and viability of Ferocactus peninsulae (Cactaceae) seeds},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-181},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Knowledge on seed dormancy is crucial for the understanding of plant
   population dynamics, as it controls seed germination and seed bank
   formation. Dormant seeds have high potential to establish in soil seed
   banks, but such information within Cactaceae is scarce, although it is
   essential for conservation programs. The aim of this study was to
   determine if seeds of Ferocactus peninsulae showed any kind of dormancy
   and to test their germination capacity after storage. This was assessed
   with 15 seed sowing experiments done over 4 years with seeds stored
   under room conditions (20 +/- 2 degrees C). We demonstrated the
   existence of physiological dormancy in F. peninsulae seeds that is
   broken with an after-ripening period. Germination was low during the
   first 3 months of storage (d = 0.206) but increased after 10 months of
   storage (d = 0.654), and seeds maintained their viability at 48 months
   (d = 0.707). Also, their speed of germination increased with storage
   time. Ferocactus peninsulae seeds are positively photoblastic, and the
   requirement for light for germination persisted over all experiments.
   The results provide crucial information for propagation and conservation
   research and may allow us to infer that F. peninsulae seeds are able to
   form a persistent soil seed bank, as they maintained their viability
   after dormancy is released.},

   proposal of aquatic bioindicators for peri-urban rivers},
Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We assessed macroalgal responses to anthropogenic pressures in the Basin
   of Mexico to examine whether these biological indicators exhibited a
   discriminatory and explanatory correlation with ecological quality and
   propose the ``Macroalgae Ecological Quality Index{''} (MEQI). The
   proposal included 3 steps: i) characterization of trophic level and
   hydromorphological quality (HQ) in 13 sub-basins consisting of 49 sites
   with different degrees of conservation sampled between 2012 and 2016,
   ii) calculation of indicator values for 20 taxa to generate the proposed
   algorithm, and iii) validation of the algorithm in 26 new sites and
   calculation of its correlation with water quality and HQ. The ecological
   quality gradient to which the macroalgae responded was related to oxygen
   saturation, soluble reactive phosphorus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen,
   and hydromorphological quality. By assigning an indicator value to each
   group of species, we calculated the MEQI using the formula adapted from
   Pantle and Buck, indicating 5 different ecological quality classes. The
   MEQI index allowed us to establish references for good quality sites and
   altered sites with regards to chemical composition and structure.
   Therefore, the MEQI is recommended for biomonitoring in the Basin of
   Mexico and registering multiple environmental stressors.},

Title = {First ecological analysis of lacustrine testate amoebae in Guatemala: A
   case study from the highland Lake Chichoj},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Abstract = {Freshwater quality represents a central issue for human populations and
   the conservation of aquatic communities. In this sense, freshwater
   reservoirs, such as lakes, require proper management and monitoring
   plans to avoid their deterioration and pollution. Bioindicators, such as
   testate amoebae, are an excellent tool increasingly utilized for
   limnology and paleolimnology to assess the trophic status of lacustrine
   environments. However, despite their potential as bioindicators, the
   ecological research status of testate amoebae in Central American lakes
   remains poor. We conducted our research at highland Lake Chichoj, Alta
   Verapaz, Guatemala, which has become increasingly eutrophic since the
   1980s. This study contributes to fill the knowledge gap about
   neotropical testate amoebae, parallel to testing their utility as
   bioindicators of lacustrine conditions. From a collection of 12 surface
   sediment samples (associated with different land uses), we found 19
   testate amoebae taxa, and for the first time in Guatemala, we recorded
   Arcella megastoma, Arcella gibbosa, Cucurbitella tricuspis, Difflugia
   protaeiformis strain ``acuminata{''}, Difflugia urceolata strain
   ``elongata{''}, Lesquereusia spiralis, Lesquereusia modesta, and
   Mediolus corona. Our cluster analyses revealed three testate amoebae
   assemblages in connection to trophic conditions: 1) Stressed Conditions
   (SC), 2) Lowest Contamination Conditions (LC), and 3) Deep Transitional
   Conditions Assemblage (DT). After performing a transformation-based
   redundancy analysis (tb-RDA), we found total organic carbon as the only
   significant environmental parameter associated with testate amoebae
   assemblages (p<0.004). Our indicator species analysis (IndVal) confirms
   the eutrophic regime of Lake Chichoj in connection to the presence of
   Cucurbitella tricuspis and Centropyxis aculeata strain ``aculeata{''} as
   indicators of nutrient enrichment and stressful conditions. The testate
   amoebae assemblages identified in Lake Chichoj represent a critical
   baseline for future studies of Guatemalan lakes, strengthening our
   understanding of the causal factors behind water quality in neotropical
   regions.},

Abstract = {We report the first description and analysis of a distress stridulation
   emitted by a male Acanthinodera cumingii (Hope 1833), produced under the
   context of an indirect disturbance. We evaluated the temporal and
   spectral properties of the stridulation using digital processing
   software. The results of the variables studied indicate that the sound
   is in audible ranges for conspecifics and potential predators. We
   discuss the potential ecological significance of the use of this
   distress call and how it might relate to its environment.},

Title = {Notes on weak-odd edge colorings of digraphs},
Journal = {ARS MATHEMATICA CONTEMPORANEA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {A weak-odd edge coloring of a general digraph D is a (not necessarily
   proper) coloring of its edges such that for each vertex v is an element
   of V (D) at least one color c satisfies the following conditions: if
   d(D)(-)(v) > 0 then c appears an odd number of times on the incoming
   edges at v; and if d(D)(+)(v) > 0 then c appears an odd number of times
   on the outgoing edges at v. The minimum number of colors sufficient for
   a weak-odd edge coloring of D is the weak-odd chromatic index, denoted
   chi'(wo)(D). It is known that chi'(wo) (D) <= 3 for every digraph D, and
   that the bound is sharp. In this article we show that the weak-odd
   chromatic index can be determined in polynomial time. Restricting to
   edge colorings of D with at most two colors, the minimum number of
   vertices v is an element of V (D) for which no color c satisfies the
   above conditions is the defect of D, denoted def(D). Surprisingly, it
   turns out that the problem of determining the defect of digraphs is
   (polynomially) equivalent to the problem of finding the matching number
   of simple graphs. Moreover, we characterize the classes of associated
   digraphs and tournaments in terms of the weak-odd chromatic index and
   the defect.},

Abstract = {For the collection of C-bounded subsets of X (usually called bounded),

   X, TCb;u is the topology of the uniform convergence on the C-bounded

   studied, where now what the symbols T-(Cb) over bar ,T-u and T-(Cb) over

   contained in the topology of uniform convergence on X, T-u, if and only

   pseudocompact and each element in (Cb) over bar is a C-compact subset of
   X, then T-(Cb) over bar = T-u subset of T-Cb, and, moreover, if there is
   an element in Cb which is not C-compact, then T-u not equal subset of
   T-Cb; (4) For a normal pseudocompact space X, (C(X); T-(Cb) over bar) is
   metrizable if and only if it is a q-space.},

Abstract = {We extend the classical notion of standardly stratified k-algebra
   (stated for finite dimensional k-algebras) to the more general class of
   rings, possibly without 1, with enough idempotents. We show that many of
   the fundamental results, which are known for classical standardly
   stratified algebras, can be generalized to this context. Furthermore,
   new classes of rings appear as: ideally standardly stratified and
   ideally quasi-hereditary. In the classical theory, it is known that
   quasi-hereditary and ideally quasi-hereditary algebras are equivalent
   notions, but in our general setting, this is no longer true. To develop
   the theory, we use the well-known connection between rings with enough
   idempotents and skeletally small categories (ringoids or rings with
   several objects).},

Journal = {GEOSPATIAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},
Abstract = {A spatio-temporal analysis of the first wave of the coronavirus
   (COVID-19) pandemic in Mexico (April to September 2020) was performed by
   state. Descriptive analyses through diagrams, map-ping, animations and
   time series representations were carried out. Greater risks were
   observed at certain times in specific regions. Various trends and
   clusters were observed and analysed by fitting linear mixed models and
   time series clustering. The association of co-morbidities and other
   variables were studied by fitting a spatial panel data linear model
   (SPLM). On average, the greatest risks were observed in Baja California
   Norte, Chiapas and Sonora, while some other densely populated states,
   e.g., Mexico City, had lower values. The trends varied by state and a
   four-order polyno-mial, including fixed and random effects, was
   necessary to model them. The most common risk development was observed
   in states belonging to two clusters and consisted of an initial increase
   fol-lowed by a decrease. Some states presented cluster configurations
   with a retarded risk increase before the decrease, while the risk
   increased throughout the time of study in others. A cyclic behaviour
   with a second increasing trend was also observed in some states. The
   SPLM approach revealed a positive significant association with respect
   to case fatality risk between certain groups, such as males and
   individuals aged 50 years and more, and the prevalence of chronic kidney
   disease, cardiovascular disease, asthma and hypertension. The analysis
   may provide valuable insight into COVID-19 dynamics applicable in future
   outbreaks, as well as identify determinants signifying certain trends at
   the state level. The combination of spatial and temporal information may
   provide a better understanding of the fatalities due to COVID-19.},

Title = {ANAMMOX MICROBIAL ACTIVITY IN SODIUM SALINE SOIL OF FORMER LAKE TEXCOCO,
   MEXICO},
Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {27-35},
Abstract = {The Anammox process, involving transformation of ammonium to dinitrogen,
   is well known in aquatic ecosystems. However, this anaerobic process in
   soil has been little explored, even less in extremophile soils. The
   saline-sodic soil of the former Lake Texcoco exposed to desertification
   with irrigation projects using wastewater of Mexico City, is a unique
   environment, yet little is known about its microbial ecology. The
   objective of this study was to examine the presence of Anammox
   microorganisms and their microcosm activity after a period of Anammox
   enrichment (229 days). Microcosm kinetics monitored after the 229 days
   enrichment experiment, showed a significant removal of ammonium and
   nitrite, with a significant production of dinitrogen. The stoichiometric
   conversion of NO2- and NH4+ to N-2 gas is complete in the studied soils,
   based on an Anammox process where 1 mole of NH4+ resulted in 1.02 moles
   of N-2. The presence of the Anammox functional gene hzoA was observed in
   saline-sodic soils of the former Lake Texcoco. The Anamx1 and Anamx2
   operational taxonomic units (OTU) are phylogenetically close to a
   bacterium of the phylum Planctomycetes from a wastewater treatment

Abstract = {Sodium-magnesium-borotellurite glasses doped with 0.05, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5
   mol\% of Dy2O3 (BTNMxD, x = 0.05, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) were synthetized by
   the melting quenching method. A spectroscopic investigation of BTNMxD
   glasses was focused to obtain the main radiative properties of yellow
   laser application and photometric properties of WLED application. The
   BTNM1.0D glass excited at 386 nm could be more feasible of obtaining
   yellow laser emission, since its stimulated emission peak cross section
   is the highest one among the BTNMxD glasses. The decay time of the
   yellow emission (572 nm) decreases from 0.639 to 0.429 ms with increase
   of dysprosium content, as consequence of an increment of energy
   migration between Dy3+ ions via cross-relaxation processes. Such energy
   migration could be dominated by electric dipole-dipole interaction. The
   CIE1931 color coordinates of the overall emission from the BTNMxD
   glasses excited at 386 nm are into the neutral white region with a
   correlated color temperature in the 4311-4682 K range.},

Title = {Addition of a carboxy-terminal tail to the normally tailless
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor impairs fertility in female mice},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the primary neuropeptide
   controlling reproduction in vertebrates. GnRH stimulates
   follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)
   synthesis via a G-protein-coupled receptor, GnRHR, in the pituitary
   gland. In mammals, GnRHR lacks a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Ctail) and
   does not exhibit homologous desensitization. This might be an
   evolutionary adaptation that enables LH surge generation and ovulation.
   To test this idea, we fused the chicken GnRHR Ctail to the endogenous
   murine GnRHR in a transgenic model. The LH surge was blunted, but not
   blocked in these mice. In contrast, they showed reductions in FSH
   production, ovarian follicle development, and fertility. Addition of the
   Ctail altered the nature of agonist-induced calcium signaling required
   for normal FSH production. The loss of the GnRHR Ctail during mammalian
   evolution is unlikely to have conferred a selective advantage by
   enabling the LH surge. The adaptive significance of this specialization
   remains to be determined.},

Abstract = {Gelidium pusillum is a species reported from the northern Gulf of
   California to the tropical region of the Mexican Pacific, but there is
   wide morphological variation among populations. The objective of this
   research was to evaluate of the Mexican species using morphological and
   molecular approaches, with the markers rbcL and COI-5P. This study
   examined 12 samples from four sites in the Mexican tropical Pacific.
   Phylogenetic analyses resolved these specimens within two clades
   separated from the topotype material of G. pusillum. The main
   morphological differences with other Mexican and phylogenetic closely
   related species were size, branching pattern, branching order,
   distribution of internal rhizoidal filaments, and shape of the
   tetrasporangial sori. The sequence divergences between these clades and
   the morphological differences support their representing distinct
   species so that Gelidium nayaritense sp. nov. is proposed for tropical
   specimens of the Mexican Pacific, whose diagnostic characteristics are
   the little or absent branching, its small size, as well as the presence
   of internal rhizoidal filaments concentrated in the subcortex, further
   G. sanyaense is register for first time from Mexico and Eastern Pacific.},

Journal = {GEO-MARINE LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A marine sediment core located off the southernmost part of the Baja
   California Peninsula, NE Pacific, is analyzed to investigate a submarine
   mass failure. We examine the lithofacies and sedimentary structures, the
   total organic (TOC) and inorganic (TIC) carbon, the grain size
   composition, and the degree of fragmentation in foraminifera tests. The
   core BB03 consists of five lithostratigraphic units, from bottom to top,
   U1 to U5. Radiocarbon dating (AMS C-14) indicates that this sequence is
   inverted, where the deepest strata U1-U2 date at similar to 4,162 cal yr
   BP, U3-U4 at similar to 14,406 cal yr BP, and the shallower strata U5 at
   similar to 18,759-19,445 cal yr BP. Analysis of core and multibeam
   bathymetric data evidenced a submarine mass failure of the slump type,
   characterized by abruptly inverted layers with soft-sediment deformation
   structures. The event's timing is constrained both with AMS C-14 and the
   well-known stratigraphic identification of laminated or bioturbated
   layers in this highly productive upwelling zone. The event occurred
   during the Late Holocene as constrained by a maximum age of similar to
   4,000 years. Although there is no explicit evidence on the cause of the
   submarine slump, the geomorphic characteristics and the close spatial
   connection with other submarine mass failures suggest a close
   relationship with the Tosco-Abreojos fault having acted either as a
   preconditioning factor or as a triggering mechanism. Finally, this study
   represents one of the few studies of submarine mass failures at the NE
   Tropical Pacific margin, aiming to identify how the transported
   sediments interact with the regional morphology and the formation of
   modern seafloor structures.},

Abstract = {The search for molecules that contribute to the relief of pain is a
   field of research in constant development. Lamiaceae is one of the most
   recognized families world-wide for its use in traditional medicine to
   treat diseases that include pain and inflammation. Mexico can be
   considered one of the most important centers of diversification, and due
   to the high endemism of this family, it is crucial for the in situ
   conservation of this family. Information about the most common genera
   and species found in this country and their uses in folk medicine are
   scarcely reported in the literature. After an extensive inspection in
   bibliographic databases, mainly Sciencedirect, Pubmed and Springer,
   almost 1200 articles describing aspects of Lamiaceae were found;
   however, 217 articles were selected because they recognize the Mexican
   genera and species with antinociceptive and/or anti-inflammatory
   potential to relieve pain, such as Salvia and Agastache. The bioactive
   constituents of these genera were mainly terpenes (volatile and
   non-volatile) and phenolic compounds such as flavonoids (glycosides and
   aglycone). The aim of this review is to analyze important aspects of
   Mexican genera of Lamiaceae, scarcely explored as a potential source of
   secondary metabolites responsible for the analgesic and
   anti-inflammatory properties of these species. In addition, we point out
   the possible mechanisms of action involved and the modulatory pathways
   investigated in different experimental models. As a result of this
   review, it is important to mention that scarce information has been
   reported regarding species of this family from Mexican genera. In fact,
   despite Calosphace being one of the largest subgenera of Salvia in the
   world, found mainly in Mexico, it has been barely investigated regarding
   its potential biological activities and recognized bioactive
   constituents. The scientific evidence regarding the different bioactive
   constituents found in species of Lamiaceae demonstrates that several
   species require further investigation in preclinical studies, and of
   course also in controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and
   safety of these natural products to support their therapeutic potential
   in pain relief and/or inflammation, among other health conditions. Since
   Mexico is one of the most important centers of diversification, and due
   to the high endemism of species of this family, it is crucial their
   rescue, in situ conservation, and investigation of their health
   benefits.},

Abstract = {The Cretaceous chaetetid sponge Acanthochaetetes huauclillensis
   Sanchez-Beristain and Garcia-Barrera is reported for the first time from
   the Aptian-Cenomanian Khalsi Formation, Ladakh Himalaya, India. Its low-
   to high-domical growth form could suggest an adaptation to either an
   environment with constant sedimentation rates, or to an irregular
   substrate. However, these growth forms also may indicate an absence of
   important environmental/sedimentological changes during the lifespan of
   the sponges. In addition, the growth form of this species suggests a
   calm, non-turbulent, reef-like microenvironment. Along with the other
   faunal assemblages, such as the rudists, corals, and the gastropod
   Nerinea, A. huauclillensis indicates a tropical to subtropical shallow
   marine carbonate platform setting. This new finding extends its
   stratigraphic range from the upper Hauterivian to the Aptian-Cenomanian
   interval in the eastern Tethyan realm.},

Abstract = {Hernandulcin (HE) is a non-caloric sweetener synthesized by the Mexican
   medicinal plant Phyla scaberrima. Herein we present the results of HE
   production through cell suspensions of P. scaberrima as well as the
   influence of pH, temperature, biosynthetic precursors and potential
   elicitors to enhance HE accumulation. The incorporation of
   mevalonolactone (30-400 mg L-1) farnesol (30-400 mg L-1), AgNO3
   (0.025-0.175 M), cellulase (5-60 mg L-1; 0.3 units/mg), chitin (20-140
   mg L-1) and (+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol (300-210 mg L-1) to the cell
   suspensions, resulted in a differential accumulation of HE and biomass.
   Among elicitors assayed, chitin, cellulase and farnesol increased HE
   production from 93.2 to similar to 160 mg L-1 but,
   (+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol (obtained by a synthetic biology approach)
   increased HE accumulation up to 182.7 mg L-1. HE produced by the cell
   suspensions was evaluated against nine strains from six species of
   gastrointestinal bacteria revealing moderate antibacterial activity
   (MIC, 214-465 mu g mL(-1)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia
   coli and Helicobacter pylori. Similarly, HE showed weak toxicity against
   Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium bifidum (>1 mg mL(-1)), suggesting
   a selective antimicrobial activity on some species of gut microbiota.
   According to our results, chitin and (+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol were the
   most effective molecules to enhance HE accumulation in cell suspensions
   of P. scaberrima.},

Title = {Beyond words: From jaguar population trends to conservation and public
   policy in Mexico},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The jaguar (Panthera onca) is one of the most threatened carnivores in
   the Americas. Despite a long history of research on this charismatic
   species, to date there have been few systematic efforts to assess its
   population size and status in most countries across its distribution
   range. We present here the results of the two National Jaguar Surveys
   for Mexico, the first national censuses in any country within the
   species distribution. We estimated jaguar densities from field data
   collected at 13 localities in 2008-2010 (2010 hereafter) and 11
   localities in 2016-2018 (2018 hereafter). We used the 2010 census
   results as the basis to develop a National Jaguar Conservation Strategy
   that identified critical issues for jaguar conservation in Mexico. We
   worked with the Mexican government to implement the conservation
   strategy and then evaluated its effectivity. To compare the 2010 and
   2018 results, we estimated the amount of jaguar-suitable habitat in the
   entire country based on an ecological niche model for both periods.
   Suitable jaguar habitat covered similar to 267,063 km(2) (13.9\% of the
   country's territory) in 2010 and similar to 288,890 km(2) (similar to
   14.8\% of the country's territory) in 2018. Using the most conservative
   density values for each priority region, we estimated jaguar densities
   for both the high and low suitable habitats. The total jaguar population
   was estimated in similar to 4,000 individuals for 2010 census and
   similar to 4,800 for the 2018 census. The Yucatan Peninsula was the
   region with the largest population, around 2000 jaguars, in both
   censuses. Our promising results indicate that the actions we proposed in
   the National Jaguar Conservation Strategy, some of which have been
   implemented working together with the Federal Government, other NGO's,
   and land owners, are improving jaguar conservation in Mexico. The
   continuation of surveys and monitoring programs of the jaguar
   populations in Mexico will provide accurate information to design and
   implement effective, science-based conservation measures to try to
   ensure that robust jaguar populations remain a permanent fixture of
   Mexico's natural heritage.},

Title = {The Taming of Psidium guajava: Natural and Cultural History of a
   Neotropical Fruit},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Guava (Psidium guajava L., Myrtaceae) is a Neotropical fruit that is
   widely consumed around the world. However, its evolutionary history and
   domestication process are unknown. Here we examine available ecological,
   taxonomic, genetic, archeological, and historical evidence about guava.
   Guava needs full sunlight, warm temperatures, and well-distributed
   rainfall throughout the year to grow, but tolerates drought. Zoochory
   and anthropochory are the main forms of dispersal. Guava's phylogenetic
   relationships with other species of the genus Psidium are unclear. A
   group of six species that share several morphological characteristics
   are tentatively accepted as the Psidium guajava complex. DNA analyses
   are limited to the characterization of crop genetic diversity within
   localities and do not account for possible evolutionary and
   domestication scenarios. A significant amount of archeological
   information exists, with a greater number and older records in South
   America than in Mesoamerica, where there are also numerous historical
   records. From this information, we propose that: (1) the guava ancestor
   may have originated during the Middle or Late Miocene, and the savannas
   and semi-deciduous forests of South America formed during the Late
   Pleistocene would have been the most appropriate ecosystems for its
   growth, (2) the megafauna were important dispersers for guava, (3)
   dispersal by humans during the Holocene expanded guava's geographic
   range, including to the southwestern Amazonian lowlands, (4) where its
   domestication may have started, and (5) with the European conquest of
   the Neotropics, accompanied by their domestic animals, new contact
   routes between previously remote guava populations were established.
   These proposals could direct future research on the evolutionary and
   domestication process of guava.</p>},

Title = {Information out of the blue: phenotypic correlates of abdominal color
   patches in Sceloporus lizards},
Journal = {ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Colorful ornaments are important visual signals for animal communication
   that can provide critical information about the quality of the signaler.
   In this study, we focused on different color characteristics of the
   abdominal patches of males of six lizard species from the genus
   Sceloporus. We addressed three main objectives. First, we examined if
   size, brightness, saturation, and conspicuousness of these ornaments are
   indicative of body size, condition, immune function, or levels of
   testosterone and corticosterone. Second, we evaluated if the distinct
   components of these abdominal patches (blue or green patches and black
   stripes) transmit similar information about the signaler, which would
   support the redundant signal hypothesis, or if these components are
   related to different phenotypic traits, which would support the multiple
   message hypothesis. Third, we compared the phenotypic correlates of
   these ornaments among our six species to understand the degree of
   conservatism in the signaling patterns or to find species-specific
   signals. Using data collected from males in natural conditions and a
   multi-model inference framework, we found that in most species the area
   of the patches and the brightness of the blue component are positively
   related to body size. Thus, these color characteristics are presumably
   indicative of the physical strength and competitive ability of males and
   these shared signals were likely inherited from a common ancestor. In
   half of the species, males in good body condition also exhibit
   relatively larger blue and black areas, suggesting that the expression
   of these ornaments is condition-dependent. Abdominal patches also
   provide information about immunocompetence of the males as indicated by
   different correlations between certain color characteristics and
   ectoparasite load, counts of heterophils, and the heterophil:lymphocyte
   ratio. Our findings reveal that area and brightness of the abdominal
   patches signal the size and body condition of males, whereas blue
   saturation and conspicuousness with respect to the surrounding substrate
   are indicative of immune condition, thus supporting the multiple message
   hypothesis. However, some of these correlations were not shared by all
   species and, hence, point to intriguing species-specific signals.},

Abstract = {Since its conception, the simultaneous measurement approach of Arthurs
   and Kelly has been a significant tool for the better understanding of
   the measurement process in quantum mechanics. This model considers a
   strong interaction Hamiltonian by discarding the free evolution part. In
   this work, we study the effect of the full dynamics-taking into account
   the free Hamiltonian-on the optimal limits of retrodictive and
   predictive accuracy of the simultaneous measurement process of position
   and momentum observables. To do that, we consider a minimum uncertainty
   Gaussian state as the system under inspection, which allows to carry out
   an optimal simultaneous measurement. We show that the inclusion of the
   free Hamiltonian induces a spreading on the probability density of the
   measurement setting, which increases the value of the product of the
   variances of the so-called retrodictive and predictive error operators,
   this is equivalent to a reduction in the accuracy of the measurement.},

Abstract = {Wood smoke (WS) contains many harmful compounds, including polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). WS induces inflammation in the airways and
   lungs and can lead to the development of various acute and chronic
   respiratory diseases. Pulmonary fibroblasts are the main cells involved
   in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during the
   WS-induced inflammatory response. Although fibroblasts remain in a low
   proliferation state under physiological conditions, they actively
   participate in ECM remodeling during the inflammatory response in
   pathophysiological states. Consequently, we used normal human lung
   fibroblasts (NHLFs) to assess the potential effects of the
   PAHs-containing wood smoke extract (WSE) on the growth rate, total
   collagen synthesis, and the expression levels of collagen I and III,
   matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2, and the transforming growth factor
   (TGF)-beta 1. We also assessed MMPs activity. The results showed that
   WSE induced a trimodal behavior in the growth rate curves in NHLFs; the
   growth rate increased with 0.5-1 \% WSE and decreased with 2.5\% WSE,
   without causing cell damage; 5-20\% WSE inhibited the growth and induced
   cell damage. After 3 hours of exposure, 2.5\% WSE induced an increase in
   total collagen synthesis and upregulation of TGF-beta 1, collagen I and
   III, MMP-1, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 expression. However, MMP-2 expression was
   downregulated and MMP-9 was not expressed. The gelatinase activity of
   MMP-2 was also increased. These results suggest that WSE affects the ECM
   remodeling in NHLFs and indicate the potential involvement of PAHs in
   this process.},

Title = {Spatial Information in the Emergence of Life},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Information in living systems is part of a complex relationship between
   the internal organization and functionality of life. In a cell, both
   genetic-coding sequences and molecular-shape recognition are sources of
   biological information. For folded polymers, its spatial arrangement
   contains general references about conditions that shaped them, as
   imprints, defining the data for spatial (conformational) information.
   Considering the origin of life problem, prebiotic dynamics of matching
   and transfer of molecular shapes may emerge as a flow of information in
   prebiotic assemblages. The property of carrying information in molecular
   conformations is only displayed at this system organization level.
   Accordingly, spatial information is a resource for active system
   responses toward milieu disturbances. Propagation of resilient
   conformations could be the substrate for structural maintenance through
   dynamical molecular scaffolding. The above is a basis for adaptive
   behavior in potentially biogenic systems. Starting from non-structured
   populations of carrying-information polymers, in the present
   contribution, we advance toward an entire theoretical framework
   considering the active role of these polymers to support the emergence
   of adaptive response in systems that manage conformational information
   flow. We discuss this scenario as a previous step for the arising of
   sequential information carried out by genetic polymers.},

Abstract = {Mesoamerica is a cultural and geographic region with a northern boundary
   adjacent to the American Greater Southwest and a southeastern boundary
   that includes the Maya area, which is adjacent to the Caribbean. These
   regions are of interest to analyze genetic structure, ancestry, and gene
   flow between the ancient populations. We identified the mitochondrial
   DNA haplogroups and haplotypes in 19 colonial and 10 pre- Columbian Maya
   from Xcaret and 6 Paquime individuals. We analyzed our data together
   with 603 ancient individuals and with 95 colonial and 502 pre- Columbian
   individuals. The results show clear genetic differences among
   Mesoamerica, American Greater Southwest, and Caribbean regions. High
   frequency of haplogroup A in Paquime and Mine Canyon and the
   distribution of its haplotypes in the networks suggest these populations
   are probably genetically related with both Mesoamerican and the American
   Greater Southwest populations. The genetic structure of the Maya is due
   to common ancestry, and it was maintained by geographic isolation and
   gene flow mostly between Mayan populations. The Spanish conquest did not
   change this structure in the Maya from Xcaret, Quintana Roo. Although
   populations from Central Mexico are not genetically homogeneous, they
   are clearly different from Maya. Teotihuacan and Cholula were
   contemporary cities that allied to control the region, but they show
   genetic differences that could be related to a distant common ancestry;
   they probably descended from the same group but separated very early,
   before their arrival in Central Mexico.},

Abstract = {Background. Understanding the toxicity mechanism of arsenic has been
   hampered by biological, chemical factors, including the dose response
   ratio, the specificity and sensitivity of species used in bioassays from
   toxicological studies to understand their toxicodynamics. Goals. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the embryotoxic, teratogenic and
   genotoxic effect caused by exposure to arsenic, through the frequency
   analysis of malformations and micronuclei in peripheral blood
   erythrocytes in zebrafish. Methods. The toxicity curve of arsenic in
   zebrafish embryos was calculated from exposure to concentrations between
   0.0031 and 0.05 mg L-1 of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 72 hours to
   determine the mean lethal concentration (LC50) for the embryotoxicity
   and teratogenesis test. For the genotoxicity test, the calculation of
   the toxicity curve with adult zebrafish that were exposed to
   concentrations between 0.035 and 0.044 mg L-1 for 48 hours was
   previously performed in order to establish LC50. Results. The effect of
   sodium arsenite was shown to be statistically positive for
   embryotoxicity and teratogenesis tests at the evaluated concentrations.
   Exposure to sodium arsenite resulted in abnormal embryonic development
   at each of the test concentrations, in addition to malformations. And a
   statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated
   erythrocytes of 0.035, showing genotoxic damage of arsenic. Conclusions.
   This study showed that the induction of nuclear abnormalities in
   erythrocytes, as well as abnormalities in embryonic development, are
   extremely sensitive indicators in the study of toxicological effects,
   and suggest that the risk potential of this metalloid should be tested
   in future research.},

Abstract = {HfO2 thin films are proposed as a high-k dielectric gate, especially for
   the fabrication of ultra-large-scale integration systems. The effect of
   adding deionized water during the synthesis of HfO2 thin films on its
   structural and dielectric properties is reported. The study of
   nanostructured HfO2 thin films deposited on crystalline silicon wafers
   is made by applying the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) technique. For
   the synthesis of hafnium oxide thin films, hafnium acetylacetonate was
   dissolved in dimethylformamide as a hafnium source material. The
   substrate temperature was varied from 400 degrees C and up to 550
   degrees C in increments of 50 degrees C and adding deionized water
   during the process, favoring films with well-defined monoclinic
   structures. The thin films presented a nanostructured morphology and a
   rugosity with a minimum value of 0.45 nm. Refractive index values
   between 1.87 and 2.02 were obtained with an average thickness of similar
   to 21 nm. The carbon and O-H bonds decrease considerably, adding
   deionized water during the deposit. The electrical characterization
   revealed that the films deposited with deionized water have a high
   dielectric constant with a maximum value of 14.4, demonstrating that
   this addition during deposition allows thinner films with good
   dielectric properties.},

Title = {Ontogeny, anatomical structure and function of lobed stems in the

   Loefl.)},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BOTANY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Background and Aims Byttneria is one of the few climbing genera in
   Malvaceae. Some Byttneria are known for their lobed stems. We explore
   the development of these stems, how they have evolved within the group
   and their relevance in the evolution of the climbing growth form in
   Malvaceae.
   Methods We combine developmental anatomical work with phylogenefic
   comparative methods. We use Byttneria divaricata and B. filipes as
   models in the anatomical work, a review of herbarium vouchers, and the
   most recent phylogeny of Byttneria and allies to elucidate bow these
   stems evolved within the Glade under maximum-likelihood and Bayesian
   approaches. We use Page194 tests to analyse the correlated evolution of
   lobed stems and prickles.
   Key Results Each lobe coincides with one of the five vascular bundles.
   By augmented activity of the fascicular cambium in the lobes coupled
   with reduced activity of the interfascicular cambium in the interlobes,
   secondary growth increases the lobulation already present during primary
   growth. Within Byttneria and allies, lobed young stems appeared at least
   three times, once in Ayenia and twice in the paraphyletic Byttneria.
   Lobed adult stems were conserved in Bytmeria s.s., where lobed adult
   stems in combination with prickles were shown to have evolved as a
   climbing mechanism within the group; prickles were lost once within
   Byttneria s.s., in a shrubby subclade. Byttneria Clade 2 comprises
   climbers with twining cylindrical adult stems and no prickles, which
   constitutes a different climbing mechanism in the group.
   Conclusions We provide evidence of one of the few cambial variants known
   whose secondary body reflects the primary body vasculature and show that
   lobed adult stems and prickles in Byttneria could be used in the new
   delimitation of genera in the group. Lobed stems independently appeared
   in climbing Grewia, suggesting a convergence favouring the climbing
   growth form.},

Title = {Identifying management guidelines to control the invasive House Sparrow

Abstract = {Invasive species hinder the conservation objectives of natural protected
   areas, particularly of those found within or nearby urban settlements.
   Identifying the habitat and landscape traits that determine the
   establishment and persistence of populations is essential for
   implementing effective management plans to control invasive species. We
   employed multi-season occupancy models to identify the habitat and
   landscape traits that determined the local colonization and extinction
   probabilities of an invasive bird (House Sparrow-Passer domesticus), in
   order to provide recommendations for controlling its population within a
   natural protected area immersed in Mexico City. We selected traits that
   exhibited management potential to provide feasible recommendations for
   controlling the species. We observed that increasing values of shrub
   cover, tree cover, and distance to developed areas discouraged the
   sparrow from invading new sites of the reserve. Simultaneously, greater
   distances to developed areas promoted the extinction of the species
   across invaded sites. These effects might be related to resource
   availability, foraging preferences of the species, predatory exposure,
   and competition. Preserving tree and shrub cover as a natural barrier
   for dissuading species arrival represents a key management objective for
   its control in the reserve. Greater management efforts must be focused
   at those sites of the reserve that are closer to developed areas, given
   that the latter may function as source habitats for the House Sparrow.
   Our approach for identifying management actions that impact the
   population dynamics of an invasive species might provide crucial results
   to control this type of populations. Such a strategy could be replicated
   for other species and natural protected areas to enhance the
   conservation value of reserves and provide alternatives when dealing
   with invasive species.},

   Topographic, climatic, and shallow magmatic controls on scoria cone
   eruptions},

Abstract = {Scoria cones are abundant in most volcanic fields on Earth, such as the
   Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field, in the central-western sector of
   the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. However, there are few in-depth studies
   on their eruptive style and controlling factors, despite of their
   diversity in shape and composition which implies a wide range of
   hazards. Here, we present results of morphologic, stratigraphic,
   sedimentary, petrographic, and geochemical studies of the prominent Las
   Cabras scoria cone located west of the Zacapu lacustrine basin in the
   center of the Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field. This basaltic
   andesitic to andesitic volcano formed between 27 and 26 kyrs BP on the
   steep slopes (>10 degrees) of the lava shield of El Tule volcano. Over
   time, its dominant eruptive style changed from Strombolian to effusive.
   Initial explosive activity built a 170-m-high scoria cone and deposited
   thick tephra fallout on the surrounding sloping terrain. Structures in
   the deposits indicate that early friable fine-grained tephra underwent
   significant erosion due to syn-eruptive heavy rain coupled with the
   sloping nature of the underlying ground. This erosion generated lahars
   that very likely reached the Zacapu lake based on the pre-eruptive
   topography. As the explosivity dropped, lava was emitted from the base
   of the cone first to the S and SE, forming a thick, viscous lobe that
   filled a pre-existing E-W valley. The flow direction then deviated to
   the N and NE, to form thinner, less-viscous lobes fed from the vent by
   an open-channel. The lavas are covered by hummocks made of agglutinates
   and bombs that indicate that the eruption terminated by catastrophic
   collapse of the SE sector of the cone, possibly triggered by the
   intrusion of magma within the cone, which destabilized its downslope
   segment. The sudden flank failure was potentially associated with a late
   effusive event and the hummocks may have been carried away by the lava
   surge. Whole-rock chemical variations and crystal disequilibrium
   textures point toward a complex magma feeding system, involving mixing
   and mingling between different magma batches. This study shows that the
   formation of scoria cones on a terrain with a marked slope (>10 degrees)
   has profound impacts on the eruption dynamics and related hazards due to
   its effect on cone stability and ash erosion. It also evidences the
   erosive effect of syn-eruptive rain on fine-grained tephra, especially
   when deposited on a slope. Finally, it reveals the complex magmatic
   processes that may occur in the shallow plumbing system of monogenetic
   andesitic volcanoes, which could be particularly important in inland
   areas of continental arcs.},

   diversification and development of multiple cultures such as Tolteca,
   Teotihuacan, Mexica, and Maya, among others. Despite this rich cultural
   heritage, radiometric dating of Mexican cultural samples with
   radiocarbon (C-14) began only in the 1980s and with accelerator mass
   spectrometry (AMS) in 2013. Analysis of C-14 with AMS is the most widely
   used technique to date archaeological objects and cultural heritage.
   Since 2013, the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (LEMA) facility
   of the Institute of Physics at UNAM (IF-UNAM) has supported
   archaeological research in Mexico, but also investigation in other areas
   such as geology, physics, chemistry, and environmental sciences through
   the analysis of C-14, Be-10, Al-26, I-129, and Pu. The absolute dating
   with C-14 continues to be the core of LEMA's work, where different
   geographical scenarios of the country and climatic conditions present
   very diverse analytical challenges. This work presents a basic
   description of the AMS system of the LEMA laboratory and describes some
   applications that are currently being developed.},

Abstract = {Context Land use change, habitat loss and fragmentation are the major
   threats to jaguar conservation in Latin America. Here, we integrate the
   information of jaguar's distribution to identify priority areas for its
   conservation. Objective We evaluated the effect of topographic,
   anthropogenic and landscape variables on habitat suitability to evaluate
   potential core areas and biological corridors for jaguar conservation
   across Mexico. Methods We compiled a database of jaguar occurrence
   records, geospatial data-set of all Natural Protected Areas and using
   the expert criterion of the Mexican jaguar specialists to define Jaguar
   Geographic Regions; i.e. well-defined large units with similar
   ecological characteristics across the geographic range of jaguars in
   Mexico. We then conducted analyses of ecological niche models to
   identify Jaguar Conservation Units; i.e. core units with jaguar
   populations of 15 or more individuals. We used Least Cost Path and
   Circuit Theory analyses to define the Biological Corridors; i.e. regions
   with enough habitat to allow for jaguar dispersal along their geographic
   range, but putting emphasis in connecting Jaguar Conservation Units.
   Results We identified 5 Jaguar Geographic Regions (JGRs), 10 Jaguar
   Conservation Units (JCUs), and 13 Biological Corridors to maintain the
   connectivity of jaguar's populations across their whole geographic range
   in Mexico. Our results showed that JGRs cover 25\% of the country but
   only 21\% of those regions are currently protected in nature reserves.
   So, our study illustrates the importance of the creation of new
   protected areas or the implementation of other schemes of conservation
   to protect larger extensions of the jaguars' habitat in Mexico. It also
   indicates that despite the reduction of jaguar range in Mexico, there
   are still relatively large and well conserved areas capable of
   maintaining jaguar populations. Conclusions Our results are a
   fundamental tool to guide the conservation and management of jaguars in
   Mexico. Our findings indicate that public jaguar conservation policy to
   protect the remaining jaguar habitat in Mexico should include the
   following actions: i) Strengthen established protected areas, ii) Create
   new protected areas, iii) Implement sustainable development programs to
   stimulate land owners to protect their lands, and iv) Develop mitigation
   measures for infrastructure. Although the window of opportunity is
   closing, our results indicate that there is still time to save jaguars
   and the plethora of species that share their habitat in Mexico.},

Title = {Small sizes, big strategies: the relationship between female size,
   matrotrophy and superfetation throughout the reproductive lives of
   poeciliid fishes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {315},
Number = {4},
Pages = {261-275},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In viviparous fishes, females of species that exhibit matrotrophy
   (post-fertilization maternal provisioning to developing embryos) and
   superfetation (ability of females to bear simultaneously multiple broods
   of embryos at distinct developmental stages) increase less in mass and
   volume during pregnancy than females of species that lack these traits.
   Such a reduction in reproductive allocation may provide greater benefits
   to young and small females for two reasons. First, they could devote
   energy and resources to both growth and reproduction. Second, they could
   compensate for the space restrictions that are inherent to a small body
   size because both superfetation and matrotrophy maximize fecundity for
   any given ovarian volume. In this study, we test the hypothesis that
   both matrotrophy and superfetation will decrease over female
   reproductive lifespan (i.e. as they grow larger). We examined
   reproductive females from 77 populations of 13 species of the family
   Poeciliidae. Remarkably, we found support for the matrotrophy prediction
   in only three populations. As expected, in these populations, small
   females were more matrotrophic than larger females, which in turn
   exhibited a predominantly lecithotrophic strategy. In one population, we
   found the opposite pattern-the degree of matrotrophy actually increased
   in larger females. With respect to superfetation, none of the
   populations showed a pattern consistent with our prediction. In fact, in
   five populations the pattern was opposite to our expectation-larger
   females produced more simultaneous broods than smaller females. Our
   findings reveal that the degree of matrotrophy and superfetation can
   vary throughout the adult lifespans of poeciliid fishes, but such
   ontogenetic shifts are not common in natural populations.},

Title = {Fruit development in the seagrass Thalassia testudinum:
   Possible relationships between structure, physiology and defense},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Even though seagrasses are clonal plants, they also invest substantial
   energy in sexual reproduction. However, little is known about the
   development of the reproductive structures of seagrasses and their
   complex interactions with ambient conditions. Here, we describe the
   structural and physiological changes during development in the fruit
   pericarp of the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum, and their
   possible role in defense mechanisms. The fruit exocarp develops
   protuberances with a monostratified epidermis. The parenchyma below the
   exocarp epidermis, consists of chlorenchyma with abundant chloroplasts
   and cells that, in the early stages of development of the fruit,
   accumulate proanthocyanins and other diverse phenolic compounds, in the
   course of development, vary in quantity and solubility. During the
   intermediate and late stages of development, when the fruit emerges
   above the sediment, idioblasts with oxalate crystals are formed. Changes
   during the fruit development in morphology, phenolic compounds and
   oxalate crystal deposits, may be related to various metabolic processes
   to maintain homeostasis, such as downregulation of photosynthetic ROS.
   At the same time, these changes may also provide defense mechanisms
   against herbivores. Parrotfish appear undeterred by phenolic compounds
   in the exocarp of young manually exposed fruits; but they do not consume
   the pericarp of mature fruits (naturally emerged above the sediments)
   with oxalate crystals. These findings suggest that timing and
   integration of morphological and metabolic changes during fruit
   development guarantee both successful development and protection of the
   seeds.},

Abstract = {In this work, we conduct a comprehensive computational study of the
   optical and photothermal properties of multifunctional
   alpha-Fe2O3/Au/SiO2 nanorice matryoshka nanoparticles using a
   combination of boundary element method, finite element method, and
   discontinuous Galerkin time-domain method. The magnetic core in the
   nanorice allows their use as a contrast agent in nuclear magnetic
   resonance technique as well as dragging and rotating the nanoparticles
   with an external magnetic field, while the plasmonic counterpart enables
   the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances. We show that
   both longitudinal and transverse plasmonic resonances induced within the
   hybrid asymmetric nanoparticle can be sintonized into the 650-900 nm
   range of the electromagnetic spectrum, where the absorption of tissue is
   minimal. Thus, it is possible to heat the nanoparticle's local
   surrounding environment, making the proposed nanorice particles good
   candidates for thermal ablation treatment of cancer cells. We show that
   the local temperature in the nanorice surroundings can be increased by
   up to 80 K while illuminating the hybrid system at the resonant
   frequency of the longitudinal plasmon mode with typical and reasonable
   optical power density of 5 W/cm(2).},

Title = {An historical account of the two-fluid theory for superfluidity},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In 1924, Einstein showed the theoretical possibility of the
   three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, for mass particles. When
   published, his work did not attract the scientific community, until
   approximately ten years later, when Fritz London retook it along with
   Laszlo Tisza, to generate a theory able to explain the superfluidity in
   terms of two fluids: one formed by atoms within the condensate state,
   and the second formed with atoms in the normal state. Later, under the
   commitment of Kapitsa, Landau began the research about the superfluidity
   problem, with conceptually different assumptions than those of London
   and Tisza. Landau thought that atoms are the medium in which excitations
   are propagated, through a two-fluid model. The development of such
   theories took place in the 1930s and 1940s, when Europe was convulsed by
   political and social problems. In this work, we clarify the differences
   between both models, usually confused, and we analyse the influence of
   the historical reality in which the main scientific actors that gave
   birth to such theories were involved, elucidating why the path initiated
   by Einstein, ended in two different intents to describe the
   superfluidity phenomenon: two two-fluid theories.

Title = {Analysis of the density and distribution of entropy in biomedical
   infrared imaging for Diabetes Mellitus Type II},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS \& ENGINEERING EXPRESS},

Abstract = {We report a methodology to analyze data extracted from infrared images.
   These pictures show the lower limbs of a cohort of individuals belonging
   to, (1) voluntary controls and (2) patients diagnosed with diabetes
   mellitus type II. The analysis is presented in terms of Cross Entropy
   and temperature distributions; both using the associated thermal
   histograms. The temperature analysis is placed in terms of comparing the
   extreme values of dS/dQ, for controls and patients. In this analysis for
   the frontal view, the values of specificity and sensitivity calculated
   were 77.77\% and 91.66\%, respectively. For the back view, the
   specificity and sensitivity obtained were 88.8\% and 83.3\%,
   respectively. Instead of that, the cross-entropy analysis is placed in
   the modality of self-referencing. In this part of the study we obtained
   the coefficient of asymmetry and thermal response (ATR). The values of
   specificity and sensitivity for the ATR quotient in both cases were
   83.3\%. The results of both studies have a significant correlation with
   glucose (p < 0.01) and HbA1c (p < 0.01). It means that both approaches
   have statistical correspondence. By means of the Mann-Whitney U test,
   for independent samples, we get that the characteristic parameters we
   analyze can be differentiated among the populations of interest with a
   significance of p < 0.05. This suggests that both studies show
   consistency with the clinical diagnosis; exhibiting clear differences
   between control and patient groups.},

Abstract = {The population ecology of luciferids has been scarcely studied. This
   study examined the distribution and population parameters of Belzebub
   faxoni and Lucifer typus in the western Gulf of Mexico. Samples were
   collected using a Bongo net at 82 sampling stations during three periods
   (July, January, and October-November). Abundance data of species were
   subjected to a regression tree analysis to determine the main factors
   affecting their distribution. In addition, total length data of
   individuals were fitted to a logistic equation to estimate the size at
   first maturity. Food availability was the key factor affecting the
   distribution of B. faxoni, which exhibited its highest abundance over
   the inner shelf. In contrast, L. typus avoided low salinity waters
   (<35.9 psu), and its highest densities were found over the slope and
   oceanic areas. The sex ratio in B. faxoni was always biased towards
   females, but L. typus showed variable sex proportions. Several
   hypotheses attempting to explain these disparities are discussed. Size
   structure in B. faxoni favored small individuals in summer, the
   reproduction peak. In contrast, the L. typus population was always
   dominated by large individuals, probably transported by currents from
   the main hatching sites. Size at first maturity was higher in L. typus
   (females: 8.16 mm; males: 8.63 mm) than in B. faxoni (females: 6.53 mm;
   males: 6.74 mm). Information here provided may help to better understand
   the population dynamics of these species.},

Title = {Effects of Phylogenetic Relatedness on Fluctuation-Dependent and
   Fluctuation-Independent Coexistence Mechanisms in Multispecies
   Communities},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {198},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Evolutionary relatedness may hinder stable coexistence due to similar
   niches and nonlinear responses to competition. The mechanisms driving
   stability may respond differently to phylogenetic distance. Related
   species may be synchronic (have similar demographic responses over
   time), affecting fluctuation-dependent mechanisms: the storage effect
   should destabilize coexistence, and relative nonlinearity should be
   stronger due to increased fluctuations in competition. We tested these
   hypotheses using invasion analysis based on a model parameterized for 19
   plant species from a semiarid grassland. Although weakly, coexistence
   stability increased with phylogenetic distance. Stabilization through
   fluctuation-independent niche differentiation was stronger between
   distant relatives as a result of weaker competition. Synchronicity was
   higher between close relatives, having the expected negative effects on
   the storage effect's contribution to coexistence. Relative nonlinearity
   was strong at both ends of the phylogenetic relatedness gradient but not
   in the middle. This may be the result of different nonlinear responses
   between distant relatives and of stronger fluctuations in competition
   due to synchronicity between closer relatives. The effect of
   phylogenetic distance on coexistence was almost negligible when pairwise
   species were analyzed, in accordance with previous research.
   Phylogenetic distance became more important as more species interacted,
   however, suggesting that evolutionary relatedness may be influential in
   species-rich communities.},

Abstract = {It is well known that a small number of graphene nanoparticles embedded
   in polymers enhance the electrical conductivity; the polymer changes
   from being an insulator to a conductor. The graphene nanoparticles
   induce several quantum effects, non-covalent interactions, so the
   percolation threshold is accelerated. We studied five of the most widely
   used polymers embedded with graphene nanoparticles: polystyrene,
   polyethylene-terephthalate, polyether-ketone, polypropylene, and
   polyurethane. The polymers with aromatic rings are affected mainly by
   the graphene nanoparticles due to the pi-pi stacking, and the long-range
   terms of the dispersion corrections are predominant. The polymers with
   linear structure have a CH-pi stacking, and the short-range terms of the
   dispersion corrections are the important ones. We used the action radius
   as a measuring tool to quantify the non-covalent interactions. This
   action radius was the main parameter used in the Monte-Carlo simulation
   to obtain the conductivity at room temperature (300 K). The action
   radius was the key tool to describe how the percolation transition works
   from the fundamental quantum levels and connect the microscopic study
   with macroscopic properties. In the Monte-Carlo simulation, it was
   observed that the non-covalent interactions affect the electronic
   transmission, inducing a higher mean-free path that promotes the
   efficiency in the transmission.},

Title = {Effect of hybridization on the morphological differentiation of the red
   oaks Quercus acutifolia and Quercus grahamii (Fagaceae)},

Abstract = {In this study, the effect of hybridization on the interspecific
   differentiation of two species of red oaks, Quercus acutifolia and Q.
   grahamii, was evaluated. It is thought that hybridization is possible
   between these two species since they can inhabit adjacently and have
   periods of synchronous flowering. In addition, individuals with
   intermediate morphological attributes have been detected within their
   populations. To resolve this question, samples were collected from 280
   adult individuals from 28 sampling locations: 17 of Q. acutifolia and 11
   of Q. grahamii. To identify the individuals belonging to the parental
   species and those with the presence of hybridization, the individuals
   were genotyped with 10 nuclear microsatellite loci. To determine the
   patterns of leaf variation, two sets of morphological traits were
   considered: the first was 22 foliar morphological measurements, and the
   second was a geometric morphometry analysis using 40 two-dimensional
   pseudolandmarks. The results of the analysis of genetic allocation
   revealed that a large proportion of individuals from all populations
   showed evidence of introgression in their genomes. The morphological
   comparison showed that there was a clear differentiation between
   individuals classified as purebred members of the species Q. acutifolia
   and Q. grahamii. Individuals with evidence of primary hybridization (F1)
   were scarce and had morphologies similar to those of the Q. grahamii
   species. On the other hand, introgressed individuals (F2) seemed to be
   very similar to their genetically closest parents. The results show that
   the patterns of foliar morphological variation are not very useful for
   detecting hybridization events between species with continuous genetic
   exchange.},

Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the task of the selectively capture of fullerene molecules
   from soot is the subject of several studies. The low solubility of
   fullerenes represents a drawback when the goal is to purify them and to
   carry out chemical procedures where they participate. There are
   different molecules that can act as a kind of cocoon, giving shelter to
   the fullerene cages in such a way that they can be included in a
   solution or can be extracted from a mix. In this work, a theoretical
   study of some known and new proposed organic molecules of this kind is
   presented. In all cases, the interaction occurs with the help of a
   metallic atom or ion which plays the role of a bridge, providing a place
   for a metallocene like interaction to occur. The thermodynamic arguments
   favoring the formation of this adduct species are addressed as well as
   the nature of the bond by means QTAIM parameters and frontier molecular
   orbitals analysis.},

Abstract = {Acari represent the most diverse group within the arachnids with some
   60,000 described species. It is generally believed that most species of
   mites are waiting to be discovered and described. Zootaxa was the most
   important journal for mite taxonomy during the last twenty years (2001
   to 2020). It published 1,305 papers by 1,057 authors during these two
   decades, with descriptions of 3,271 new taxa/names, which account for
   24.4\% of the total indexed in Zoological Record. The numbers of new
   synonyms of Acari in Zootaxa (334) also accounted for nearly a quarter
   (24.9\%) of the total published during this period. These data indicate
   that Zootaxa has been an important and leading journal for acarologists
   to document the diversity of mites and ticks in the world.},

   diameter},
Journal = {APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {408},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {A digraph is k-quasi-transitive if the existence of a directed path of
   length k from vertex u to vertex v implies that u and v are adjacent;
   this family is a generalization of both tournaments and transitive
   digraphs.
   Wang and Zhang proved that, when k is even, every strong
   k-quasi-transitive digraph with diameter at least k + 2 contains a
   hamiltonian path, and asked whether under the same assumptions, a
   hamiltonian cycle could be found. In this work we answer this question
   in the affirmative, and moreover, we prove that not only hamiltonicity,
   but pancyclicity can be proved. As a byproduct of our proof, we derive a
   polynomial time algorithm to find a hamiltonian cycle in a
   k-quasi-transitive digraph with diameter at least k + 2, for even values
   of k. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Preventive measures based in the control of insect vectors are
   considered as the best choice to decrease the incidence of insect-borne
   diseases. Herein we report on the volatile content of the leaf essential
   oils from Marina neglecta, a medicinal plant distributed in the tropical
   regions of southern Mexico. In order to investigate the chemical
   variation of the essential oils, a volatile screening was performed
   during the four seasons of the years 2016-2019. Simultaneously, their
   biological activity was tested on distinct life stages of Meccus
   pallidipennis, M. bassolsae, Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. Essential
   oils were mainly constituted of beta-pinene (>30\%) beta-caryophyllene
   (>25\%) and germacrene D (>13\%). Dorsal-abdomen application of
   essential oils on triatomines, revealed an efficient LC50 for nymphs of
   the stages I to III (4 mu g/insect), nymphs of the stages IV to V (5-6
   mu g/insect), and adults (7-8 mu g/insect). The LT50 for the stages I to
   III was between 6 and 8 h, whereas that for the stages IV to V and
   adults oscillated between 12 and 16 h and 22 to 26 h, respectively.
   Fumigation experiments performed on nymph V, demonstrated that 300 mu g
   L-1 air produced 100\% mortality after 72 h post-treatment. Among tested
   volatiles, beta-pinene and beta-caryophyllene produced a comparable
   mortality rate (p < 0.01) than that of essential oils in the stages
   assayed. Essential oils showed strong larvicidal (LC50, 24-36 mu g
   mL(-1)) and adulticidal (35-48 mu g mL(-1)) activities in mosquito
   species with an LT50 of 4.5 h and 25-35 min, respectively. The
   evaluation of beta-pinene produced a significant mortality rate (p <
   0.01) in larvae whereas germacrene D was the most effective volatile (p
   < 0.01) against adults of both mosquito species. According to our
   results, beta-pinene was the most effective volatile against the four
   insect species evaluated and its effect was comparable to that of the
   essential oil.},

Abstract = {Two new species of Viannaia from the intestine of the North American
   opossums, Didelphis virginiana (Virginia opossum), and Philander opossum
   (gray four-eyed opossum), are described based on morphological and
   molecular data, through an integrative taxonomic approach. Maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses for each dataset and the
   concatenated dataset were performed using a mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, and the nuclear ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). The phylogenetic analyses
   revealed 2 new species that occur in Mexico, one from the western state
   of Colima and another from the southern state of Chiapas. Our
   phylogenetic trees for both molecular markers and concatenated datasets
   yielded similar topologies with high bootstrap values and posterior
   probabilities. Viannaia is recovered as a monophyletic group, but the
   family Viannaiidae appears as non-monophyletic, due to the position of
   Travassostrongylus scheibelorum, similar to previous studies. Finally,
   the morphology of Viannaia and Hoineffia is discussed.},

Abstract = {Black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were
   measured in Mexico City (UNAM observatory) with a Photoacoustic
   Extinctiometer-PAX (BC) and a Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy
   analyzer-CRDS (CO and CO2), from November 2014 to July 2016. The
   objective of this study was to determine temporal variations of BC, CO,
   and CO2, their mutual correlations, and evaluation of the Mexico City
   emission inventory. The highest concentrations of pollutants were
   detected in cold dry season. The average concentrations of BC, CO, and
   CO2, for the entire period, were 2.95 mu g m(-3), 0.64 ppm, and 421.81
   ppm, respectively. We calculated Delta BC/Delta CO, Delta BC/Delta CO2,
   and Delta CO/Delta CO2 using three methods to obtain a confidence
   interval for the emission ratios. BC, CO, CO2 concentrations, and the
   Delta BC/Delta CO ratio were maximum in the early morning, while the
   Delta BC/Delta CO2 and Delta CO/Delta CO2 peak was maximum in the
   afternoon. BC and CO have a weekday/weekend difference. The estimated
   slopes (Delta BC/Delta CO, Delta BC/Delta CO2, and Delta CO/Delta CO2)
   were compared with the emission ratios (BC/CO, BC/CO2, and CO/CO2)
   derived of the 2016 Mexico City emissions inventory. For mobile sources,
   the emission ratios of BC/CO and BC/CO2 were within the measurement
   range of Delta BC/Delta CO and Delta BC/Delta CO2, while CO/CO2 was
   under-estimated in the emission inventory.},

Abstract = {Assessing the impact of working landscapes on biodiversity and defining
   locally contextualized management guidelines for productive activities
   are key for sustainability. Occupancy dynamics provide information about
   sites in the landscape that are either avoided or preferred by
   populations through the estimation of extinction and colonization
   probabilities, respectively. We identified the habitat traits that
   affected colonization and extinction probabilities of target birds
   (forest-dependent, endemic, or conservation concern species) within a
   Neotropical working landscape by using multi-season occupancy models to
   point count data collected through a participatory monitoring approach
   and considering our imperfect detectability of species in the field. We
   provided colonization and extinction scenarios according to local land
   uses (forestry plots, urban-cropfield areas, and conservation forests)
   to recommend management activities that could have a positive impact on
   bird conservation. Shrub cover was key for local colonization of most of
   our focal species. Increasing values of tree size and tree species
   richness can enhance microhabitat complexity, which in turn promotes the
   presence of arboreal birds. Selective forestry management, in which only
   the largest individuals of a few tree species are extracted, promoted
   high colonization rates of birds because the structure of the vegetation
   remains relatively unaffected. In contrast, intensive forestry
   management plots, in which most trees are removed, resulted detrimental
   for bird occupancy. Local management guidelines should pay special
   attention to maintaining shrub cover, tree size, and tree species
   richness above critical values (>50\%, >30 cm, >7 tree species,
   respectively) to promote habitat use by birds in this type of working
   landscapes.

   del ge ` nero por la presencia de espacios intertabulares que miden no

   medir 0.13 mm). Estas son caracteristicas unicas dentro del ge ` nero.
   Por su parte, Blastochaetetes flabellum Michelin es f ` acilmente

   paralelas en la superficie de los ejemplares. Por otro lado,
   Acanthochaetetes huauclillensis S ` anchez-Beristain y Garcia-Barrera se
   puede distinguir de otros miembros del ge ` nero Acanthochaetetes por el
   patr ` on escalariforme formado por las tabulas en las caliculas
   adyacentes. Paleoecol ` ogicamente, los quete ` tidos mexicanos muestran
   m ` as o menos las mismas formas de crecimiento -de d ` omica a
   laminar-, las cuales podrian estar relacionadas con tasas de sedimentaci
   ` on constante en un ambiente de baja energia (arrecife o ambientes
   similares a arrecifes). Sin embargo, es posible encontrar microbialitas
   a menudo asociadas con Acanthochaetetes huauclillensis, mientras que no
   se pueden encontrar indicios de este tipo
   A review on the findings of chaetetid sponges in Mexico is made. Up to
   date, two localities house the whole diversity of Mesozoic chaetetids in
   the country consisting of three species, all of them from the
   Cretaceous. The studied localities are Arroyo La Cruz, in the state of
   Oaxaca, and El Gorrion, in the state of San Luis Potosi. At Arroyo La
   Cruz, outcrops from the San Isidro Formation (of a Hauterivian-Barremian
   age) can be found, whereas Coniacian to Santonian deposits from the
   Tamasopo Formation can be located at El Gorrion. Acanthochaetetes
   huauclillensis Sanchez-Beristain and Garcia Barrera is the only species
   that can be found in the state of Oaxaca. In contrast, two species of
   the genus Blastochaetetes, namely Blastochaetetes flabellum Michelin and
   Blastochaetetes reitneri nov. sp. Sanchez-Beristain and Garcia-Barrera,
   make up the diversity of the El Gorrion locality.
   Blastochaetetes reitneri nov sp. Sanchez-Beristain and Garcia-Barrera
   can be differentiated from other species in the genus by the presence of
   intertabular spaces measuring no less than 2 mm, and thick tabulae (as
   much as 0.13 mm). These are unique features among the genus. For its
   part, Blastochaetetes flabellum Michelin is easily recognisable by the
   pattern formed by parallel concentric bands on the surface of the
   specimens. On the other hand, Acanthochaetetes huauclillensis
   Sanchez-Beristain and Garcia-Barrera can be distinguished from other
   members of the genus Acanthochaetetes by the scalariform pattern formed
   by the tabulae at adjacent calicles. Palaeoecologically, Mexican
   chaetetid sponges more or less show the same growth forms, from domical
   to laminar, both of which could be related to constant sedimentation
   rates in a low-energy environment (reef-or reef-like settings). However,
   microbialites are often associated to Acanthochaetetes huauclillensis,
   whereas no hint to these deposits can be found related to
   Blastochaetetes.
   Mexican chaetetids also have important palaeobiogeographic and
   stratigraphic implications. Evidences of Blastochaetetes for the country
   represent the most recent record for the genus. This could mean that it
   dispersed westward from Europe, where the oldest records can be found.
   On the other hand, the finding of Acanthochaetetes in Mexico during the
   Hauterivian to Barremian implies its dispersion to the Western Tethyan
   Realm prior to its diversity peak in Europe in the Albian.
   The fact that Mesozoic deposits are widespread in Mexico implies the
   possibility of finding multiple specimens in the future, which would
   deepen the knowledge on these organisms. Moreover, since one of the
   genera studied here -Acanchochaetetes-is an extant taxon, the
   possibility of finding well-preserved post-Cretaceous chaetetid
   specimens for further studies is high.},

Abstract = {The family Myobiidae Megnin, 1878 includes permanent parasites of the
   fur of different orders of mammals. Because the information on this
   family is scarce and scattered, in this work, we compile the available
   information on Myobiidae in Mexico. In total, we recorded 41 species
   (one undetermined, one a species inquirenda) belonging to 13 genera and
   three subfamilies, associated with four orders of mammals: Chiroptera,
   Didelphimorphia, Rodentia and Soricomorpha. We also reported for the
   first time in Mexico Eudusbabekia jimenezi (Dusbabek, 1967) and E.
   saguei (Dusbabek, 1967), parasitizing bats of the family Mormoopidae in
   the States of Colima, Nayarit and San Luis Potosi, and Acanthophthirius
   lasiurus (Fain \& Whitaker, 1976 ) associated with the bat Lasiurus
   cinereus (Palisot de Beauvois) (family Vespertilionidae) in Ciudad de
   Mexico. We recorded new associations with bat hosts: E. provirilia
   Morales-Malacara, Guzman-Cornejo \& LopezOrtega, 2002 with Leptonycteris
   yerbabuenae Martinez \& Villa (Phyllostomidae); E. saguei with
   Pteronotus davyi Gray (Mormoopidae), and Ioannela leptonycteris (Fain,

   The first unit crops out northwest of the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in
   central Chiapas. It is a complex lithological unit mainly composed of
   siliciclastic rocks interbedded with limestone. Overlying it, the
   Angostura limestone is recognized. This study focuses on a taxonomic
   study of the larger benthic and planktic foraminifera from both
   formations in order to assign age and to infer the paleoenviroment.
   The Ocozocoautla Formation includes an association of benthic as well as
   significant planktic foraminifera. Based on the microfossils
   stratigraphic distribution, two biozones were defined: the
   Pseudorbitoides rutteni-Ayalaina rutteni Assemblage Zone of earliest
   Maastrichtian and the upper part of the Gansserina gansseri Interval
   Zone of early Maastrichtian.
   The Angostura Formation contains dasycladacean algae and larger
   foraminifera considered as important age markers in shallow-water
   environments. Two foraminiferal interval zones were defined,
   Praechubbina breviclaustra Interval Zone of early late Maastrichtian and
   Chubbina jamaicensisTotal Range Zone oflate to latest Maastrichian age.
   The microfacies (grainstone, wackestone-packstone, wackestone) as well
   as the foraminiferal assemblage enable the paleoenvironment to be
   reconstructed, suggesting a deposit that developed in an open-water
   marine setting with moderate to high energy, characterized by benthic
   and planktic foraminifera in the Ocozocoautla Formation, while in the
   Angostura Formation a shallow-water marine protected environment is
   inferred.
   The paleobiogeographical distribution of the assemblage from both the
   Ocozocoautla and Angostura formations mostly contains endemic benthic
   foraminifera of the Caribbean Province and other few Tethysian forms of
   the Angostura Formation.},

Abstract = {Despite recent advances in diagnosis, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of
   the ten leading causes of death worldwide. Here, we engineered
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins (ESAT6, CFP10, and MTB7.7) to
   self-assemble into core-shell nanobeads for enhanced TB diagnosis.
   Respective purified Mtb antigen-coated polyester beads were
   characterized and their functionality in TB diagnosis was tested in
   whole blood cytokine release assays. Sensitivity and specificity were
   studied in 11 pulmonary TB patients (PTB) and 26 healthy individuals
   composed of 14 Tuberculin Skin Test negative (TSTn) and 12 TST positive
   (TSTp). The production of 6 cytokines was determined (IFN gamma, IP10,
   IL2, TNF alpha, CCL3, and CCL11). To differentiate PTB from healthy
   individuals (TSTp + TSTn), the best individual cytokines were IL2 and
   CCL11 (>80\% sensitivity and specificity) and the best combination was
   IP10 + IL2 (>90\% sensitivity and specificity). We describe an
   innovative approach using full-length antigens attached to biopolyester
   nanobeads enabling sensitive and specific detection of human TB. (C)

Abstract = {The essential oil from the annual plant Lepidium virginicum L. was
   chemically characterized in three consecutive years (2018-2020). The
   essential oils were evaluated in vitro and in situ on the causal agent
   of anthracnose in tamarillo fruits (Solanum betaceum). The main volatile
   constituents were phenylacetonitrile (>60 \%), linalool (>10 \%),
   limonene (>7 \%) and alpha-terpineol (>5 \%). The essential oil (MIC,
   19-30 mu g mL(-1)), phenylacetonitrile (MIC, 45 mu g mL(-1)) and
   alpha-terpineol (MIC, 73 mu g mL(-1)) caused a significant inhibition in
   the conidial viability from a wild strain of Colletotrichum acutatum,
   which was isolated and identified as a causal agent of anthracnose. The
   inoculation of conidia from C. acutatum in non-symptomatic tamarillo
   fruits, followed by the in situ treatment with different concentrations
   of the essential oil (>30 mu g mL(-1)), phenylacetonitrile and
   alpha-terpineol, significantly (p<0.01) avoided the degradation of
   anthocyanins (delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside and
   pelargonidin 3-O-rutinoside) and carotenoids (beta-cryptoxanthin and
   beta-carotene) as well as retarded yellowing and necrosis triggered by
   anthracnose at least for 10 days. Our results suggest the potential use
   of the essential oil from L. virginicum as a natural component to
   preserve the nutraceutical content of tamarillo fruits against C.
   acutatum infection.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {We introduce a lattice gas model with a modified Hamiltonian considering
   different energy for cycles of connected atoms. The system can be
   interpreted as a chalcogenide glass with pollutants forming floppy and
   rigid structures. We consider an energetic penalization for redundant
   bonds in the network. This penalization allows us to incorporate the
   topology constraints of rigidity in the network to study the
   thermodynamics of the system. We observe, depending on the parameter
   used for the penalization, that the system exhibits a typical
   first-order phase transition, or a stepped transition between the low
   and high density while varying the chemical potential. We also observe a
   hysteresis loop in the density and energy of the system. We use the area
   of these loops to calculate the irreversible enthalpy. There are two
   regimes, one where the enthalpy decreases linearly and the other with
   almost constant enthalpy. As the enthalpy is almost constant and very
   low, we interpreted this as the intermediate phase of the chalcogenide
   glasses.},

Abstract = {Bismuth silicate glasses at various compositions of Mn2+ and Yb3+ were
   successfully synthesized by conventional melt and quenching method of
   40\% Bi2O3: 60\% SiO2. Mn2+ presents a simultaneous green-orange
   emission by means of simultaneous four and six folded coordination when
   exciting with 350 nm and by up-conversion when exciting with 980 nm Yb3+
   presents its known 976 nm emission by its F-2(5/2) -> F-2(7/2)
   transition when exciting at 350 nm in (6)A(1)(S) -> E-4(D) Mn2+ energy
   level. This is proposed to be possible by the existence of Mn2+-Yb3+
   dimers, that produce new energy levels seen in absorbance and excitation

Title = {Programmed cell death is the cause of central cell degeneration and
   single fertilization in Marathrum schiedeanum (Cham.)
   Tul (Podostemaceae)},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Podostemaceae family is exceptional among angiosperms because of the
   absence of double fertilization, a remarkable characteristic that
   appears to extend to the entire family. A recent investigation of some
   members of the family, including Dalzellia zeylanica (Tristichoideae),
   Griffithella zeylanica, Polypleurum stylosum, Zeylanidium lichenoides,
   and Zeylanidium maheshwarii (Podostemoideae), revealed that the central
   cell in all of them is degenerated when the pollen tube arrives at the
   synergid. In the present work, we studied the ontogenetic development of
   the female gametophyte. We also conducted a terminal deoxynucleotidyl
   transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and an ultrastructural
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of Marathrum schiedeanum
   (Podostemoideae) to determine the causes of central cell degeneration.
   The results show that in the early stage, the female gametophyte was
   4-celled and 4-nucleated, but the central cell degenerated very quickly
   before the start of anthesis. The reduced mature female gametophyte is
   3-nucleate, 3-celled. TUNEL staining and ultrastructural TEM analysis
   indicated that developmental programmed cell death (PCD) mediated the
   degeneration of the central cell. The central cell displayed a
   significant quantity of vacuoles containing some cellular material, and
   the compact chromatin was present in the nucleus and DNA fragmentation
   occurred. The factors that trigger PCD in the central cell are unknown,
   but the test results confirm that pollination is not necessary for it to
   occur. The death of the central cell before pollination prevents the
   possibility of double fertilization and consequently results in failure

Title = {Steroid hormones, ectoparasites, and color: Sex, species, and seasonal
   differences in Sceloporus lizards},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {304},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Testosterone, in addition to promoting the expression of sexual
   ornaments can negatively affect immune function, leaving individuals
   more susceptible to parasites (immunocompetence handicap hypothesis).
   Immunosuppressive effects of testosterone also can occur indirectly,
   through increased glucocorticoid hormones (corticosterone, cortisol).
   Therefore, the expression of sexual ornaments and the ability to respond
   to parasites and diseases may be influenced by the interaction between
   testosterone and corticosterone. In this study we examined correlations
   of both testosterone and corticosterone with ectoparasite load and with
   expression of colorful sexual ornaments (patches on belly and throat) in
   three species of Sceloporus lizards (S. grammicus, S. megalepidurus, S.
   torquatus). In addition, we evaluated contributions of sex, body
   condition, and reproductive season. We expected that individuals with
   higher testosterone and lower corticosterone levels would have more
   colorful ornaments than individuals with higher corticosterone levels.
   In addition, if testosterone has negative effects on immune function but
   only at higher corticosterone levels, individuals with higher levels of
   testosterone and corticosterone should have higher ectoparasite loads.
   Contrary to these expectations, we did not detect an interaction between
   testosterone and corticosterone statistically affecting either
   ectoparasite load or the expression of colorful ornaments. Further, we
   did not find a positive association of either testosterone or
   corticosterone on ectoparasite loads in any of the three study species.
   Only in S. grammicus males was a hormone statistically associated with
   ectoparasite load, but it was a negative association with testosterone.
   The relationships between both hormones and different aspects of the
   colorful patches (brightness and chroma) varied drastically among the
   three species as well as between sexes. Hence, even among congeneric
   species, we did not observe consistent patterns among color, steroid
   hormones and ectoparasites. Different associations between these
   variables may reflect different physiological strategies for the
   production of colorful signals and immune defense.},

Title = {Functional Pituitary Networks in Vertebrates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {The pituitary is a master endocrine gland that developed early in
   vertebrate evolution and therefore exists in all modern vertebrate
   classes. The last decade has transformed our view of this key organ.
   Traditionally, the pituitary has been viewed as a randomly organized
   collection of cells that respond to hypothalamic stimuli by secreting
   their content. However, recent studies have established that pituitary
   cells are organized in tightly wired large-scale networks that
   communicate with each other in both homo and heterotypic manners,
   allowing the gland to quickly adapt to changing physiological demands.
   These networks functionally decode and integrate the hypothalamic and
   systemic stimuli and serve to optimize the pituitary output into the
   generation of physiologically meaningful hormone pulses. The development
   of 3D imaging methods and transgenic models have allowed us to expand
   the research of functional pituitary networks into several vertebrate
   classes. Here we review the establishment of pituitary cell networks
   throughout vertebrate evolution and highlight the main perspectives and
   future directions needed to decipher the way by which pituitary networks
   serve to generate hormone pulses in vertebrates.},

Title = {What Drives Life-History Variation in the Livebearing Fish
   Poeciliopsis prolifica? An Assessment of Multiple Putative
   Selective Agents},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Life-history traits are directly linked to fitness, and therefore, can
   be highly adaptive. Livebearers have been used as models for
   understanding the evolution of life histories due to their wide
   diversity in these traits. Several different selective pressures,
   including population density, predation, and resource levels, can shape
   life-history traits. However, these selective pressures are usually
   considered independently in livebearers and we lack a clear
   understanding of how they interact in shaping life-history evolution.
   Furthermore, selective pressures such as interspecific competition are
   rarely considered as drivers of life-history evolution in poeciliids.
   Here we test the simultaneous effects of several potential selective
   pressures on life-history traits in the livebearing fish Poeciliopsis
   prolifica. We employ a multi-model inference approach. We focus on four
   known agents of selection: resource availability, stream velocity,
   population density, and interspecific competition, and their effect on
   four life-history traits: reproductive allocation, superfetation, number
   of embryos, and individual embryo size. We found that models with
   population density and interspecific competition alone were strongly
   supported in our data and, hence, indicated that these two factors are
   the most important selective agents for most life-history traits, except
   for embryo size. When population density and interspecific competition
   increase there is an increase in each of the three life-history traits
   (reproductive allocation, superfetation, and number of embryos). For
   individual embryo size, we found that all single-agent models were
   equivalent and it was unclear which selective agent best explained
   variation. We also found that models that included population density
   and interspecific competition as direct effects were better supported
   than those that included them as indirect effects through their
   influence on resource availability. Our study underscores the importance
   of interspecific competitive interactions on shaping life-history traits
   and suggests that these interactions should be considered in future
   life-history studies.},

   social goals in dense urban settings such as Mexico City. The
   feasibility of restoring unique xerophytic scrub vegetation in lava
   field remnants was evaluated in a portion of a university campus in
   Mexico City. Here we present an index (Need and Feasibility of
   Restoration Index, NFRI) for such purpose. The NFRI was designed through
   multicriteria analysis and considered ecological, economic, and social
   indicators. Cluster and principal components analysis were carried out
   to identify different groups of lava field remnants with similar
   characteristics and to point out critical variables that in turn would
   support management strategies. The outcomes made evident the necessity
   of restoring native vegetation for all of the evaluated remnants;
   however, the group containing the largest ones obtained the highest
   values for restoration feasibility and NFRI. The recovery of the rest of
   the remnants is critical to support the ecological restoration of the
   area as this may provide connectivity with better-preserved ecosystem
   remnants. When the restoration is unaffordable due to financial
   constraints, it is highly recommended to direct efforts towards
   ecological rehabilitation actions. The establishment of native
   xerophytic gardens is promoted when remnants cannot support a
   self-sustainable plant community. It is crucial to include the diversity
   of views and values of the community and the economic and ecological
   aspects to guarantee the sustainability of the landscape, especially in
   the urban context. The latter can provide better planning and design
   processes, ensuring benefits for humans and nature.},

Title = {First case of male alloparental care in amphibians: tadpole stealing in
   Darwin's frogs},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {331-335},
Abstract = {Alloparental care, i.e. care directed at non-descendant offspring, has
   rarely been described in amphibians. Rhinoderma darwinii is an
   Endangered and endemic frog of the temperate forests of Chile and
   Argentina. This species has evolved a unique reproductive strategy
   whereby males brood their tadpoles within their vocal sacs (known as
   neomelia). Since 2009, the National Zoo of Chile has developed an ex
   situ conservation programme for R. darwinii, in which during
   reproduction, adults are kept in terraria in groups of 2 females with 2
   males. In September 2018, one pair engaged in amplexus, with one of the
   males fertilizing the eggs. Twenty days later, the second male (the
   alloparent) ingested all of the 8 viable, recently hatched tadpoles,
   releasing 2 froglets 9 wk later. This unusual behaviour observed in
   captivity is complemented by observations in the field of male R.
   darwinii brooding tadpoles of markedly different sizes, possibly
   reflecting the brooding of tadpoles from different ovipositions. To our
   knowledge, this is the first documented case of male alloparental care
   in amphibians and an example of captive breeding programmes contributing
   important knowledge about the natural history of threatened species.},

Abstract = {The minimum number of total independent partition sets of V boolean OR E
   of a graph G = (V, E) is called the total chromatic number of G, denoted
   by chi `' (G). If the difference between cardinalities of any two total
   independent sets is at most one, then the minimum number of total
   independent partition sets of V boolean OR E is called the equitable
   total chromatic number, and is denoted by chi `' = (G).
   In this paper we consider equitable total coloring of coronas of cubic
   graphs, G circle H. It turns out that independently on the values of
   equitable total chromatic number of factors G and H, equitable total
   chromatic number of corona G circle H is equal to Delta(G circle H) + 1.
   Thereby, we confirm Total Coloring Conjecture (TCC), posed by Behzad in
   1964, and Equitable Total Coloring Conjecture (ETCC), posed by Wang in
   2002, for coronas of cubic graphs. As a direct consequence we get that
   all coronas of cubic graphs are of Type 1.},

Abstract = {The fishing bat Noctilio leporinus Linnaeus, 1758, represents a complex
   of subspecies with a discontinuous lowland distribution in Central,
   South America and the Caribbean. Although Mexican populations are
   currently included in the subspecies N. l. mastivus, the morphological
   variation in these groups has been poorly studied and only the body size
   differences with other subspecies have been documented. In addition, sex
   differences in cranial morphology for this complex of subspecies have
   been identified previously. To determine whether there are geographic
   differences between 2 isolated Mexican populations of N. l. mastivus and
   quantify the cranial sexual dimorphism in this subspecies, we performed
   geometric morphometric analyses of 2 dimensional landmark configurations
   describing cranial shapes. Our results support significant shape
   differences between the Pacific coast (west) and Gulf of MexicoYucatan
   Peninsula (east) populations, but no differences in cranial size were
   found. There were differences between sexes in the size and shape of the
   sagittal crest, in both populations, and these results suggest a
   continuous trend of development of this character in males, which imply
   functional differences in masticatory function between sexes.
   Morphological differences between populations could be related to
   genetic isolation and may be accentuated by differences in habitat
   structure between the dry (west) and humid (east) slopes of the Mexican
   mountains.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Obesity has been linked with an increased incidence of
   melanoma; however, there are few data about its impact on melanoma
   prognosis. We aimed to determine if there is an association between body
   mass index (BMI) and overall survival (OS) in 707 patients with
   melanoma.
   Material and methods: A retrospective study of 707 patients with
   melanoma collected consecutively from 2005 to 2015 with a diagnosis of
   melanoma, who were been diagnosed and treated in our institution and who
   had clinical follow-up was carried out. Survival analysis was performed
   comparing patients according to their BMI.
   Results: In a multivariate analysis, factors influencing the 5-year OS
   were a positive margin (HR = 3.475, 95\% CI: 1.829-6.600), the
   clinical-stage (HR = 2.565, 95\% CI: 2.020-3.257, per switch to the
   upper stage), ulceration (HR = 3.475, 95\% CI: 1.829-6.600), and BMI
   (HR.905, p = 0.018 for the overweight group; HR = 0.663, p = 0.021 for
   obesity grade I).
   Conclusions: Patients who had a BMI between 25 and 34.9 kg/m(2) had
   better survival.},

Abstract = {Obesity is a global health threat and a risk factor for several
   metabolic conditions. Though circadian dysfunction has been considered
   among the multiple causes of obesity, little work has been done to
   explore the relationship between obesity, circadian dysfunction, and
   sexual dimorphism. The Neotomodon alstoni mouse is a suitable model for
   such research. This study employed N. alstoni mice in a chronobiological
   analysis to determine whether there is circadian desynchronization of
   relative PER1 and BMAL1 protein levels in the hypothalamus, liver,
   visceral white adipose tissue, kidney, and heart. It also compared
   differences between sexes and lean and obese N. alstoni adult mice, by
   recording behavior and daily circulating serum melatonin as markers of
   circadian output. We found that obese mice display reduced locomotor
   activity. Additionally, Cosinor analyses of the relative expression of
   PER1 and BMAL1 show differences between lean and obese mice in a
   sex-linked manner. The PER1 24 h rhythm was absent in all tissues of
   obese males and significant in the tissues of obese females. The BMAL1
   24 h rhythm also was significant in most of the tissues tested in lean
   males, whereas it was significant and shifted the acrophase (peak time
   of rhythm) in most of the tissues in obese females. Both lean male and
   female mice showed a rhythmic 24 h pattern of circulating serum
   melatonin. This daily profile was not only absent in obese mice of both
   sexes but showed sexual dimorphism. Obese male mice showed lower
   circulating levels of melatonin compared to lean male mice, but they
   were higher in obese females compared to lean females. Our results
   suggest that obesity in N. alstoni is associated with an internal
   circadian desynchronization in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, this
   study reinforces the need for further research on the neuroendocrinology
   of obesity and circadian rhythms using this biological model.},

Title = {A least microenvironmental uncertainty principle (LEUP) as a generative
   model of collective cell migration mechanisms},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Collective migration is commonly observed in groups of migrating cells,
   in the form of swarms or aggregates. Mechanistic models have proven very
   useful in understanding collective cell migration. Such models, either
   explicitly consider the forces involved in the interaction and movement
   of individuals or phenomenologically define rules which mimic the
   observed behavior of cells. However, mechanisms leading to collective
   migration are varied and specific to the type of cells involved.
   Additionally, the precise and complete dynamics of many important
   chemomechanical factors influencing cell movement, from signalling
   pathways to substrate sensing, are typically either too complex or
   largely unknown. The question is how to make quantitative/qualitative
   predictions of collective behavior without exact mechanistic knowledge.
   Here we propose the least microenvironmental uncertainty principle
   (LEUP) that may serve as a generative model of collective migration
   without precise incorporation of full mechanistic details. Using
   statistical physics tools, we show that the famous Vicsek model is a
   special case of LEUP. Finally, to test the biological applicability of
   our theory, we apply LEUP to construct a model of the collective
   behavior of spherical Serratia marcescens bacteria, where the underlying
   migration mechanisms remain elusive.},

Abstract = {In this work we determine the C-14 content in a graphite bar used in the
   core of the research nuclear reactor TRIGA MARK III, at the ``Instituto

   C-14/C-12 ratio was measured, using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)
   at the Laboratorio Nacional de Espectrometria de Masas con Aceleradores
   (LEMA) at the ``Instituto de Fisica de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma
   de Mexico{''} (IFUNAM). Our results show a C-14 ratio over three orders
   of magnitude higher than that found in modern organic matter. A
   gamma-ray spectroscopy study of the graphite bar with a High Purity
   Germanium detector (HPGe) shows the presence of the same radioactive
   isotopes reported in previous studies of similar bars.},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The structural and photoluminescent results of the lanthanum, erbium,
   ytterbium and lithium doped hafnium oxide phosphors; are presented.
   These powders were synthesized by the solvent evaporation technique,
   different percentages of doping of the lanthanides were carried out,
   obtaining monoclinic and cubic phases, also a cubic phase is present
   when doping lanthanides with 28\% mol. Up-conversion (UC) and
   down-conversion (DC) luminescence spectra when excited with a 980 nm
   laser, three emission regions are presented; two in the visible
   (up-conversion) and one in the infrared (downshift), are observed. The
   green emission located at 528 nm, 543 nm and 559 nm; associated whit
   transitions of erbium ion (H-2(11/2) + S-4(3/2)) -> I-4(15/2) and in the
   red emission located at 653 nm and 678 nm; associated whit transitions
   of erbium ion (F-4(9/2) + I-4(9/2)) -> I-4(15/2). In 1532 nm, the
   infrared down conversion associated electronic transition I-4(13/2) ->
   I-4(15/2) of erbium ion. The luminescence emission intensity increase in
   green is 336 times and in red is 105 times when doping with lithium in
   comparison with samples without lithium co-doped.
   In the XRD diffractograms shown the monoclinic, cubic and mix of the
   phases in the phosphors; these are confirmed with the TEM diffraction
   patterns. The EDS result indicates the presence of HfO2, Er3+ and Yb3+,
   in the phosphorus; hafnium decreases due to the presence of ions
   lanthanides. XPS showed changes in energy values due to doping of
   lanthanides. The CIE diagram indicates that HfO2 doped phosphors have a
   variety of shades from red to yellow. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Using a Fractal Model},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the study of water transference in soil according to Darcy law, the
   knowledge of hydrodynamic characteristics, formed by the water retention
   curve theta(psi), and the hydraulic conductivity curve K(psi) are of
   great importance. The first one relates the water volumetric content
   (theta) with the water-soil pressure (psi); the second one, the
   hydraulic conductivity (K) with the water-soil pressure. The objective
   of this work is to establish relationships between both curves using
   concepts of probability theory and fractal geometry in order to reduce
   the number of unknown functions. The introduction of four definitions
   used at the literature of the pore effective radius that is involve in
   the general model has permitted to establish four new specials models to
   predict the relative hydraulic conductivity. Some additional
   considerations related to the definitions of flow effective area and the
   tortuosity factor have allow us to deduce four classical models that are
   extensively used in different studies. In particular, we have given some
   interpretations of its empirical parameters in the fractal geometry
   context. The resulting functions for hydrodynamic characteristics can be
   utilized in many studies of water movement in the soil.},

   assume that wastewater had contaminated supply sources. Fecal indicator
   bacteria (FIB) counts were enumerated in household water of two
   wastewater-irrigated areas, Tula and Tlahuelilpan, and a groundwater
   irrigated area, Tecozautla. During 2016-2017, household water,
   wastewater, and groundwater were sampled, analyzing fecal coliforms,
   fecal enterococci, and Escherichia coli, following membrane filtration
   procedures, and confirming the presence of E. coli by polymerase chain
   reaction. Nearly 50\% of household water contained fecal contamination
   of up to 4.62 x 10(4) CFU/100 mL. Significant differences between FIB
   counts in household water from Tula and Tecozautla were observed by
   Kruskal-Wallis and Dunnett tests. Household water samples from Tula
   contained highest FIB counts. Wastewater from Tula and Tlahuelilpan
   contained counts of six orders-of-magnitude of FIB. Counts were high
   when residual chlorine was <0.2 mg L-1 and underwater storage. This
   research serves as a baseline to observe improvement with a newly
   installed wastewater treatment plant. Safe irrigation wastewater reuse
   should be performed under strict surveillance, considering human safety
   a priority.},

Abstract = {In the Basin of Mexico, one of the most important economic regions in
   the country with over 22 million inhabitants, peri-urban streams have
   been transformed into sewers, drains, and pipes to avoid flooding or
   unsanitary conditions; the change affects not only the ecosystem's goods
   and services but also the aquatic communities that support the natural
   ecological processes. We aimed to develop a diatom-based diagnosis of
   the ecological quality of these aquatic ecosystems through the study of
   epilithic diatom response to regional environmental gradients. Samples
   of epilithic diatoms and water were collected in 45 sites representing
   12 perennial streams, and multivariate analyses were performed on
   environmental and biological data. The ecological quality gradient to
   which diatoms responded was related to oxygen saturation, soluble
   reactive phosphorous, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and
   hydromorphological quality. Three species groups were recognized
   according to their ecological preferences along CCA1 axis, indicators of
   high and low ecological quality, and tolerant species. By assigning an
   indicator value to each species group, we calculated the DEQI using the
   formula adapted from Pantle and Buck, indicating five different
   ecological quality classes. This index is proposed for complementing the
   ecological quality evaluation as a biological metric that responds to
   multiple regional stressors of the structure and function of these
   peri-urban streams in the Basin of Mexico.},

Title = {Phylogeny, Diversification Rate, and Divergence Time of Agave sensu
   lato (Asparagaceae), a Group of Recent Origin in the Process of
   Diversification},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Agave sensu lato is one of the most diverse and complex genera of
   Asparagaceae, with more than 250 species. The morphological, ecological,
   and evolutionary diversity of the group has complicated its taxonomical
   study. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data to
   reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the Agave genus. We
   included 107 species of the Asparagaceae family from which 83 correspond
   to the Agave sensu lato clade (Agave sensu stricto + Polianthes +
   Manfreda and Prochnyanthes, which together represent 30\% of the genus)
   and as outgroups the genera Dasylirion, Hesperoyucca, Chlorogalum,
   Camassia, Hesperaloe, Yucca, Beschorneria, and Furcraea, in order to
   estimate the age and propose the history of their diversification.
   Previous studies postulated the relevance of the Miocene in the
   speciation rates of the agaves, as well as the relevance of the type of
   inflorescence in its diversification. However, these assertions have not
   been well supported. The analysis of chloroplast regions resulted in low
   resolution, which could be the consequence of the few variable sites. On
   the other hand, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) implemented in our
   analysis ensued in higher resolution and better support values. Our
   phylogenetic analyses recovered five groups; one is the Striatae group,
   which is the sister group to Agave sensu stricto clade. Within this
   clade, we found three main groups with high support; these groups are
   not related with previous morphological proposals. We also analyzed the
   dates of origin and diversification rates. A Bayesian analysis of
   macroevolutionary mixtures indicated two significant shifts; the first
   was identified at 6.18 Ma, where the speciation rate increased to 4.10
   species/Mya, this shift occurred during the late Miocene period,
   characterized by the emergence of arid biomes in North America. The
   second was identified at a stem age of 2.68 Ma where the speciation rate
   increased to 6.04 species/Mya. Concerning the ancestral reconstruction
   state of the inflorescence type in the Agave sensu stricto clade, the
   spike inflorescence character was predominant in the early-diverging
   groups, whereas the late-diverging groups present panicle inflorescences
   as the predominant character and higher speciation rates.},

Title = {Moss (Hypnum amabile) as biomonitor of genotoxic damage and as

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mexico City has been classified as one megacity, its altitude, thermal
   inversions, and high seasonal radiation are factors that prevent
   dispersion of pollutants, which effects are detrimental to health.
   Therefore, it is important to have an organism that allows evaluate the
   damage caused by such exposure, as is the case of mosses that obtain
   nutrients from the atmosphere; this property makes them excellent
   biomonitors to evaluate genotoxic damage caused by exposure to
   pollutants, in addition to its large accumulation capacity. For these
   reasons and to relate the effects of atmospheric pollution with a
   biological response, we propose to use the moss Hypnum amabile as a
   bioaccumulator of atmospheric pollutants and biomonitor of the genotoxic
   effect that the air pollution can induce it through the comet assay.
   Mosses were placed in five localities of Mexico City and the
   metropolitan area on the first days of each month of the dry (cold and
   warm) and rainy seasons, with a 30-day exposure, after which they were
   changed for a new sample (for 8 months). Each month, the moss exposed
   was collected and nuclei were isolated to perform comet assay. To
   demonstrate heavy metal bioaccumulation capacity, samples were observed
   in a transmission electron microscope and qualitative microanalysis by
   scanning electron microscopy was carried out parallel. The chemical
   analysis detected 14 heavy metals by mass spectrometry method with
   inductively coupled plasma source. Additionally, 22 polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons were also determined by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test were
   performed to compare DNA damage of each station against control, which
   was maintained in the laboratory in a chamber with filtered air. This is
   the first study on the genotoxicity of mosses exposed to the atmosphere
   of Mexico City and metropolitan area that in addition to proving their
   accumulation capacity shows their ability to respond to atmospheric
   pollutants.},

Abstract = {Parasites are a selective force that shape communities and ecosystems.
   Hosts represent a food source, habitat, and a way to disperse. In recent

   endoparasites have increased, and soft ticks (Parasitiformes: Ixodida:
   Argasidae) are among the best known. In Mexico, 16 species of soft ticks
   associated with bats have been reported up to now, but there are no
   specific records of soft ticks parasitizing Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in
   the country. Herein, we record for the first time the presence of
   Ornithodoros dyeri parasitizing L. yerbabuenae and report an extension
   of its geographic distribution. The same tick species was also recorded
   from the California leaf-nosed bat (Macrotus californicus). Data on
   prevalence, mean intensity, mean abundance, tick identification, and
   possible scenarios of life cycle associations for O. dyeri and one of
   its hosts, L. yerbabuenae, are discussed.},

Title = {Interaction of graphene with antipsychotic drugs: Is there any charge

Abstract = {Antipsychotics represent an effective therapy for schizophrenia (a
   chronic mental disorder). Their benefits are related to the interaction
   of the drugs with dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). Antipsychotics are
   classified as agonists or antagonists. One of the working hypotheses is
   that there is a charge transfer process between the drugs and the
   receptors, which is different for agonists and antagonists. To have more
   insight into the nature of the interaction of these molecules and the
   differences between agonists and antagonists, we analyze the interaction
   of graphene with three molecules: dopamine, pramipexole (an agonist of
   dopamine), and risperidone (an antagonist of dopamine). The idea is to
   use graphene as a simple model to analyze the charge transfer process of
   these three drugs. Optimized structures, atomic charges, and Density of
   States results indicate that global charges of dopamine and pramipexole
   are similar, while for risperidone, it is more than double. Pramipexole
   is an agonist, and the charge transfer process is similar to that of
   dopamine. Risperidone is an antagonist, and the charge transfer process
   is different from dopamine. The charge transfer is more significant with
   risperidone than with dopamine, and this could be related to the
   mechanism of action. This is in agreement with the working hypotheses
   that establish that it is possible to distinguish between agonists and
   antagonists since they have different capacity to transfer charge.},

   relationships recorded here are new. Furthermore, 3 of the trichodinid
   species found are recorded for the first time for Mexico. Trichodinids
   taxa do not show a noticeable distributional gradient along the BCP,
   which suggests a wide-continuous distribution of the species throughout

Title = {The liver, a functionalized vascular structure},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The liver is not only the largest organ in the body but also the one
   playing one of the most important role in the human metabolism as it is
   in charge of transforming toxic substances in the body. Understanding
   the way its blood vasculature works is key. In this work we show that
   the challenge of predicting the hepatic multi-scale vascular network can
   be met thanks to the constructal law of design evolution. The work
   unveils the structure of the liver blood flow architecture as a
   combination of superimposed tree-shaped networks and porous system. We
   demonstrate that the dendritic nature of the hepatic artery, portal vein
   and hepatic vein can be predicted, together with their geometrical
   features (diameter ratio, duct length ratio) as the entire blood flow
   architectures follow the principle of equipartition of imperfections. At
   the smallest scale, the shape of the liver elemental systems-the
   lobules-is discovered, while their permeability is also predicted. The
   theory is compared with good agreement to anatomical data from the
   literature.},

Abstract = {This work explores the influence of controlled acidification on lipid
   accumulation in S. obtusiusculus AT-UAM under N-deplete conditions. The
   protocol included determination of the acidification procedure (CO2 or
   HCl) and the application chronology in flat panel photobioreactors,
   operated under controlled conditions. The highest lipid content and
   productivity of 60\% g(lipids) g(DCW)(-1) and 85 mg L-1 d(-1),
   respectively, were obtained when controlled acidification to pH of 5.5
   was applied after 80 h of operation under N-depletion. The strategy was
   also applied successfully in a larger scale using different
   configurations such as bubble-column photobioreactors and raceway ponds,
   operated outdoors, yielding a maximum lipid content of 45\% g(lipids)
   g(DCW)(-1) in both systems. Globally, the lipid content increased almost
   twice the value obtained without acidification in indoor and outdoor
   conditions. The analysis revealed that no major changes in fatty acid
   profile occurred, suggesting a high specificity of the microalga toward
   lipid production; however, significant changes in the ultrastructure of
   the subcellular components and the cell wall were observed.},

Title = {Disentangling the effects of legacies from those of current land use on
   soil properties in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {153},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Soil properties are the product of current land use as well as legacies
   of historic use. Disentangling these effects is particularly challenging
   in tropical landscapes where plot-level land use history consists of
   varied sequences of uses punctuated by periods of abandonment. Here, we
   studied the soils of 63 plots in three sites of the Los Tuxtlas
   Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, and used detailed landowner accounts of land
   use history to model the effects of land use and its legacies.
   Electrical conductivity, N-NO3- and ant species richness were higher in
   current land uses featuring developed canopies (forests, secondary
   growth and palm and coffee plantations) compared to intensive land uses
   (livestock pastures and maize-slash and burn). Land uses aimed at soil
   restoration (maize-mucuna and tree plantations on degraded soils)
   improved soil bulk density only with respect to intensive land uses. The
   most frequent effects of historical land use variables (time since
   forest felling and cumulative times under each land use type) on soil
   properties occurred in interaction with each other and independently of
   the current land use. Beta glucosidase activity, pH and nematode
   richness were explained exclusively by historical use. In general, the
   duration of use dictated soil deterioration; however, the accumulation
   of time under intensive land uses had stronger legacies, in terms of
   soil physical and chemical properties, compared to that under
   agroforestry (coffee and palm cultivation). The richness of four taxa
   was sensitive to the land use history variables. Surprisingly, Nematoda
   and plant symbionts (nitrogen fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi) richness, but not that of Coleoptera, increased with accumulated
   time (20-40 yr) under maize cultivation. We suggest that the long
   history of traditional maize cultivation in polycultures has permitted
   the development of a rich soil biota.},

   there was a higher community diversity in TSTn compared to TSTp. Beta
   diversity analysis showed different species composition in TSTp compared
   to TSTn and PTB. There was higher presence of Firmicutes in PTB and TSTn
   compared to TSTp group at phylum level. At the genus level, Leuconostoc
   and Enterococcus were higher in TSTn compared to TSTp and Pediococcus,
   Chryseobacterium, Bifidobacterium, Butyrivibrio, and Bulleidia were
   higher in PTB compared to TSTn. Streptococcus was higher in TSTn
   compared to PTB and Lactobacillus in PTB compared to TSTp. At species
   level, Streptococcus sobrinus and Bulleidia moorei were higher in PTB
   compared to TSTn individuals, while Lactobacillus salivarius was higher
   in PTB compared to TSTp. The differences in the microbiome composition
   could influence the resistance/susceptibility to Mtb infection.},

Abstract = {Let A be an abelian category. For a pair (X, Y) of classes of objects in
   A, we define the weak and the (X, Y)-Gorenstein relative projective
   objects in A: We point out that such objects generalize the usual
   Gorenstein projective objects and other generalizations appearing in the
   literature as Ding-projective, Ding-injective, X-Gorenstein projective,
   Gorenstein AC-projective and GC-projective modules and Cohen-Macaulay
   objects in abelian categories. We show that the principal results on
   Gorenstein projective modules remain true for the weak and the (X,
   Y)-Gorenstein relative objects. Furthermore, by using
   Auslander-Buchweitz appr(Ximation theory, a relative version of
   Gorenstein homological dimension is developed. Finally, we introduce the
   notion of W-cotilting pair in the abelian category A, which is very
   strong connected with the cotorsion pairs related with relative
   Gorenstein objects in A: It is worth mentioning that the W-cotilting
   pairs generalize the notion of cotilting objects in the sense of L.

Title = {Correlates of bird collisions with buildings across three North American
   countries},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Collisions with buildings cause up to 1 billion bird fatalities annually
   in the United States and Canada. However, efforts to reduce collisions
   would benefit from studies conducted at large spatial scales across
   multiple study sites with standardized methods and consideration of
   species- and life-history-related variation and correlates of
   collisions. We addressed these research needs through coordinated
   collection of data on bird collisions with buildings at sites in the
   United States (35), Canada (3), and Mexico (2). We collected all
   carcasses and identified species. After removing records for
   unidentified carcasses, species lacking distribution-wide population
   estimates, and species with distributions overlapping fewer than 10
   sites, we retained 269 carcasses of 64 species for analysis. We
   estimated collision vulnerability for 40 bird species with >= 2
   fatalities based on their North American population abundance,
   distribution overlap in study sites, and sampling effort. Of 10 species
   we identified as most vulnerable to collisions, some have been
   identified previously (e.g., Black-throated Blue Warbler {[}Setophaga
   caerulescens]), whereas others emerged for the first time (e.g.,
   White-breasted Nuthatch {[}Sitta carolinensis]), possibly because we
   used a more standardized sampling approach than past studies. Building
   size and glass area were positively associated with number of collisions
   for 5 of 8 species with enough observations to analyze independently.
   Vegetation around buildings influenced collisions for only 1 of those 8
   species (Swainson's Thrush {[}Catharus ustulatus]). Life history
   predicted collisions; numbers of collisions were greatest for migratory,
   insectivorous, and woodland-inhabiting species. Our results provide new
   insight into the species most vulnerable to building collisions, making
   them potentially in greatest need of conservation attention to reduce
   collisions and into species- and life-history-related variation and
   correlates of building collisions, information that can help refine
   collision management.},

   belongs toBegoniasect.Gireoudiadue to its prostrate, rhizomatous habit
   with radicant leaves, persistent, keeled stipules, staminate and
   pistillate flowers with 2 tepals, zygomorphic androecia with stamens
   whose filaments are arranged free from each other on a common
   receptacle, and 3-locular ovaries. It does, however, differ from the
   other species due to the presence of several characters that are
   uncommon in the section: stipules of each pair joined by a band
   extending from the keels, pubescence of leaves and peduncles consisting
   of multiseriate trichomes, subsymmetric, palmatilobed leaf blades with
   the texture and consistency of fabric, bristly above and pitted below,

Title = {Paraxenisaurus normalensis, a large deinocheirid ornithomimosaur
   from the Cerro del Pueblo Formation (Upper Cretaceous), Coahuila, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {New ornithomimosaur material discovered from the Upper Cretaceous Cerro
   del Pueblo Formation of Coahuila, Mexico is described herein. The
   material includes postcraneal elements from several individuals, which
   are assigned to a new genus and species, Paraxenisaurus normalensis.
   This new taxon is characterized by the presence of a strongly curved and
   laterally compressed manual ungual I with a distally placed flexor
   tubercle divided by a deep sulcus and a deeply concave proximal,
   elliptical-shaped articular surface; a metacarpal III that has an
   expanded proximal articular end, which is similar in width to metacarpal
   II; a combination of posterior caudal vertebrae, where the most anterior
   vertebrae possess low dorsoventral prezygapophyses with nearly vertical
   articulation surfaces, while the most posterior vertebrae have
   prezygapophyses that face ventromedially; a nonarctometatarsalian pes,
   where the proximal end of metatarsal III is expanded and has a proximal
   ovoid outline; the presence of an attachment site for pedal digit I in
   the posterior surface of the distal quarter of metatarsal II; an
   expanded medial condyle of metatarsal II; a transversely wide distal end
   of metatarsal III, which has a semiginglymoid articular surface;
   distinctively broad and ventrally curved pedal unguals that depending on
   the digit, the proximodorsal process changes its position adopting a
   lip-shaped appearance; a rounded, large foramen on the medial side of
   each pedal ungual and the presence of a deep ventral fossa that
   surrounds a strongly developed, ridge-like flexor tubercle. This
   combination of characteristics separate Paraxenisaurus normalensis from
   other ornithomimosaurs previously described in North America and in
   other parts of the world. Phylogenetic analysis shows that within
   Ornithomimosauria, Paraxenisaurus normalensis is recovered as a
   deinocheirid ornithomimosaur, along with Garudimimus brevipes and
   Deinocheirus mirificus. Therefore, the finding of Paraxenisaurus
   normalensis in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation of Coahuila, Mexico
   represents the first record of the Deinocheiridae family in the
   Campanian of North America.},

Title = {Drought tolerance increases with seed size in a semiarid grassland from

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {221},

Abstract = {Due to increased reserves available to face adverse conditions, drought
   tolerance should increase with seed size. This has been confirmed in the
   laboratory, but under field conditions the pattern has not yet been
   found. We tested whether drought tolerance increases with seed size
   under field conditions in a semiarid grassland. We recorded the
   performance (germination, survival, and growth) of 12 species with
   different-sized seeds sown under conditions associated with hydric
   stress: along a natural stress gradient related to soil depth, and under
   experimentally manipulated irradiance levels that affected evaporation
   and thus soil humidity. We estimated drought tolerance indices for each
   performance metric, as well as a multivariate tolerance index that
   integrated the different components of performance. Each index was
   regressed on seed size accounting for phylogenetic effects. Seed size
   had little effect on individual metrics, but the joint evidence from all
   tests revealed a clear positive correlation with seed size. The
   multivariate tolerance index also increased with seed size, confirming
   the expected relationship. This suggests that comprehensive measures
   encompassing the whole life cycle may be required to characterize
   drought tolerance properly and may explain why this pattern has remained
   elusive in most studies. Also, we used a narrow range of seed sizes, so
   there is the possibility that the relationship between seed size and
   tolerance holds only for small-seeded species.},

Abstract = {Halotolerant species are adapted to dealing continually with
   hyperosmotic environments, having evolved strategies that are uncommon
   in other organisms. The HOG pathway is the master system that regulates
   the cellular adaptation under these conditions; nevertheless, apart from
   the importance ofDebaryomyces hanseniias an organism representative of
   the halotolerant class, its HOG1 pathway has been poorly studied, due to
   the difficulty of applying conventional recombinant DNA technology. Here
   we describe for the first time the phenotypic characterisation of a
   nullHOG1mutant ofD. hansenii.Dhhog1 Delta strain was found moderately
   resistant to 1 M NaCl and sensitive to higher concentrations. Under
   hyperosmotic shock, DhHog1 fully upregulated transcription ofDhSTL1and
   partially upregulated that ofDhGPD1. High osmotic stress lead to
   long-term inner glycerol accumulation that was partially dependent on
   DhHog1. These observations indicated that the HOG pathway is required
   for survival under high external osmolarity but dispensable under low
   and mid-osmotic conditions. It was also found that DhHog1 can regulate
   response to alkali stress during hyperosmotic conditions and that it
   plays a role in oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken
   together, these results provide new insight into the contribution of
   this MAPK in halotolerance of this yeast.},

   three species were sequenced at two molecular markers, the small subunit
   (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) of the nuclear rDNA and compared with
   other sequences available in GenBank. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   inference analyses of the combined (LSU + SSU) dataset and each
   individual dataset revealed that the specimens ofLueheiasp. formed an
   independent lineage, which is recognized herein as a new species,Lueheia
   aztecaen. sp., representing the fifth species of the genus in the
   Americas, and the second in the Nearctic region. The new species can be
   morphologically distinguished from the other five species in the genus
   by having a cylindrical proboscis, armed with 24-26 longitudinal rows
   with 9-10 hooks each. Phylogenetic inference performed with the combined
   dataset consisting of two genes (LSU + SSU) revealed thatLueheia
   aztecaen. sp. andP. nickolibelonging to subfamily Porrorchinae, formed
   two independent lineages, indicating that the subfamily is
   paraphyletic.Porrorchis nickoliandC. microcephalusformed a clade with
   other species of the genusCentrorhynchus, suggesting thatP.

Title = {Effectiveness of natural protected areas for preventing land use and
   land cover changes of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Mexico},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Natural protected areas (NPA) are portions of the Mexican territory
   where the original environment has not been modified and which are
   protected in order to conserve, restore, and develop biodiversity. Here,
   we evaluated the effectiveness of 18 NPA located within the Transmexican
   Volcanic Belt by analyzing deforestation and land use and land cover
   change (LULCC) between 2002 and 2014. An index of effectiveness (EI) was
   obtained by adding three parameters: (1) the percentage of the
   transformed area (TA\%), (2) the rate of change inside the NPA
   (LULCC-R), and (3) the difference between the rate of change inside the
   NPA and outside (buffer). The sum of the three standardized parameters
   forms the EI, where NPA were classified as effective (index value > 2),
   weakly effective (index value between 1 and 2), and noneffective (index
   value < 1). In addition, we identified the most important transitions
   between categories of LULCC for each NPA. Only three NPA were classified
   as effective: Cienegas de Lerma (EI = 2.29), Volcan Nevado de Colima (EI
   = 2.08), and Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl (EI = 2.06). Eleven were weakly
   effective, and the remaining four were noneffective. Bosencheve was the
   least effective (with all parameters in 0). In terms of transition
   probabilities in each effectiveness class, effective NPA were
   characterized by transition probabilities of forest cover recovery.
   Weakly effective NPA presented exchange probabilities between forest
   cover and land use. Finally, in noneffective NPA, probabilities
   indicated transitions from forest cover to agricultural and livestock
   land use. Our results show that, in general, NPA are not currently
   effective in containing LULCC processes in the Transmexican Volcanic
   Belt.},

Abstract = {Animal signals evolve by striking a balance between the need to convey
   information through particular habitats and the limitations of what
   types of signals can most easily be produced and perceived. Here, we
   present new results from field measures of undisturbed behavior and
   biochemical analyses of scent marks from 12 species of Sceloporus
   lizards to explore whether evolutionary changes in chemical composition
   are better predicted by measures of species behavior, particularly those
   associated with visual displays, chemoreception, and locomotion, or by
   measures of habitat climate (precipitation and temperature). We found
   that more active lizard species used fewer compounds in their volatile
   scent marks, perhaps conveying less specific information about
   individual and species identity. Scent marks from more active lizard
   species also had higher proportions of saturated fatty acids, and the
   evolution of these compounds has been tracking the phylogeny closely as
   we would expect for a metabolic byproduct. In contrast, the proportions
   of unsaturated fatty acids were better explained by evolutionary shifts
   in habitat temperature (and not precipitation), with species in warmer
   climates using almost no volatile unsaturated fatty acids. The
   proportion of aldehydes was explained by both behavior and environment,
   decreasing with behavioral activity and increasing with habitat
   temperature. Our results highlight the evolutionary flexibility of
   complex chemical signals, with different chemical compounds responding
   to different elements of the selective landscape over evolutionary time.},

Title = {Calling phenology of four anurans in tropical Mexico},
Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Anuran vocalizations transmit relevant information that aids in
   individual recognition and sexual selection by females. When studied
   over time, vocalizations can help us to understand reproductive
   phenology. Here, we used an automated recording system to obtain calls
   of 4 anurans in southeastern Mexico, described the calling phenology of
   the species and tested its relationship with environmental variables. We
   performed Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMM's) to explore
   possible relationships between calling and environmental variables. The
   hylid species (Agalychnis callidryas, A. moreletii and Dendropsophus
   ebraccatus) showed a clear calling pattern; they began calling in
   April/May and increased in their intensity during the rainy season, from
   June to September. Craugastor loki showed, contrarily, no clear patterns
   of calling, preferring to call almost continuously throughout the year.
   Among the environmental factors tested, only minimum temperature and the
   amount of days without rain had an effect (positive and negative,
   respectively) on calling activity of the hylids, but we found that
   calling from other species had greater positive effects within the
   group. There was a strong phenological overlap in the calling behavior
   of these species, which may suggest that competition for site of calling
   or acoustic niche partitioning can be present in the community.},

Abstract = {Sceloporus licki, an endemic lizard of the Cape Region from Baja
   California Sur, Mexico, shows evident sexual dimorphism in coloration
   and in snout-vent length between males and females. The gonadal analysis
   showed that both sexes have a synchronous spring-summer reproductive
   cycle. The males show maximum gonadal activity from March to July; in
   August, they show a rapid regression, and in September, quiescence is
   evident only in some males while in others recrudescence has already
   begun. Finally, in October and November, the process of recrudescence is
   obvious. The females showed some asynchrony, but for most,
   vitellogenesis occurred from April to June and eggs in the oviduct were
   evident in May, June and August. Oviposition occurs in July and August
   and by September or October there is no more gonadal activity in the
   ovaries. The clutch size was 5 +/- 0.2 eggs, and hatchlings appeared in
   May-June and September suggesting that possibly two clutches are
   produced per breeding season. Reproductive activity in both sexes was
   like that of other lizards from temperate environments. However, the
   long period of gonadal recrudescence in both sexes (6 months) and rapid
   regression and quiescence in males of the studied population suggest
   plasticity in gonadal activity.},

Title = {The genetic diversity and phylogeography of Mexican domestic sheep},
Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {187},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Domestic sheep were introduced in Mexico by the Spanish settlers in the
   16th century. Nowadays, Mexico hosts several sheep breeds, adapting and
   evolving in both farming and traditional livestock production systems
   and different climate conditions. Research on the diversity of ovine
   genetic resources is urgently needed to prevent and reverse genetic
   erosion. Despite the relevance of Mexican sheep, data is still limited
   regarding their genetic diversity and history. We analysed the
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from different sheep breeds and
   municipalities of the State of Mexico, together with a large dataset of
   542 sequences from America and the Iberian Peninsula. We identified a
   low genetic diversity in Mexican sheep, all belonging to haplogroup B.
   The phylogenetic analyses revealed low genetic distance among Cuba,
   Mexico, Portugal and Spain sheep populations, suggesting intense gene
   flow. Our results contribute for a better comprehension of the genetic
   diversity of domestic sheep in Mexico and Ibero-America.},

Title = {Genomic consequences of dietary diversification and parallel evolution
   due to nectarivory in leaf-nosed bats},
Journal = {GIGASCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: The New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomids) exhibit a
   diverse spectrum of feeding habits and innovations in their nutrient
   acquisition and foraging mechanisms. However, the genomic signatures
   associated with their distinct diets are unknown. Results: We conducted
   a genomic comparative analysis to study the evolutionary dynamics
   related to dietary diversification and specialization. We sequenced,
   assembled, and annotated the genomes of five Phyllostomid species: one
   insect feeder (Macrotus waterhousii), one fruit feeder (Artibeus
   jamaicensis), and three nectar feeders from the Glossophaginae subfamily
   (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, Leptonycteris nivalis, and Musonycteris
   harrisoni), also including the previously sequenced vampire Desmodus
   rotundus. Our phylogenomic analysis based on 22,388 gene families
   displayed differences in expansion and contraction events across the
   Phyllostomid lineages. Independently of diet, genes relevant for feeding
   strategies and food intake experienced multiple expansions and
   signatures of positive selection. We also found adaptation signatures
   associated with specialized diets: the vampire exhibited traits
   associated with a blood diet (i.e., coagulation mechanisms), whereas the
   nectarivore clade shares a group of positively selected genes involved
   in sugar, lipid, and iron metabolism. Interestingly, in
   fruit-nectar-feeding Phyllostomid and Pteropodids bats, we detected
   positive selection in two genes: AACS and ALKBH7, which are crucial in
   sugar and fat metabolism. Moreover, in these two proteins we found
   parallel amino acid substitutions in conserved positions exclusive to
   the tribe Glossophagini and to Pteropodids. Conclusions: Our findings
   illuminate the genomic and molecular shifts associated with the
   evolution of nectarivory and shed light on how nectar-feeding bats can
   avoid the adverse effects of diets with high glucose content.},

Abstract = {Periodic orbits are the key for understanding classical Hamiltonian
   systems. As we show here, they are the clue for understanding Bertrand's
   result relating the boundedness, flatness, and periodicity of orbits
   with the functional form of the potentials producing them. This result,
   which is known as Bertrand's theorem, was proved in 1883 using classical
   19th century techniques. In this paper, we prove such a result using the
   relationship between the bounded plane and periodic orbits, constants of
   motion, and continuous symmetries in the Hamiltonian system.},

Title = {Climatic affinities of Neotropical species of Capparaceae: an approach

Journal = {BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {193},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-275},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the Neotropics, the distribution of Capparaceae has been historically
   associated with seasonally dry forest (NSDF), but recent taxonomic
   studies have questioned this assumption. Given the environmental
   co-occurrence of species and the need to understand their relationships
   with the ecosystem, we use ecological niche modelling and numerical
   ecology methods to better describe the distribution patterns of
   Capparaceae and their climatic affinities with NSDF. We used the Maxent
   algorithm to model the ecological niches of 104 species of Capparaceae,
   which gave maximum values of the response curves for climatic
   suitability. These values were used to carry out multivariate
   statistical analyses {[}principal components analysis (PCA), non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and discriminant analysis (DA)] to
   identify ecological associations based on climatic similitude among
   species. Both PCA and NMDS showed that annual precipitation,
   precipitation of the wettest quarter and precipitation of the driest
   quarter were the most important climatic variables shaping distributions
   of species and their associations with NSDF, moist tropical forest (MTF)
   and wet tropical forest (WTF). Although we found 72 species associated
   with NSDF as previously reported, DA revealed an overlapping pattern
   among the three ecological/climatic assemblages (NSDF, MTF and WTF).
   This confirms the existence of transition zones and species with wider
   niches. Our results provide an important biogeographical framework of
   ecological patterns for species associated with NSDF, opening new lines
   of research on the reconstruction of distribution in future climatic
   scenarios or palaeo-distributions.},

Title = {Structural and biochemical evidence of the glucose

Abstract = {Activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) enzymes by glucose
   6-phosphate (G6P) and other phospho-sugars is of major physiological
   relevance. Previous kinetic, site-directed mutagenesis and
   crystallographic results are consistent with allosteric activation, but
   the existence of a G6P-allosteric site was questioned and competitive
   activation-in which G6P would bind to the active site eliciting the same
   positive homotropic effect as the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate
   (PEP)-was proposed. Here, we report the crystal structure of the
   PEPC-C-4 isozyme from Zea mays with G6P well bound into the previously
   proposed allosteric site, unambiguously confirming its existence. To
   test its functionality, Asp239-which participates in a web of
   interactions of the protein with G6P-was changed to alanine. The D239A
   variant was not activated by G6P but, on the contrary, inhibited.
   Inhibition was also observed in the wild-type enzyme at concentrations
   of G6P higher than those producing activation, and probably arises from
   G6P binding to the active site in competition with PEP. The lower
   activity and cooperativity for the substrate PEP, lower activation by
   glycine and diminished response to malate of the D239A variant suggest
   that the heterotropic allosteric activation effects of free-PEP are also
   abolished in this variant. Together, our findings are consistent with
   both the existence of the G6P-allosteric site and its essentiality for
   the activation of PEPC enzymes by phosphorylated compounds. Furthermore,
   our findings suggest a central role of the G6P-allosteric site in the
   overall kinetics of these enzymes even in the absence of G6P or other
   phosphosugars, because of its involvement in activation by free-PEP.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that the oocyte plays a very active role in
   promoting the growth of the follicle by directing the differentiation of
   granulosa cells and secreting paracrine growth factors. In turn,
   granulosa cells regulate the development of the oocytes, establishing
   close bidirectional communication between germ and somatic cells. The
   presence of cortical cells with morphological characteristics, similar
   to primordial germ cells that express specific germline markers, stem
   cells and cell proliferation, known as adult cortical germ cells (ACGC)
   have been reported in phyllostomid bats. Using magnetic cell separation
   techniques, dissociation-cellular re-aggregation and organ culture, the
   behaviour of oocytes and ACGC was analyzed by interactingin vitrowith
   mouse ovarian cells. Bat ACGC was mixed with disaggregated ovaries from
   a transgenic mouse that expressed green fluorescent protein. Thein
   vitroreconstruction of the re-aggregates was evaluated. We examined the
   viability, integration, cellular interaction and ovarian morphogenesis
   by detecting the expression of Vasa, pH3, Cx43 and Laminin. Our results
   showed that the interaction between ovarian cells is carried out in the
   adult ovary of two species, without them losing their capacity to form
   follicular structures, even after having been enzymatically dissociated.},

Title = {Beyond Pairwise Interactions: Multispecies Character Displacement in
   Mexican Freshwater Fish Communities},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Volume = {195},

Abstract = {Competition has long been recognized as a central force in shaping
   evolution, particularly through character displacement. Yet research on
   character displacement is biased, as it has focused almost exclusively
   on pairs of interacting species while ignoring multispecies
   interactions. Communities are seldom so simple that only pairs of
   species interact, and it is not clear whether inferences from pairwise
   interactions are sufficient to explain patterns of phenotypes in nature.
   Here, we test for character displacement in a natural system of
   freshwater fishes in western Mexico that contains up to four congeneric
   species of the genus Poeciliopsis. We analyzed body shape differences
   between populations with different numbers of competitors while
   accounting for confounding environmental variables. Surprisingly, we
   found evidence for convergent character displacement in populations of
   P. prolifica, P. viriosa, and P. latidens. We also found that the
   convergence in body shape was not consistently in the same direction,
   meaning that when three or more competitors co-occurred, we did not find
   more extreme body shapes compared with when there were only two
   competitors. Instead, when three or more competitors co-occurred, body
   shape was intermediate between the shape found with a pair of species
   and the shape found with no competitor present. This intermediate shape
   suggests that evolution in multispecies communities likely occurs in
   response to several competitors rather than to simple pairwise
   interactions. Overall, our results suggest that competition among
   multiple species is more complex than simple pairwise competitive
   interactions.},

Abstract = {Given that gravitational waves are the future probes of the Universe, it
   is important to test various physical effects of these on matter. This
   article explores the first-order perturbation, caused by a planar
   gravitational wave, on massless scalar and chiral fermions. We find a
   new propagating mode for the perturbed fields with a new dispersion
   relation by solving inhomogeneous differential equations. We also
   discuss the massive scalar field, and find interesting effects due to
   the gravitational wave. Our results have physical implications for early
   Universe cosmology and also for ground-based observations, where the new
   mode might be able to help in the gravitational waves' detection on
   Earth.},

Title = {The Impact of Education and Age on Metabolic Disorders},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Metabolic disorders, such as obesity, elevated blood pressure,
   dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia have
   all been identified as risk factors for an epidemic of important and
   widespread chronic-degenerative diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and
   cardiovascular disease, that constitute some of the world's most
   important public health challenges. Their increasing prevalence can be
   associated with an aging population and to lifestyles within an
   obesogenic environment. Taking educational level as a proxy for
   lifestyle, and using both logistic and linear regressions, we study the
   relation between a wide set of metabolic biomarkers, and educational
   level, body mass index (BMI), age, and sex as correlates, in a
   population of 1,073 students, academic and non-academic staff at
   Mexico's largest university (UNAM). Controlling for BMI and sex, we
   consider educational level and age as complementary measures-degree and
   duration-of exposure to metabolic insults. Analyzing the role of
   education across a wide spectrum of educational levels (from primary
   school to doctoral degree), we show that higher education correlates to
   significantly better metabolic health when compared to lower levels, and
   is associated with significantly less risk for waist circumference,
   systolic blood pressure, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin,
   triglycerides, high density lipoprotein and metabolic syndrome (all p <
   0.05); but not for diastolic blood pressure, basal insulin, uric acid,
   low density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. We classify each
   biomarker, and corresponding metabolic disorder, by its associated set
   of statistically significant correlates. Differences among the sets of
   significant correlates indicate various aetiologies and the need for
   targeted population-specific interventions. Thus, variables strongly
   linked to educational level are candidates for lifestyle change
   interventions. Hence, public policy efforts should be focused on those
   metabolic biomarkers strongly linked to education, while adopting a
   different approach for those biomarkers not linked as they may be poor
   targets for educational campaigns.},

Abstract = {Size-exclusion chromatography, in conjunction with electrospray
   ionization mass spectrometry, exemplifies a screening methodology to
   identify alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from natural extracts. This
   approach could be used to speed the time of targeting active principles
   from complex matrices, as a substitute for the establishedin
   vitroenzymatic assays which depend on spectrophotometric methods where
   disadvantages including sensitivity to turbidity and substance
   interferences-extract pigmentation, or absorption in the visible light
   region of tested samples-represent factors that affect the chromogenic
   screenings. Gel permeation through a spin size-exclusion column allowed
   separating high-affinity molecules bounded to alpha-glucosidase in
   solution. After acid hydrolysis of the enzyme-ligand complex,
   electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used as a direct detector
   for the ligand. This affinity-directed fractionation was illustrated by
   using a crude extract, semi-purified fractions, and pure active
   glycolipids from moon vine seeds,Ipomoea albaL., Convolvulaceae, in
   addition to acarbose (positive control), which led to the identification
   of albinosides VI (ESI-MSm/z991 {[}M + Na](+)) and VII (ESI-MSm/z975
   {[}M + Na](+)), two tracked high-affinity glycolipids, which
   demonstrated anin vitroinhibitory potential of alpha-glucosidases from
   yeast and rat intestine. Molecular docking predicted that these
   inhibitors bind to the enzyme catalytic site as acarbose.},

Title = {Domestication of aromatic medicinal plants in Mexico: Agastache
   (Lamiaceae)-an ethnobotanical, morpho-physiological, and phytochemical
   analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background Most reports of domesticated plants that involve a
   domestication gradient or inter-specific hybridization in Mexico have
   focused on those used as food. This study provides knowledge about these
   processes in two aromatic medicinal plants, Agastache mexicana
   (Lamiaceae) and A. m. subsp. xolocotziana, widely used in Mexican
   traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal ailments and
   for their sedative effect. Different populations of A. mexicana along a
   gradient of domestication are found in the foothills of the Popocatepetl
   volcano of central Mexico, while in this same area the subsp.
   xolocotziana grows only in the cultivation, possibly a product of
   hybridization between A. mexicana and Agastache palmeri. This study
   links ethnobotanical, morpho-physiological, and phytochemical evidence
   to document the domestication of both taxa as well as elucidates the
   possible hybrid origin of the subsp. xolocotziana. Method We analyze
   three groups of data derived from (1) 80 semi-structured interviews
   aimed at documenting the selection criteria related to the use and
   management of A. mexicana; (2) a cultivation experiment under
   homogeneous conditions, evaluating 21 floral, vegetative, and seed
   characters (that were important according to ethnobotanical information)
   in 97 plants corresponding to 13 populations of the taxa under study;
   and (3) the chemical profiles of the essential oils of these plants by
   means of a thin-layer chromatography. Results By linking the three types
   of evidence, two evolutionary processes are distinguished: (1) A.
   mexicana occurs in the encouraged-cultivated phases of the domestication
   gradient and (2) A. m. subsp. xolocotziana may have originated through
   inbreeding depression or hybridization. These two cultivated plants show
   a domestication syndrome based upon organoleptic differentiation due to
   their dissimilar phytochemical composition and gigantism in flowers,
   seeds, and rhizomes (the last enhancing their asexual reproductive
   capacity). In addition to this, A. mexicana exhibits more intense floral
   pigmentation and foliar gigantism while subsp. xolocotziana presents
   floral albinism and partial seed sterility. Conclusion Two divergent
   evolutionary processes are reported for the domestication of A. mexicana
   as a result of the intensification of its use and management. The
   selection processes of these plants have resulted in alternation of the
   organoleptic properties based upon the divergence of the phytochemical
   composition. Also, gigantism has been selected in culturally preferred
   plant parts and in correlated structures. The preceding characteristics
   reinforce the joint use of these plants in infusion in Mexican
   traditionalmedicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and
   for their sedative effects.},

Title = {Identification of Key Factors Affecting the Trophic State of Four
   Tropical Small Water Bodies},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Due to their dimensions, small and shallow water bodies are more
   sensitive to changes in nutrient load, water flow, and human management.
   The four water bodies studied are small (area <0.01 km(2)), constantly
   supplied by a non-anthropogenic source of nutrients, and these water
   bodies present different trophic states: mesotrophic, eutrophic, and
   hyper-eutrophic. The objective of this study was to identify the key
   environmental factors that created differences in the trophic state of
   these adjacent shallow urban lakes by modeling chlorophyll-a (Chl a)
   through the application of the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR).
   The models (n = 36) explain 45.8-60.6\% (R-2), and predicts 39-52.9\%
   (Q(2)) of the variance. Environmental variables were identified in the
   water bodies as critical factors of trophic state determination, water
   residence time (WRT), ions (e.g., Ca2+), and minerals as hydroxyapatite
   (HAP). These variables were related to processes that could improve
   trophic conditions, such as flushing and phosphorous precipitation.
   Conversely, N-NH3 concentration was associated with nutrient recycling,
   and found to be able to promote eutrophication.},

Abstract = {The tree of life is highly reticulate, with the history of population
   divergence emerging from populations of gene phylogenies that reflect
   histories of introgression, lineage sorting and divergence. In this
   study, we investigate global patterns of oak diversity and test the
   hypothesis that there are regions of the oak genome that are broadly
   informative about phylogeny.
   We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing
   (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing nearly 250 Quercus species to
   infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world's oaks. We use a
   reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method to reconstruct shifts in
   lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling
   biases. We then map the > 20 000 RAD-seq loci back to an annotated oak
   genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and
   phylogenetic support across the phylogeny.
   Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by
   ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia.
   Roughly 60\% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that
   experienced increases in net diversification, probably in response to
   climatic transitions or ecological opportunity.
   The strong support for the phylogeny contrasts with high genomic
   heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal and introgression. Oaks are
   phylogenomic mosaics, and their diversity may in fact depend on the gene
   flow that shapes the oak genome.},

Abstract = {The high levels of Neotropical biodiversity are commonly associated with
   the intense Neogene-Quaternary geological events and climate dynamics.
   Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of two species of
   Neotropical closely related amphibians (R. horribilis and R. marina). We
   combine published data with new mitochondrial DNA sequences and multiple
   nuclear markers, including 12 microsatellites. The phylogenetic analyses
   showed support for grouping the samples in two main clades; R.
   horribilis (Central America and Mexico) and R. marina (South America
   east of the Andes). However, the phylogenetic inferences also show an
   evident mito-nuclear discordance. We use Approximate Bayesian
   Computation (ABC) to test the role of different events in the
   diversification between the two groups recovered. We found that both
   species were affected primarily by a recent Pleistocene divergence,
   which was similar to the divergence estimate revealed by the
   Isolation-with-Migration model, under persistent bidirectional gene flow
   through time. We provide the first evidence that R. horribilis is
   differentiated from the South American R. marina at the nuclear level
   supporting the taxonomic status of R. horribilis, which has been
   controversial for more than a century.},

Title = {Evaluation of five taxa as surrogates for conservation prioritization in
   the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many biotic groups have been proposed as biodiversity surrogates;
   however, using different taxa could provide complementary information
   for choosing conservation priorities. There are two general ways to
   evaluate the performance of surrogates: (1) using cross-taxon congruency
   as an a priori test, before the application of some prioritization
   algorithm to select areas for conservation; and, (2) developing a system
   of priority areas as an a posteriori test. We have used both of these
   tests to evaluate five different taxa (Amphibia, Ayes, Insecta, Mammalia
   and Magnoliopsida) as surrogates for each other; and likewise we
   evaluated three groupings of them (Invertebrates, Vertebrates and
   Plants). We also compared their performance in a priori and a posteriori
   tests based on their richness patterns and prioritization areas for
   conservation within the Transmexican Volcanic Belt. The prioritization
   was run in Zonation software. We evaluated whether the patterns are
   shared among taxa and groupings using two correlation analyses: Pearson
   and modified t test (to correct for spatial autocorrelation). Although
   we found some positive correlations between the richness patterns of
   taxa and groupings, the prioritized areas were uncorrelated. In general,
   the correlations were stronger for mammals and plants, and weaker for
   birds and insects. We found that patterns of richness and rarity
   (obtained through the prioritization) are not shared among taxa and
   groupings. Therefore, if conservation priorities are based on a single
   group and test, there is a high risk of leaving other groups
   unprotected.},

Title = {Growth and Characterization of TCNQ-Doped Ni(II)TAAB Thin Film As a New

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to obtain a pi-conjugated organic semiconductor
   with the macrocycle Ni(II)(TAAB) ({[}tetrabenzo (b, f, j, n)
   {[}1,5,9,13]tetraazacyclohexadecine]Ni(II) and the electronic acceptor
   TCNQ (tetracyano-pi-quinodimethane), in which hydrogen bonds are formed
   between TCNQ and Ni(II)(TAAB). Theoretical calculations based on DFT
   with dispersion force analysis were carried out in order to simulate
   molecular interaction and to establish the nature of the bonds between
   both fragments. Thin films of TCNQ-doped Ni(II)TAAB organic
   semiconductor were obtained through high vacuum evaporation and were
   structurally and morphological characterized by IR spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction analysis (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   absorption coefficient (alpha) and photon energy (h nu) were calculated
   from UV-Vis spectroscopy and used to determine the Tauc band gap of the
   film. This quasi-experimental band gap was compared with that obtained
   by DFT; both results are in the range established for organic
   semiconductors. The electrical properties of the organic semiconductor
   have been obtained from a simple anode|TCNQ-doped Ni(II)TAAB|cathode
   device. The conductivity of this device was determined from electrical
   measurements of I(V). TCNQ-doped Ni(II)TAAB has semiconducting
   characteristics and its conductivity values are of order 10(-5) S
   cm(-1). Band gap determination and the I(V) study were both carried out
   in order to analyze the effect of doped TCNQ in the macrocycle. This
   work suggests that TCNQ-doped Ni(II)TAAB represents an alternative
   approach to obtaining a semiconductor-like behaviour that may be
   suitable for organic electronic applications.},

Title = {Climate change will have an important impact on scorpion's fauna in its

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Scorpions have high levels of endemism and their distributions are
   typically narrow, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in
   their environment. Unfortunately, little is known about the status of
   scorpion conservation worldwide. Here, we compiled information on
   scorpion diversity across the world and highlighted Mexican scorpion
   diversity. We created and overlapped scorpions' hotspots with the
   Mexican system of protected areas. We also modeled the potential
   distribution area of 24 wide distributed scorpion species under current
   and future scenarios to evaluate their vulnerability to climate change
   considering full and null dispersal models, and calculated the
   percentage of their distribution that will be protected by the natural
   protected areas in the future. Our results indicate that while Mexico
   has the greatest diversity of scorpion species compared to any other
   country in the world, these animals are not sufficiently protected by
   the system of natural protected areas under neither current nor under
   future climatic conditions. In terms of climate change vulnerability, we
   assessed the impact to these species if their migration to future more
   climatically suitable areas is not feasible. However, if full migration
   is feasible for species with broad ecological habitats, nine species
   might have a more widespread distribution, including three species with
   medical importance (Centruroides spp.). (C) 2020 Associacao Brasileira

Title = {Apoptotic, necrotic, and antiproliferative activity of diosgenin and

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {871},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {(25R)-spirost-5-en-3 beta-ol, also known as diosgenin (DSG), exerts
   antiproliferative activity on diverse cell lines, induces apoptosis, and
   acts as a chemopreventative agent. However, the relationship between DSG
   glycosides and apoptotic, necrotic, and antiproliferative activity
   remains unclear. It is in this regard that we report the
   antiproliferative, necrotic, and apoptotic activities of DSG and its
   glycoside derivatives: (25R)-spirost-5-en-3 beta-yl
   O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3GD), (25R)-spirost-5-en-3 beta-yl
   O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3GRD); and
   (25R)-spirost-5-en-3 beta-yl O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 ->
   2)-O-{[}alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 -> 4)]-beta-D-glucopyranoside), also
   known as dioscin (DSC), in in vitro assays of cervical HeLa and CaSki
   cancer cells. The results demonstrated that DSG glycosidic derivatives
   preserved their antiproliferative activity. However, in both cancer cell
   lines, 3GD and 3GRD were less potent than DSG, while DSC was more potent
   than DSG. With respect to necrotic activity, all tested compounds showed
   no or low activity on the two cervical cancer cell lines. Regarding
   apoptosis, the results showed that DSG glycosides were better
   apoptosis-inducers than DSG, suggesting that glucose and rhamnose
   residues play a central role in enhancing the apoptotic activity of DSG.
   Finally, DSG and its glycosidic derivatives were shown to affect the
   proliferative potential of lymphocytes (non-tumour cells) to a lesser
   extent than cancer cells, suggesting that these compounds have selective
   action. In conclusion, the results indicate that DSG and its glycosidic
   derivatives are promising anticancer compounds since they are compounds
   with low necrotic activity and selective action.},

Abstract = {This manuscript reports the discovery of Tzimol. This is a new
   paleontological site of Campanian age belonging to the Angostura
   Formation that is quarried with commercial purposes by local people of
   the Ochuxhob town, Municipality of Tzimol, Chiapas, Mexico. The fossil
   assemblage recovered from Tzimol is rich, diverse, and contains
   well-preserved specimens, which allows to identify this site as a new
   Lagerstatte in the southeastern end of North America. The assemblage
   includes microfossils as foraminifera and algae; as well as macrofossils
   of plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. The plants are represented by
   possible fruits, leaves, and remains of conifers and palms. The
   invertebrates include scarce bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, and
   echinoderms. The vertebrates are mainly different groups of fishes and a
   single mosasaur. Among these, the fossils as far identified include
   echinoid belonging to indeterminate hemiasterids, the rudist Radiolites
   acutocostata that support the Campanian age of these strata, fish
   remains of Nursallia, Saurodon, and Enchodus previously known in Mexico,
   as well as the first discovery of Apuliadercetis in America. Here,
   fishes are the best-preserved fossils, their bones are often articulated
   or otherwise scattered very close, and under UV light, large fishes show
   phosphatized muscles preserved. The lithological features and fossil
   diversity observed in Tzimol suggest that it was deposited into a marine
   environment shallow and of low energy, like a lagoon. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {The role of the interfaces on the optoelectronical properties of
   porphyrin-fullerene composites has been studied by means of
   ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and Raman spectroscopy, atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) and electric conductivity measurements. A simple method
   of synthesis of donor-acceptor complexes has been performed by
   subsequent deposition of C-60 fullerene and tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP)
   thin films, using physical vapor deposition (PVD) on a (100) silicon
   substrate. UV-Vis spectra showed that the interaction of pi-orbitals
   leads to a more ordering for the dipole moments arrangement and the
   pi-orbitals overlapping between C-60 and H2TPP molecules. Besides, Raman
   spectra presented intensity changes at 960 and 1000 cm(-1), both related
   to the vibration of the pyrrole ring and the rocking of the H on the C
   atoms within the macrocycle. Therefore, it can be expected that the
   interface C-60-H2TPP should have a main role in the electric response of
   the multilayer films. The measurements of surface conductivity indicated
   that interface has specific contribution, and the value of surface
   conductivity is enhanced by charge delocalization mechanisms occur by
   pi-pi stacking interactions. It was found that the transversal
   conductivity of 3-layer films was enhanced by a factor of 4 in
   comparison to 2-layer film, due to charge transfer mechanisms occur in
   the junctions that could extend the diffusion length of the charge
   carriers. Finally, the interface generated between C-60 and H2TPP films,
   without any linking molecule, enhance charge transport mechanism through
   the films.},

Abstract = {We study the marine and terrestrial contributions in the Gulf of
   California (GC) to understand the relationship between continental
   climate and oceanographic variability over the last 28 ka. In Core
   AII125-8-JPC-20, we examine aeolian and riverine inputs as nutrients for
   biological productivity. We use biogenic silica (\%opal), total organic
   carbon (\%TOC) and calcium carbonate (\%CaCO3) as proxies for primary
   productivity, and lithic fraction distributions as proxies for
   terrigenous transport. At the core site, biogenic and lithic components
   are in phase at millennial-scale in response to regional climate
   conditions. During the Late Pleistocene, the GC shelf area was above sea
   level and the western margin showed transient episodes of increased
   fluvial inputs. Episodic increases in \%opal and reduced \%TOC suggest
   upwelling events but ineffective C-export to the sediment. During
   stadial events (Heinrich 2, Heinrich 1, Younger Dryas), regional
   declines in \%opal, but increases in \%CaCO3 and TOC, suggest efficient
   C-export by carbonate organisms. During most of the Holocene, dust
   inputs are higher. Episodic increases in \%TOC suggest higher
   C-accumulation, although this is not controlled by siliceous or
   calcareous organisms. In the GC, besides upwelling and current
   advection, nutrient inputs driven by terrestrial climate have an impact
   on the biological C-pump.},

Title = {Strict dissipativity of Cattaneo-Christov systems for compressible fluid
   flow},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Number = {6},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {This work considers a compressible, heat-conducting fluid exhibiting
   thermal relaxation according to Christov's constitutive heat transfer
   law (Christov 2009 Mech. Res. Commun. 36 481-6), which is of Cattaneo
   type. The resulting evolution equations are known as Cattaneo-Christov
   systems. In this contribution, it is shown that Cattaneo-Christov
   systems for one-dimensional compressible fluid flow are strictly
   dissipative in both the viscous and inviscid cases. The proof is based
   on the verification of a genuine coupling condition for
   hyperbolic-parabolic systems with viscous and relaxation effects
   combined as well as on showing the existence of compensating functions
   of the state variables in the sense of Shizuta and Kawashima (1985
   Hokkaido Math. J. 14 249-75). This property is used to obtain linear
   decay rates for solutions to the linearized equations around equilibrium
   states.},

Title = {Cryopreservation induces higher oxidative stress levels in Bos
   indicus embryos compared with Bos taurus},
Journal = {THERIOGENOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {74-81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Freezing and thawing of Bos indicus embryos affect their quality for
   embryo transfer. The objective of this study was to compare the levels
   of reactive oxygen species between Bos indicus and Bos taurus embryos
   produced in vivo, before and after conventional freezing, as well as to
   analyze damage caused by apoptosis and lipid peroxidation. Bos indicus
   has higher levels of reactive oxygen species than Bos taurus embryos,
   both fresh (14.32 +/- 1.41 auf vs 8.07 +/- 1.15 auf (arbitrary units of
   fluorescence), P < 0.05) and after freezing (20.91 +/- 1.21 auf vs 14.39
   +/- 0.58 auf, P < 0.05). The number of apoptotic nuclei is also
   significantly higher in Bos indicus embryos than Bos taurus (8.28 +/-
   0.80 vs 1 +/- 0.57, P < 0.05) but highlighting a notable increase after
   the freeze-thaw process in both subspecies (Bos indicus from 8.28 +/-
   0.80 to 10.71 +/- 0.42, P < 0.05; Bos taurus from 1 +/- 0.57 to 5.5 +/-
   1.15, P < 0.05). Finally, although lipid peroxidation is lower in Bos
   indicus embryos before freezing in comparison with Bos taurus (2.46 +/-
   0.14 vs 4.20 +/- 0.51), the effect after the freeze-thaw process showed
   an increase of 4.34 in Bos indicus than Bos taurus embryos (51.45 +/-
   5.52 auf vs 11.85 +/- 2.88 auf, P < 0.05). In conclusion, in comparison
   with Bos taurus, Bos indicus embryos undergo greater oxidative stress
   causing increases in the cryopreservation process, promoting major cell
   damage and lowering embryonic viability. (C) 2019 Elsevier inc. All

Title = {Precipitous decline of white-lipped peccary populations in Mesoamerica},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores are experiencing population reductions and
   range declines. However, we lack regional knowledge of population status
   for many herbivores, particularly in developing countries. Addressing
   this knowledge gap is key to implementing tailored conservation
   strategies for species whose population declines are highly variable
   across their range. White-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) are
   important ecosystem engineers in Neotropical forests and are highly
   sensitive to human disturbance. Despite maintaining a wide
   distributional range, white-lipped peccaries are experiencing
   substantial population declines in some portions of their range. We
   examined the regional distribution and population status of the species
   in Mesoamerica. We used a combination of techniques, including
   expert-based mapping and assessment of population status, and
   data-driven distribution modelling techniques to determine the status
   and range limits of white-lipped peccaries. Our analysis revealed
   declining and highly isolated populations of peccaries across
   Mesoamerica, with a range reduction of 87\% from historic distribution
   and 63\% from current IUCN range estimates for the region. White-lipped
   peccary distribution is affected by indices of human influence and
   forest cover, and more restricted than other sympatric large herbivores,
   with their largest populations confined to transboundary reserves. To
   conserve white-lipped peccaries in Mesoamerica, transboundary efforts
   will be needed that focus on both forest conservation and hunting
   management, increased cross-border coordination, and reconsideration of
   country and regional conservation priorities. Our methodology to detail
   regional white-lipped peccary status could be employed on other
   poorly-known large mammals.},

   Mesoamerican Diet?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican diet was characterized by being diverse,
   nutritionally balanced, and for integrating a remarkable diversity of
   plants and hundreds of animal species, mainly insects, fish, amphibians,
   and reptiles. In recent years, countries that used to have traditional
   healthy diets (e.g., Mexico, China, and India), now present some of the
   highest rates of diabetes, obesity, and overweight. The rise of
   non-communicable diseases (NCD) has been linked to the global
   consumption of highly processed foods, refined sugars, fats, and flours,
   typical to the Western diet. Additionally, the environmental footprint
   of the latter is high, as it requires large agricultural areas, great
   quantities of pesticides, and produces large amounts of greenhouse
   gases. Here, we show that by diversifying our current eating habits
   through the consumption of products that once were part of traditional
   diets, we could lower the prevalence of NCD, reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions, promote crop diversification, reduce extinction risk of
   species due to human activities, and at the same time, reincorporate
   traditions into socioeconomic processes. To this end, we reviewed World
   Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and
   World Bank databases and assessed information on health, agricultural,
   and environmental variables for the countries with the highest incidence
   of NCD, over the last 40 years. Furthermore, we focused on Mexico
   because it is home to the pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican world, but currently
   displays the highest mortality rates due to diabetes, obesity, and
   overweight. This country also presents an important rate of land-use
   change, among other negative environmental issues resulting from the
   adoption of the Western diet. All these factors place Mexico as an
   interesting case study. Finally, to mitigate the main health,
   environmental, and agricultural problems, we suggest that public
   policies around the world should strive to promote the inclusion of
   native products from local ancestral diets into daily meals.},

Abstract = {Multiple species of viruses circulate in wild mammals, some of them
   potentially causing zoonosis. Most of the suspected viral zoonotic
   diseases affecting human patients remain unidentified with regard to
   their aetiological agent. The aim of this study is to summarize the
   state of knowledge of the viral richness associated with wild mammals in
   Mexico throughout 1900-2018 and their relationship with human cases. We
   compiled two databases, one of them containing all available published
   studies on potentially zoonotic viruses in wild mammals and another with
   human cases related to zoonotic viruses. The database on wild mammals
   covers the period of 1900-2018; the human case database spans 2000-2013.
   We calculated the richness of viral potential zoonotic agents and
   evaluated their geographical distribution. We found 262 records of 42
   potential zoonotic viral species associated with 92 wild mammal species
   in 28 states across Mexico. Records of human viral cases were only found
   in 29 states, which did not overlap with the reports in wild mammals. We
   detected 25.6\% (42/164) of viral zoonotic agents reported worldwide.
   This analysis opens a relevant topic of discussion for public health
   attention.},

Abstract = {Let D be a digraph and A and B two subsets of PD, where PD = \{P: P is a
   non trivial finite path in D\}. A subset N of V(D) is said to be an
   (A,B)-kernel of D if: (1) for every \{u,v\} subset of N there exists no
   uv-path P such that P is an element of A (N is A-independent), (2) for
   every vertex x in V(D)\textbackslash{}N there exist y in N and P in B
   such that P is an xy-path (N is B-absorbent). As a particular case, the
   concept of (A,B)-kernel generalizes the concept of kernel when A = B =
   A(D). A classical result in kernel theory is Richardson's theorem which
   establishes that if D is a finite digraph without odd cycles, then D has
   a kernel. In this paper, the original results are sufficient conditions
   for the existence of (A,B)-kernels in possibly infinite digraphs, in
   particular we will present some generalizations of Richardson's theorem
   for infinite digraphs. Also we will deduce some conditions for the
   existence of kernels by monochromatic paths, H-kernels and (k,l)-kernels
   in possibly infinite digraphs.},

Abstract = {A new species of the nematode Triumphalisnema Kloss, 1962
   (Oxyuridomorpha), is described from the wood beetle Proculejus hirtus
   Truqui from the mountain mesophilic forest in Hidalgo State, Mexico.
   Triumphalisnema zuuei n. sp. is distinguished from the other 4 congeners
   species by the presence of an expanded cervical ring, well-developed
   lateral alae, an obtuse cauda with a short and bifurcated caudal
   appendage, series of cuticular folds at ventral and dorsal body surface
   from excretory pore level to anal region, and ellipsoidal eggs
   ornamented with numerous small mushroom-like structures over the
   surface. The phylogenetic position of the new species is inferred based
   on a Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analysis of partial
   sequences of 18S SSU rRNA. The phylogenetic analysis showed that
   Triumphalisnema zuuei n. sp., the only representative of the
   Traklosiidae in our study, is closely related to Coynema poeyi and
   species of Longior, Hystrignathus, and Lepidonema, all of them members
   of Hystrignathidae. These relationships are supported by high support
   values. The present study increases to 5 the number of species assigned
   to Triumphalisnema, all of them parasites of Passalidae. Additionally, a
   taxonomic key to the species of the genus is provided.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-136},
Abstract = {The Capparaceae are a family of plants associated mainly with dry areas,
   which have produced climatic constraints and a limited geographic
   distribution. This family is considered endemic in the Neotropical
   seasonally dry forest (NSDF) and, therefore, a model to analyse the NSDF
   biogeography. We conducted a track analysis of Neotropical species of
   Capparaceae to identify generalised tracks that recover ancestral biotas
   of NSDF nuclei, employing 7602 data points for 104 species. Individual
   tracks were obtained using Prim's algorithm and generalised tracks were
   identified using parsimony analysis of endemicity with progressive
   character elimination. We found six generalised tracks and four
   panbiogeographic nodes mainly located in the NSDF. Generalised tracks
   recovered the ancestral biotas of NSDF distributed among the central
   Andean coast, central inter-Andean valleys (Ecuador),
   Tarapoto-Quillabamba, Apurimac-Mantaro (Peru) and Piedmont (Bolivia)
   NSDF nuclei. Also, the pattern of distribution of Capparaceae recovered
   old connections between northern South America and the inter-Andean
   valleys. However, we also found generalised tracks located over the
   Isthmus of Panama and Amazonian-Magdalena valley moist forest,
   suggesting that the distribution pattern in this family was influenced
   not only by NSDF climatic constraints, but also by geological events
   such as the emergence of the Isthmus and Andean uplift.},

Title = {Participation of Extracellular Vesicles from Zika-Virus-Infected

Journal = {CELLS},

Abstract = {To date, no safe vaccine or antivirals for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection
   have been found. The pathogenesis of severe Zika, where host and viral
   factors participate, remains unclear. For the control of Zika, it is
   important to understand how ZIKV interacts with different host cells.
   Knowledge of the targeted cellular pathways which allow ZIKV to
   productively replicate and/or establish prolonged viral persistence
   contributes to novel vaccines and therapies. Monocytes and endothelial
   vascular cells are the main ZIKV targets. During the infection process,
   cells are capable of releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are
   mediators of intercellular communication. We found that mosquito EVs
   released from ZIKV-infected (C6/36) cells carry viral RNA and ZIKV-E
   protein and are able to infect and activate naive mosquito and mammalian
   cells. ZIKV C6/36 EVs promote the differentiation of naive monocytes and
   induce a pro-inflammatory state with tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression. ZIKV C6/36 EVs participate in endothelial
   vascular cell damage by inducing coagulation (TF) and inflammation
   (PAR-1) receptors at the endothelial surface of the cell membranes and
   promote a pro-inflammatory state with increased endothelial
   permeability. These data suggest that ZIKV C6/36 EVs may contribute to
   the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection in human hosts.},

Abstract = {Let D=(V(D),A(D)) be a digraph and S a subset of vertices of D, S is an
   absorbent set if for every v in V(D)\textbackslash{}S there exists a
   vertex u in S such that (v,u)is an element of A(D). A subset S of V(D)
   is a semicomplete absorbent set if S is absorbent and the induced
   subdigraph DS is semicomplete. The minimum (respectively maximum) of the
   cardinalities of the semicomplete absorbent sets is the lower
   (respectively upper) semicomplete absorbent number, denoted by gamma
   sas(D) (respectively Gamma sas(D)). In this paper we introduce the
   concept of semicomplete absorbent set; we will show some structural
   properties on the digraphs which have a semicomplete absorbent set and
   we will present some bounds for gamma sas(D) and Gamma sas(D). Then we
   will study the Cartesian product, the composition of digraphs and the
   line digraph in relation with those numbers.},

Abstract = {From January 2008 to December 2009, 451 specimens of witch
   guitarfishZapteryx xysterwere caught in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Total
   weight, total length (TL), sex, maturity stage and catch depth were
   recorded for each specimen. Maturity stage distribution exhibited
   significant differences with respect to depth. The data indicated that
   adults migrated towards shallow waters (25-37 m) to reproduce, starting
   in February. Males reached maturity at 44 cm TL, whereas females reached
   maturity at 48 cm TL. Witch guitarfish females are synchronous;
   therefore, ovulation and mating begin in March and parturition begins in
   April. Females showed a 2-year cycle with consecutive vitellogenesis and
   gestation. Fecundity was five to eight embryos (mean six embryos) and
   the sex ratio of embryos was 1 : 1. Birth occurred in April and May,
   with an average size at parturition of 17.3 cm TL. There was sexual
   dichromatism between males and females during the breeding period, and
   sexual polymorphism in adult females. The incidental catch of the witch
   guitarfish during courtship and mating threatens the survival of this
   species.},

Title = {Demographic and spatial responses of resident bird populations to the

Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-118},

Abstract = {Long-distance migration allows many bird species to overcome the severe
   climatic changes that occur in seasonal environments. Migration is
   highly demanding, and given its cyclical nature, we currently know that
   it has substantial effects on the population parameters of migratory
   birds during both breeding and wintering seasons. However, the potential
   effects of the presence of migratory birds in their wintering grounds on
   populations of resident birds have remain largely unexplored. Here, we
   propose the hypothesis that migratory birds negatively affect the
   habitat occupancy and population abundance of resident birds because of
   the arrival of numerous individuals during the most limiting months of
   the year. Here, we studied different species of migratory and resident
   birds that coexist during winter in an urban ecological reserve located
   within Mexico City. We used single-species multiseason occupancy models,
   two-species occupancy models, and distance sampling techniques to
   evaluate changes in occupancy and population density of resident bird
   species during three consecutive winters. We found an aggregation
   pattern between two resident species (Psaltriparus minimus and
   Thryomanes bewickii) with three migratory warblers (Cardellina pusilla,
   Setophaga coronata and Setophaga townsendi). Thus, our results provide
   evidence of the formation of mixed-species flocks in our study area. We
   also conclude that resident birds experience different demographic and
   behavioral processes during winter that not necessarily result from
   interspecific interactions with migratory birds.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of sequestrate Hysterangiaceae fungi in Mexico is very
   limited. In the present study, a new member of the family, Aroramyces
   guanajuatensis sp. nov., is described. This speciesis closely related to
   A. balanosporus, but differs from the latter in possessing a tomentose
   peridium 165-240 mu m thick, with occasional large terminal hyphae up to
   170 mu m, a variable mesocutis (isodiametric to angular), and distinct
   bright yellowish subcutis. In contrast, A. balanosporus possesses a
   fibrillose peridial surface with shorter hyphae, a peridium 200-450 pm
   thick, and a mainly hyaline isodiametric mesocutis with a slightly wider
   subcutis. The phylogenetic analysis of the LSU gene separated A.
   guanajuatensis from A. balanosporus with a Bayesian posterior
   probability (PP) = 1. This is the third Aroramyces species described for
   the American continent.},

Title = {Regional context and dispersal mode drive the impact of landscape
   structure on seed dispersal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Land-use change modifies the spatial structure of tropical landscapes,
   shaping global biodiversity patterns. Yet, it remains unknown how key
   ecological processes, such as seed dispersal, can be affected by changes
   in landscape patterns, and whether such effects differ among regions
   with different climate and disturbance intensity. We assessed the effect
   of five landscape metrics (forest cover, matrix openness, forest edge
   density, forest fragmentation, and interpatch distance) on the seed rain
   recorded in two Mexican fragmented regions (20 forest sites per region):
   the more deforested, defaunated, and windy Los Tuxtlas rainforest (LTX),
   and the better-preserved Lacandona rainforest (LAC). We quantified the
   proportions of dispersed tree species and their seeds, separately
   evaluating wind- and animal-dispersed species. Our findings support the
   hypothesis that forest loss is more important than fragmentation per se,
   negatively impacting the seed rain in both regions. As expected,
   landscape patterns were comparatively more important for wind-dispersed
   seeds in LTX, probably because of stronger wind events in this region.
   Specifically, proportions of wind-dispersed seeds and species decreased
   with increasing edge density, suggesting that forest edges prevent
   dispersal of wind-dispersed species, which may occur if edges create
   physical barriers that limit wind flow. This pattern can also be caused
   by source limitation in landscapes with more forest edges, as tree
   mortality rates usually increase at forest edges. The wind-dispersed
   seed rain was also positively related to matrix openness, especially in
   LTX, where wind flow can be favored by the dominance of treeless
   anthropogenic matrices. Surprisingly, the proportion of animal-dispersed
   seeds in LTX was positively related to matrix openness and patch
   isolation, suggesting that seed dispersers in more deforested regions
   may be forced to concentrate in isolated patches and use the available
   habitat more intensively. Yet, as expected, patch isolation limited
   wind-dispersed seeds in LAC. Therefore, dispersal (and potentially
   regeneration) of wind-dispersed trees is favored in regions exposed to
   stronger wind events, especially in landscapes dominated by regularly
   shaped patches surrounded by open areas. Conversely, animal-dispersed
   seeds are primarily favored by increasing forest cover. Preventing
   forest loss is therefore critical to promote animal seed dispersal and
   forest recovery in human-modified rainforests.},

Abstract = {The similarities and variations in nudibranch species of the
   ``Chromodoris quadricolor group{''} (Heterobranchia, Nudibranchia) have
   historically created identification problems among both nudibranch
   enthusiasts and experts. In this study, we combine molecular genetic
   analyses using one nuclear gene (histone h3) and two mitochondrial genes
   (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and ribosomal 16S RNA) with
   morphological data to ameliorate the identification of specimens from
   this complex in East Africa. We include a detailed examination of
   polymorphisms within the group. As a result, Chromodoris boucheti is
   synonymized with Chromodoris lochi, and two new species are described,
   Chromodoris celinae sp. nov. and Chromodoris helium sp. nov. Chromodoris
   celinae sp. nov. is a common shallow water species that was previously
   misidentified as C. hamiltoni. Chromodoris helium sp. nov. is a species
   that appears to be restricted to depths below 30 m. This study agrees
   with previous research indicating the recent divergence of the genus
   Chromodoris.},

Abstract = {Macroecologists seek to identify drivers of community turnover
   (beta-diversity) through broad spatial scales. However, the influence of
   local habitat features in driving broad-scale beta-diversity patterns
   remains largely untested, owing to the objective challenges of
   associating local-scale variables to continental-framed datasets. We
   examined the relative contribution of local- versus broad-scale drivers
   of continental beta-diversity patterns, using a uniquely suited dataset
   of cave-dwelling spider communities across Europe (35-70 degrees
   latitude). Generalized dissimilarity modelling showed that geographical
   distance, mean annual temperature and size of the karst area in which
   caves occurred drove most of beta-diversity, with differential
   contributions of each factor according to the level of subterranean
   specialization. Highly specialized communities were mostly influenced by
   geographical distance, while less specialized communities were mostly
   driven by mean annual temperature. Conversely, local-scale habitat
   features turned out to be meaningless predictors of community change,
   which emphasizes the idea of caves as the human accessible fraction of
   the extended network of fissures that more properly represents the
   elective habitat of the subterranean fauna. To the extent that the
   effect of local features turned to be inconspicuous, caves emerge as
   experimental model systems in which to study broad biological patterns
   without the confounding effect of local habitat features.},

Title = {Population dynamics of three lizard species from the genus
   Sceloporus: short-term changes in demographic parameters},

Abstract = {Most demographic studies focus on numerical changes that occur within
   populations across years. However, typically studies at an interannual
   scale do not provide information on the particular times of the year
   (particular months or seasons) when rates of survival, recruitment, or
   migration increase or decrease due to physiological, behavioral or
   ecological processes. These monthly or seasonal changes in demographic
   parameters may lead to substantial variations in population abundance.
   In this study, we collected capture-mark-recapture data on 3 species of
   lizards of the genus Sceloporus (Sceloporus torquatus, Sceloporus
   grammicus and Sceloporus megalepidurus) found in ecologically similar
   habitats to examine potential changes in demographic rates among 3
   different climatic seasons: rainy, cold-dry and warm-dry seasons. We
   tested different hypotheses about the effect of these seasons on
   survival, recruitment of new adults, and temporary emigration. We found
   that during the season with severe thermal constraints, the cold-dry
   season, survival of S. torquatus decreased markedly. We also detected a
   considerable increase in the recruitment rate of S. grammicus during the
   rainy season, when these lizards are establishing territories and
   finding mates. In contrast, we found no evidence of intra-annual changes
   in the rate of temporary emigration. In addition, we calculated
   abundance and population growth rates for each species and for each
   season. Our study represents a significant contribution to the
   understanding of intra-annual demographic variation in lizards.},

Title = {Continental data on cave-dwelling spider communities across Europe
   (Arachnida: Araneae)},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Background
   Spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) are widespread in subterranean ecosystems
   worldwide and represent an important component of subterranean trophic
   webs. Yet, global-scale diversity patterns of subterranean spiders are
   still mostly unknown. In the frame of the CAWEB project, a European
   joint network of cave arachnologists, we collected data on cave dwelling
   spider communities across Europe in order to explore their continental
   diversity patterns. Two main datasets were compiled: one listing all
   subterranean spider species recorded in numerous subterranean localities
   across Europe and another with high resolution data about the
   subterranean habitat in which they were collected. From these two
   datasets, we further generated a third dataset with individual
   geo-referenced occurrence records for all these species.
   New information
   Data from 475 geo-referenced subterranean localities (caves, mines and
   other artificial subterranean sites, interstitial habitats) are herein
   made available. For each subterranean locality, information about the
   composition of the spider community is provided, along with local
   geomorphological and habitat features. Altogether, these communities
   account for > 300 unique taxonomic entities and 2,091 unique
   geo-referenced occurrence records, that are made available via the
   Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Mammola and Cardoso
   2019). This dataset is unique in that it covers both a large geographic
   extent (from 35 south to 67 degrees north) and contains high-resolution
   local data on geomorphological and habitat features. Given that this
   kind of high-resolution data are rarely associated with broad-scale
   datasets used in macroecology, this dataset has high potential for
   helping researchers in tackling a range of biogeographical and
   macroecological questions, not necessarily uniquely related to
   arachnology or subterranean biology.},

Title = {Geographic variation in morphology in the Mohave Rattlesnake
   (Crotalusscutulatus Kennicott 1861) (Serpentes: Viperidae):
   implications for species boundaries},

Abstract = {The Mohave Rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus) is a highly venomous
   pitviper inhabiting the arid interior deserts, grasslands, and savannas
   of western North America. Currently two subspecies are recognized . the
   Northern Mohave Rattlesnake (C. s. scutulatus) ranging from southern
   California to the southern Central Mexican Plateau, and the Huamantla
   Rattlesnake (C. s. salvini) from the region of Tlaxcala, Veracruz, and
   Puebla in south-central Mexico. Although recent studies have
   demonstrated extensive geographic variation in venom composition and
   cryptic genetic diversity in this species, no modern studies have
   focused on geographic variation in morphology. Here we analyzed a series
   of qualitative, meristic, and morphometric traits from 347 specimens of
   C. scutulatus and show that this species is phenotypically cohesive
   without discrete subgroups, and that morphology follows a continuous
   cline in primarily color pattern and meristic traits across the major
   axis of its expansive distribution. Interpreted in the context of
   previously published molecular evidence, our morphological analyses
   suggest that multiple episodes of isolation and secondary contact among
   metapopulations during the Pleistocene were sufficient to produce
   distinctive genetic populations, which have since experienced gene flow
   to produce clinal variation in phenotypes without discrete or
   diagnosable distinctions among these original populations. For taxonomic
   purposes, we recommend that C. scutulatus be retained as a single
   species, although it is possible that C. s. salvini, which is
   morphologically the most distinctive population, could represent a
   peripheral isolate in the initial stages of speciation.},

Abstract = {Extensive efforts have been made to explore how the activities of
   multiple brain cells combine to alter physiology through imaging and
   cell-specific manipulation in different animal models. However, the
   temporal regulation of peripheral organs by the neuroendocrine factors
   released by the brain is poorly understood. We have established a suite
   of adaptable methodologies to interrogate in vivo the relationship of
   hypothalamic regulation with the secretory output of the pituitary
   gland, which has complex functional networks of multiple cell types
   intermingled with the vasculature. These allow imaging and optogenetic
   manipulation of cell activities in the pituitary gland in awake mouse
   models, in which both neuronal regulatory activity and hormonal output
   are preserved. These methodologies are now readily applicable for
   longitudinal studies of short-lived events (e.g., calcium signals
   controlling hormone exocytosis) and slowly evolving processes such as
   tissue remodeling in health and disease over a period of days to weeks.},

Title = {Wood anatomy of dominant species with contrasting ecological performance

Abstract = {Environmental restrictions faced by successional species (those
   occurring in recovering vegetation) change gradually between early and
   late succession. In tropical dry forest (TDF), legume species dominate
   early succession, that is, accumulate more biomass than coexisting
   species, but later are gradually replaced by late successional species.
   Stem anatomical traits are involved in water conduction efficiency and
   safety, and thus biomass accumulation. We hypothesized that anatomical
   characteristics of dominant species may explain their status in their
   respective successional community. We analyzed the wood anatomy of TDF
   dominant successional species: Mimosa eurycarpa and M. tenuiflora (early
   successional), Lysiloma divaricatum (late successional), and Euphorbia
   schlechtendalii (successionally ambiguous). Anatomical variables and
   indices were estimated and compared between species through linear
   modeling. Unexpectedly, Mimosa species differed in porosity type, which
   is one characteristic linked to water stress tolerance. M. eurycarpa and
   L. divaricatum are ring-porous (an uncommon feature in tropical
   species), whereas M. tenuiflora and E. schlechtendalii displayed diffuse
   porosity. M. eurycarpa had the lowest vulnerability index (VI) and the
   highest relative hydraulic conductivity. Within-individual differences
   in relative water conduction in ring-porous species, driven by high
   vessel density in earlywood and low VI in latewood, likely represent a
   highly advantageous strategy in water-stressed successional
   environments.},

Title = {Some Conditions for the Existence of Euler H-trails},

Abstract = {In viewof the interesting applications of alternatingEuler trails, it is
   natural to ask about the existence of Euler trails fulfilling some
   restriction other than alternating. Let H be a graph possiblywith loops
   and G amultigraph without loops. G is said to be H-colored if there
   exists a function c : E(G). V(H). A trailW = (v0, e0, v1, e1,..., ek-1,
   vk) in G is an H-trail if and only if (c(e0), a0, c(e1),..., c(ek-2),
   ak-2, c(ek-1)) is awalk in H with ai = c(ei) c(ei+ 1) for every i in
   \{0,..., k -2\}. In particular an H-trail is a properly colored trail
   when H is a complete graph without loops. An H-trail T = (v0, e0, v1,
   e1,..., ek-1, vk) is a closed H-trail if v0 = vk, and c(ek-1) and c(e0)
   are adjacent in H. A closed H-trail, T, is a closed Euler H-trail if
   E(T) = E(G). In order to see that H-coloring theory is related to the
   automata theory, let each vertex represents a state and each edge of H
   represents an allowed transition. This implies that an H-walk in a
   multigraph G is a predetermined sequence of allowed operations. Another
   interesting application goes as follows: a safe route conducted by a
   health inspector in a hospital (a route where the inspector does not
   carry bacteria from one area to another, in which can be deadly the
   spread such a bacteria) is given whenever the multigraph associated with
   the map of the hospital be an eulerian graph and it has a closed Euler
   H-trail for some well chosen H. Because of applications of Euler
   H-trails, it is natural to ask the following: (i) What structural
   properties of H imply the existence of Euler H-trails? (ii) What
   structural properties of G, with respect to the H-coloring, imply the
   existence of Euler H-trails? In this paper, we study Euler H-trails and
   we will show a characterization of the graphs containing an Euler
   Htrail. As a consequence of themain result we obtain a classical result
   proved by Kotzig (Matematicki. casopis 18(1): 76-80, 1968).},

Title = {Physical degradation and early diagenesis in foraminiferal tests after
   subaerial exposure in terrigenous-depleted beaches of Yucatan, Mexico},
Journal = {CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1175-1189},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Degradation, diagenesis, and mineralogical changes in foraminiferal
   tests are recognized as mechanisms that control their preservation and
   destruction under the subaquatic/aerial conditions, commonly influenced
   by processes such as dissolution, abrasion, breakage, and mineralogical
   replacement. In this paper, we discuss test degradation and early
   diagenesis on the large benthic foraminifera Archaias angulatus from the
   Yucatan Peninsula beach sands, a region absent in surficial rivers and
   terrigenous input seawards. Two main sites of Yucatan beach were
   selected: the high-energy environment of the Gulf of Mexico coast (GOMC)
   and the low-wave-energy environment of the Mexican Caribbean coast
   (MCC). Test degradation in the GOMC and MCC is affected by chemical
   dissolution, bioerosion, and physical abrasion. Among other factors, we
   found the effects of the bacterial microboring and dissolution by
   lowering pH in seawater (i.e., nearshore springs discharging seaward),
   as well as longshore currents and waves, depending on the prevailing
   conditions before transport and resuspension of the tests landwards. The
   observed degradation features in the tests are wall loss, chamberlet
   exposure, surface pits, and highly abraded edges. However, we explain
   the presence of pristine A. angulatus tests in the MCC beach through its
   association with Thalassia seagrass patches. Very low Mg/Ca ratios were
   found, which suggest the early diagenesis in the foraminiferal tests and
   the absence of recrystallized processes. Rare-earth element analyses
   suggest reduced authigenic precipitation of Mn-Fe coatings in the tests,
   and the absence of freshwater discharges or terrigenous inputs in the
   beach sands.},

Journal = {BIOMOLECULES},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, is a significant health
   threat in many countries and affects millions of people. Given the
   magnitude of this disease, a broader understanding of trypanocidal
   mechanisms is needed to prevent and treat infection. Natural
   endoperoxides, such as ergosterol peroxide, have been shown to be toxic
   to parasites without causing harm to human cells or tissues. Although
   prior studies have demonstrated the trypanocidal activity of ergosterol
   peroxide, the cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The
   results of this study indicate that a free-radical reaction occurs in T.
   cruzi following ergosterol peroxide exposure, leading to cell death.
   Using a combination of biochemical, microscopic and in silico
   experimental approaches, we have identified, for the first time, the
   cellular and molecular cytotoxic mechanism of an ergosterol peroxide
   obtained from Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq) P. Kumm. f. sp. Florida.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we develop the theory of stratifying systems in the
   context of exact categories as a generalisation of the notion of
   stratifying systems in module categories, which have been studied by
   different authors. We prove that attached to a stratifying system in an
   exact category (A, epsilon) there is an standardly stratified algebra B
   such that the category F-F(Theta), of F-filtered objects in the exact
   category (A, epsilon) is equivalent to the category F(Delta) of
   Delta-good modules associated to B. The theory we develop in exact
   categories, give us a way to produce standardly stratified algebras from
   module categories by just changing the exact structure on it. In this
   way, we can construct exact categories whose bounded derived category is
   equivalent to the bounded derived category of an standardly stratified
   algebra. Finally, applying the relative homological algebra developed by
   Auslander-Solberg, we can construct examples of stratifying systems that
   are not a stratifying system in the classical sense, so our approach
   really produces new stratifying systems.},

Abstract = {We present a stochastic model that mimics dengue transmission when two
   serotypes of the virus are circulating in a human population connected
   by a Watts-Strogatz complex network that reflects social interactions
   (human mobility). The influence of the number of connections per vertex
   and the network topology on the epidemics is analyzed. The first
   relation displays a sigmoid curve, while the second one shows that the
   increase in the network disorder facilitates disease spreading and
   serotype coexistence. The disease transmission thresholds for three
   network topology (regular, small-world and random) were obtained.
   Numerical results show that when coexistence of serotypes is a feasible
   outcome, negative correlation between the temporal evolution of the two
   serotype is more likely to occur. This could explain serotype dominance
   in consecutive epidemics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We study the cokernel of the application given by the Cartan matrix C of
   a finite dimensional k-algebra This produces a finitely generated
   abelian group, the Cartan group which is invariant under derived

   standardly stratified algebra, it is shown that this group is always
   finite and some interesting connections with the standard modules are
   found. As a consequence, it is got that G can be seen as a measure of
   how far is a standardly stratified algebra to be quasi-hereditary.
   Finally, it is also shown that any finite abelian group can be realized
   as the Cartan group of some standardly stratified algebra.},

Title = {The existence of a limit cycle in a pollinator-plant-herbivore
   mathematical model},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the existence of a limit cycle in a nonlinear ODE
   mathematical model which describes the interaction between three
   homogeneous populations. These take the form of pollinators, plants and
   herbivores. The interaction between the pollinators and plants is of
   mutualistic type given by a functional response of type II; meanwhile
   that for the plants-herbivores, from the demographic point of view, it
   can be seen as a predator-prey interaction. The resulting coupled
   nonlinear ODE system contains several parameters which have an important
   ecological interpretation. In the study we present here we give
   necessary conditions on the parameter values for the emergence of an
   attracting limit cycle and other which is unstable. These come from a
   supercritical and a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, respectively. Because
   of the amount of the involved parameters, almost any calculation becomes
   really massive. Thus, part of the analysis we present here intensively
   uses the Mathematica symbolic software. With the same software, by using
   a theorem authored by Kuznetsov, we calculated the first Lyapunov
   coefficient whose sign gives us the type of stability the limit cycle
   has. A number of numerical simulations also are included with the aim of
   showing the limit cycle in the three dimensional phase space. This is
   done in two main cases: when the ODE system has one positive equilibrium
   and when such system has two positive equilibria. The main part of the
   paper ends by exploring other set of parameters values which allows us
   to recover the previous dynamics but also gives us other interesting
   behaviors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Organometallic complexes of carbon nanotori},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {New organometallic complexes of carbon nanotori were designed and
   theoretically described by means of density functional theory. After a
   systematic structural search, it was found that energetically favorable
   complexes were formed by the metal atoms Cr and Ni, both located at the
   center of a nanotorus with diameter around 5 angstrom and 120 carbon
   atoms. The nature of the metal-nanotorus interaction shows a partial
   polar-covalent character, different from those found in other well-known
   organometallic compounds. Interactions were studied through molecular
   orbitals and thermodynamic stability. Ten bonds are set up between the
   metal atom and nanotorus, confirmed by electron density topology
   analysis, showing ten bond critical points among the metal atoms and the
   surrounding carbon atoms. The response of the induced electron current
   caused by a magnetic field perpendicular to the nanotorus was analyzed
   to explain the electron delocalization and aromaticity of the complexes.
   Only in the case of the chromium complex, the electron density is fully
   delocalized on the whole complex. According to a geometry-based index of
   aromaticity, interaction with the metal atom only changes the aromatic
   character of the carbon rings slightly. Also, induced currents were used
   to elucidate the presence of a ferrotoroidal behavior. The isolated
   nanotorus and its compound with a single Ni atom have well-defined
   ferrotoroidal behavior because they present broken symmetries and could
   help to design a topological insulator. Meanwhile, the nanotorus with a
   Cr atom at the center lacks ferrotoroidal behavior as a consequence of
   the absence of magnetic vortices.

Abstract = {Eugregarines are understudied apicomplexan parasites of invertebrates
   inhabiting marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Most
   currently known terrestrial eugregarines have been described
   parasitizing the gut from less than 1\% of total insect diversity, with
   a high likelihood that the remaining insect species are infected.
   Eugregarine diversity in orthopterans (grasshoppers, locusts, katydids,
   and crickets) is still little known. We carried out a survey of the
   eugregarines parasitizing the Mexican lubber grasshopper, Taeniopoda
   centurio, an endemic species to the northwest of Mexico. We described
   two new eugregarine species from the gut of the host: Amoebogregarina
   taeniopoda n. sp. and Quadruspinospora mexicana n. sp. Both species are
   morphologically dissimilar in their life-cycle stages. Our SSU rDNA
   phylogenetic analysis showed that both species are phylogenetically
   distant to each other, even though they parasitize the same host.
   Amoebogregarina taeniopoda n. sp. clustered within the clade
   Gregarinoidea, being closely related to Amoebogregarina nigra from the
   grasshopper Melanoplus differentialis. Quadruspinospora mexicana n. sp.
   clustered within the clade Actinocephaloidea and grouped with
   Prismatospora evansi, a parasite from dragonfly naiads. Amoebogregarina
   taeniopoda n. sp. and Q. mexicana n. sp. represent the first record of
   eugregarines found to infect a species of the family Romaleidae.},

Title = {Fluctuation-independent niche differentiation and relative non-linearity
   drive coexistence in a species-rich grassland},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Despite the advances in ecological theory, evidence for the relative
   importance of the different mechanisms that promote species coexistence
   is lacking. Some mechanisms depend on the presence of interannual
   fluctuations in the environment combined with interspecific differences
   in the responses to such fluctuations. Among coexistence mechanisms,
   niche differentiation and storage effects have received much attention,
   whereas relative non-linearity (RNL) has been thought to be an unlikely
   and weak mechanism for multi-species coexistence and remains untested in
   nature. We quantified the relative contribution of different mechanisms
   to the coexistence of 19 grassland species by using field-parameterized
   population models and invasion analysis. Our results showed that 17 out
   of 19 species had the potential to coexist stably. Species diversity was
   maintained by RNL and large fluctuation-independent niche differences,
   i.e., between-species differentiation that is unrelated to interannual
   variations in environmental factors. Moreover, RNL increased the fitness
   of species that were less favored by niche differentiation, contributing
   to their persistence in the community. Storage effect was negligible or
   destabilizing, making no contribution to stable coexistence. These
   results, altogether with recent theoretical developments and indirect
   evidence in published data, call for a reassessment of RNL as a relevant
   mechanism for multi-species coexistence in nature.},

Abstract = {A new species of nematode, Ascarophis morronei n. sp. (Cystidicolidae),
   is described from the stomach wall of the woolly sculpin Clinocottus
   analis (Cottidae) collected in the rocky intertidal from northwestern
   Baja California, Mexico. Collected nematodes were studied using both
   light and scanning electron microscopy. Sequence fragments for 18S rDNA
   molecular markers were obtained from the new nematode species, in order
   to test its position within the family Cystidicolidae under a
   phylogenetic context. Main characters distinguishing this new species
   include the reduced labia and the morphology of the eggs, distances of
   nerve ring and excretory pore from the anterior end, and left spicule of
   males. The new species described here is the second for the genus
   Ascarophis reported as adult in the Southern California Bight, and the
   first one recorded for the fish genus Clinocottus.},

Title = {HELMINTH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE GRAY FOUR-EYED OPOSSUM PHILANDER
   OPOSSUM (MAMMALIA: DIDELPHIDAE) IN THE NEOTROPICAL PORTION OF MEXICO},

Abstract = {Studies on helminth communities associated with didelphids are scarce;
   the majority of works have focused at taxonomic level. To increase the
   ecological knowledge of these host-parasite associations, during March
   (dry season) of 3 consecutive years (2013-2015) a total of 49 adults of
   the gray four-eyed opossum (Philander opossum) was collected in the
   Neotropical portion of Mexico (Agua Fria, Chiapas State) and examined
   for helminths. The main objectives of this study were to describe the
   infra- and component communities of helminths associated with P. opossum
   and to compare the helminth fauna of the Mexican population of this host
   species with those studied in French Guiana and in other Mexican
   terrestrial didelphids. The helminthological record of this host
   consisted of 12 species: 7 taxa of Nematoda, 3 of Trematoda, 1 Cestoda,
   and 1 Acanthocephala. Eight of the 12 taxa have been previously recorded
   in Didelphidae and 4 represent accidental infections (Glossocercus sp.,
   Stomylotrema vicarium, Spirura mexicana and Acanthocephala gen. sp.).
   Diet of hosts is the main structuring factor of the communities (92\% of
   the helminth species were recruited through ingestion). Forty-eight
   hosts were parasitized by at least 1 helminth species; Rhopalias
   coronatus was the most prevalent and abundant species in the hosts
   sampled. No significant differences were found in global prevalence
   among the helminth species present in all samplings, considering host
   sex and year. The dominance exerted by R. coronatus led to low values of
   evenness and diversity at both community levels. No significant
   differences were observed in composition of helminth species among the 3
   sampling years regarding sex. The results of our study showed changes in
   helminth abundance at infracommunity level; during the first sampling
   these changes are explained by species with direct life cycle (Viannaia
   sp. and Cruzia tentaculata), whereas in last 2 surveys the explanation
   can be attributed to species with heteroxenous life cycles (particularly
   R. coronatus, Duboisiella proloba, and Turgida turgida). Thirty-three
   percent of the helminth species recorded in P. opossum in Agua Fria is
   shared with the other 2 terrestrial species of didelphids sampled in
   different sites of Mexico: Didelphis marsupialis and Didelphis
   virginiana. In contrast, samples from French Guiana and Agua Fria,
   differ in terms of helminth fauna, confirming that the helminth
   communities of opossum species inhabiting the same locality show higher
   levels of taxonomic similarity than communities of conspecific
   marsupials allopatrically distributed.},

Abstract = {A new species of Rhopalias Stiles \& Hassall, 1898 is described from the
   small intestine of the Common opossum, Didelphis marsupialis Linnaeus
   from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Rhopalias oochi sp. nov. is
   morphologically very similar to the type species of the genus, Rhopalias
   coronatus (Rudolphi, 1819) Stiles \& Hassall 1898, a species widely
   distributed in opossums across Mexico. A molecular phylogenetic analysis
   using a mitochondrial gene (cox1), and the nuclear ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), of specimens of R. coronatus
   collected in several localities of Mexico revealed that those from the
   Yucatan Peninsula, originally recorded on morphological grounds as R.
   coronatus actually represented an independent genetic lineage. Maximum
   Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses were performed for each data
   set independently, and for the concatenated data set (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 +
   cox1). All phylogenetic analyses showed that the specimens from Yucatan
   represented a monophyletic lineage, with high bootstrap support and
   Bayesian posterior probabilities. In addition, the genetic divergence
   estimated between R. oochi sp. nov. and two species of Rhopalias, R.
   coronatus, and R. macracanthus Chandler, 1932 that also occur in Mexican
   marsupials ranged between 7-8\% and 16-17\%, for cox1, and between
   0.1-0.2\% and 7\% for the ITS region, respectively. The molecular
   evidence gathered in this study (reciprocal monophyly in both
   phylogenetic analyses, and estimated genetic divergence) suggested that
   the specimens found in the intestine of D. marsupialis originally
   reported as R. coronatus from Yucatan, actually represent a new species.
   Morphological evidence was found through light and scanning electron
   microscopy to support the species distinction based on molecular data.},

Abstract = {Let X = Pi(i) (is an element of I) X-i be a product of non-compact
   spaces. We show that if vertical bar I vertical bar > omega, then the
   remainder Y = bX\textbackslash{}X is pseudocompact, for any
   compactification bX of X. In fact, this theorem follows from a more
   general result about spaces with an omega-directed lattice of d-open
   mappings. Under the additional assumption that the space X has countable
   cellularity, we prove that the remainder Y is C-embedded in bX and that
   beta Y = bX. We apply these results to the remainders of topological
   groups and spaces of continuous functions with the pointwise convergence
   topology. For example, we prove that if X is an uncountable space and G
   is a non-compact topological group, then every remainder of C-p(X, G) is
   pseudocompact provided C-p (X, G) is dense in G(X). (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {We studied a 13-meter sediment core collected from La Mancha coastal
   lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico, to determine paleoenvironmental variations
   linked to the mid- to late Holocene sea-level rise. We examined modern
   and fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages, isotopic values in tests
   of Ammonia tepida (delta O-18-foram and delta C-13-foram), delta C-13 in
   organic matter (delta C-13-org), and sediment elemental ratios (Fe/Ca,
   Ca/Ti, and K/Rb) to reconstruct salinity variations, coastal processes,
   and the morphologic evolution of a partially closed coastal lagoon. We
   identified four main periods of environmental change: (1) From similar
   to 7800 to 6500 cal. yr. BP, the core site was an open lagoon with
   higher oceanic influence than today, through the presence of a southern
   mouth, as evidenced by the euryhaline assemblage
   Ammonia-Quinqueloculina-Bolivina-Nonionella. Low delta O-18-foram and
   high delta C-13 values on foraminifera shells indicate greater inputs of
   seawater, and delta C-13-org values reflect a lagoon environment.
   Elemental ratios of lower Fe/Ca, moderate Ca/Ti, and higher K/Rb suggest
   increased coastal weathering and reduced detrital deposits than today.
   (2) From similar to 6500 to 4600 cal. yr. BP., the lagoon experienced
   the progressive closure of the southern mouth, to the point that
   sedimentation restricted seawater entrance, as evidenced by variable
   delta C-13-org values, a lowering trend in delta O-18-foram and delta
   C-13-foram values, low Fe/Ca, higher Ca/Ti but moderate K/Rb values. At
   this time, benthic foraminifera were dominated by the opportunistic
   Ammonia-Elphidium polyhaline assemblage. (3) From similar to 4600 to
   1400 cal. yr. BP, the northern mouth was the only source of seawater to
   the lagoon, establishing the optimal environment for calcareous
   foraminifera of the polyhaline assemblage Ammonia-Elphidium. Lowest
   delta C-13-org values indicate greater organic input by terrestrial
   plants. (4) At 1400 cal. yr. BP, modern conditions of a partially closed
   lagoon were established, while increased terrigenous inputs and
   freshwater runoff favored the growth of agglutinated foraminifera
   species. At millennial time scales, in addition to the sea level rise
   effects, the lagoon evolution fits in the paleoclimatic context that
   links insolation, the latitudinal change of ITCZ, ocean currents,
   longshore drift and moisture transport, as driving factors of
   morphological change in the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico.},

Title = {Composition, richness and taxonomic diversity of Polychaete assemblages
   from La Paz Bay and adjacent oceanic areas of the Southern Gulf of
   California},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {In the present study, the composition and structure of the assemblages
   of polychaetes of La Paz Bay and adjacent oceanic areas of the Gulf of
   California was analyzed. A total of 56 species belonging to 39 genera
   and 22 families were collected from eight stations sampled during the
   spring of 2006 at 31 to 208 m depth. Onuphidae (14 species), Paraonidae
   (7 species) and Spionidae (6 species) were the best represented
   families. The highest number of species and individuals (mean= 13
   species station(-1); 76.7 ind. 0.1 m(-2)) was found in stations located
   in the Gulf shelf while inside of La Paz Bay, the fauna was less
   abundant and diverse (mean= 9 species station(-1); 47.0 ind. 0.1 m(-2)).
   Differences in species composition defined two main faunal groups, which
   were linked by their spatial distribution: assemblage Aricidea (Acmira)
   simplex - Aglaophamus verrilli inside the Bay, and assemblage
   Paraexogone molesta - Cirrophorus furcatus - Prionospio dubia in the
   Gulf shelf. The composition and structure of the fauna was mainly
   associated with the sediment type (Rho= 0.48; p = 0.06): muddy habitats
   inside the bay and sandy bottoms in the Gulf. Only 11 out of the 39
   identified genera (28.2\%) had more than two species, and only seven of
   the 23 families (30.4\%) had two or more species. This taxonomic
   heterogeneity caused a wide variability in the ``average taxonomic
   distance'' of every pair of individuals at each station (64.69 to
   89.58). Therefore, the distribution patterns of the taxonomic diversity
   values between the sites inside La Paz Bay (mean= 79.45) and those found
   outside, in the Gulf (mean= 79.77), were similar. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Both matrotrophy, the maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing
   embryos after fertilization, and superfetation, the simultaneous
   presence of two or more groups of embryos at different stages of
   development, occur at varying degrees among species of the fish family
   Poeciliidae. However, it is still unclear if these two reproductive
   modes depend on the presence of relatively complex placentas. We
   describe the ultrastructure of the maternal follicular placenta of 11
   poeciliid fishes using electron microscopy. In addition, we quantified
   six ultrastructure characteristics that reflect the degree of complexity
   (number of vesicles, area of vesicles, number of microvilli, microvilli
   length, thickness of the maternal follicle and follicular area). Using
   phylogenetic comparative methods, we evaluated the relationship between
   degree of matrotrophy and placental characteristics. We also analysed
   the potential effect of the presence of superfetation on placental
   complexity. We found a positive relationship between the degree of
   matrotrophy and follicular area, number of microvilli and number and
   area of vesicles. Similarly, follicular area and number of microvilli
   were larger in species with superfetation than in those without
   superfetation. We conclude that high degrees of matrotrophy and
   superfetation are associated with placental characteristics that
   increase the efficiency of nutrient transfer between mother and embryos.},

Abstract = {Land use changes are threatening the maintenance of biodiversity.
   Genetic diversity is one of the main indicators of biological diversity
   and is highly important as it shapes the capability of populations to
   respond to environmental changes. We studied eleven populations of
   Pseudoeurycea robertsi, a micro-endemic and critically endangered
   species from the Nevado de Toluca Volcano, a mountain that is part of
   the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Mexico. We sequenced the mitochondrial
   cytochrome b gene from 71 individuals and genotyped 9 microsatellites
   from 150 individuals. Our results based on the cytochrome b showed two
   divergent lineages, with moderate levels of genetic diversity and a
   recently historical demographic expansion. Microsatellite-based results
   indicated low levels of heterozygosity for all populations and few
   alleles per locus, as compared with other mole salamander species. We
   identified two genetically differentiated subpopulations with a
   significant level of genetic structure. These results provide
   fundamental data for the development of management plans and
   conservation efforts for this critically endangered species.},

Abstract = {All solid phases of bismuth under pressure, but one, have been
   experimentally found to superconduct. From Bi-I to Bi-V, avoiding Bi-IV,
   they become superconductors and perhaps Bi-IV may also become
   superconductive. To investigate the influence of the electronic
   properties N(E) and the vibrational properties F(omega) on their
   superconductivity we have ab initio calculated them for the
   corresponding experimental crystalline structures, and using a BCS
   approach have been able to determine their critical temperatures T-c
   obtaining results close to experiment: For Bi-I (The Wyckoff Phase) we
   predicted a transition temperature of less than 1.3 mK and a year later
   a T-c of 0.5 mK was measured; for Bi-II T-c is 3.9 K measured and 3.6 K
   calculated; Bi-III has a measured T-c of 7 K and 6.5 K calculated for
   the structure reported by Chen et al., and for Bi-V T-c similar to 8 K
   measured and 6.8 K calculated. Bi-IV has not been found to be a
   superconductor, but we have recently predicted a T-c of 4.25 K.},

Abstract = {We study the adsorption of ethene-1,2-dione or ethylene-dione (OCCO) on
   defective graphene sheets with nitrogen. The principal motivation is to
   determine the feasibility of the OCCO molecule as an intermediate state
   in the transformation of CO2 into hydrocarbons. We observed that
   defective graphene systems present weak interactions with the adsorption
   of OCCO molecules, in the physisorption range. The most stable
   configuration is the pyridinic-N-OCCO system, which presents p-type
   doping, donating electrons to the adsorbed molecules. Also, this system
   has the best electronic transport, inducing substantially free states in
   the Fermi-energy level and the virtual zone of the local density of
   states, while increasing the reactivity of the system. The increment of
   available states in the Fermi-energy level and thermic stability at room
   temperature makes the pyridinic-N system an excellent candidate to
   stabilize the OCCO molecule.},

Title = {Bioclimatic characterization of the world areas of Endemism identified

Abstract = {Areas of endemism (AoE) are identified by the congruence of two or more
   geographic distribution areas. They represent patterns of distribution
   resulting from ecological and evolutionary processes and constitute the
   basic units of biogeographic regionalization; however, they are not
   usually environmentally characterized. The 54 world areas of endemism
   identified for terrestrial mammals were bioclimatically characterized by
   climate and biome type, using two diversity indices. The climatic
   characterization shows that tropical climates, mainly Aw (equatorial
   savannah with dry winter) and Af (equatorial rainforest, fully humid)
   were the most frequent; included in 32 areas of endemism. The most
   frequent biomes were the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf
   forests, which grow at low altitudes. Most of the endemic taxa are
   located in lowlands, frequently from 0 to 1,000 m of altitude. Our
   results suggest that AoE are concentrated in tropical latitudes;
   however, we did not find any correlation between the homogeneity of the
   climate or the biome and the number of endemic taxa within each AoE.
   Therefore, we suggest that these AoE could have been mainly shaped by
   tectonic events, combined with environmental influence.},

Title = {Areas of endemism of the Neotropical species of Capparaceae},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Number = {3},
Pages = {507-520},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Neotropical seasonally dry forest (NSDF) has climatic constraints that
   have produced endemic species confined to floristic nuclei throughout
   those taxa with distribution restricted to this forest. Capparaceae have
   a pantropical distribution, although traditionally they have been
   considered mainly to be distributed in dry areas and therefore
   influenced by climatic constraints. We carried out an analysis of
   endemicity (NDM/VNDM) using 7602 records of 21 genera and 104 species in
   order to test whether climatic constraints of NSDF have shaped endemic
   species and areas of endemism of Capparaceae geographically confined to
   NSDF floristic nuclei. A total of three genera (monogeneric) and 29
   endemic species included in 38 areas of endemism and 14 consensus areas
   were recovered. From Consensus areas, we proposed five generalized areas
   of endemism, mainly located in NSDF: Lower Central America, Northern
   South America, Northwestern South America, Northeastern South America
   and Central South of South America. However, only one of them (Lower
   Central America, located in Panama) is not related to NSDF. These
   outcomes allow us to suggest that the distributional patterns of
   Capparaceae, represented by the areas of endemism, were mainly affected
   by the tectonics and climatic fluctuations that shaped the current
   distribution of NSDF.},

   M12L24 Nanoball (M=Pd+2, Cr, or Mo)},

Abstract = {We use molecular mechanics and DFT calculations to analyze the
   particular electronic behavior of a giant nanoball. This nanoball is a
   self-assembled M12L24 nanoball; with M equal to Pd+2; Cr; and Mo. These
   systems present an extraordinarily large cavity; similar to biological
   giant hollow structures. Consequently, it is possible to use these
   nanoballs to trap smaller species that may also become activated.
   Molecular orbitals, molecular hardness, and Molecular Electrostatic
   Potential enable us to define their potential chemical properties. Their
   hardness conveys that the Mo system is less reactive than the Cr system.
   Eigenvalues indicate that electron transfer from the system with Cr to
   other molecules is more favorable than from the system with Mo.
   Molecular Electrostatic Potential can be either positive or negative.
   This means that good electron donor molecules have a high possibility of
   reacting with positive regions of the nanoball. Each of these nanoballs
   can trap 12 molecules, such as CO. The nanoball that we are studying has
   large pores and presents electronic properties that make it an apposite
   target of study.},

Abstract = {Using the methodology developed by the Mexican National Disaster
   Prevention Centre (CENAPRED), we assessed the housing's structural risk
   to earthquakes and floods of the town of Motozintla, Chiapas, Mexico.
   Structural vulnerability was estimated by characterizing the local
   housing's construction and by randomly and statistically selecting the
   surveyed houses. We assessed risk by superposing the vulnerability
   geographical information system (GIS) layer over the seismic
   microzonation and flood scenarios GIS layers previously generated for
   Motozintla. Our results indicate that in general, this community has
   high structural vulnerability and risk levels to the two analyzed
   natural hazards. Very high seismic structural vulnerability is
   concentrated mainly along the northeastern and western sides of the
   local Xelaju Grande River. Another major finding is that in the worst
   flood case scenario (precipitation of 528mm/h with flood depth>125cm)
   more than 44\% of the houses in Motozintla will be severely damaged.
   Risk increases due to the prevalent precarious housing conditions. The
   results of this research will allow local authorities to strength their
   civil protection plans.},

Abstract = {Zanthoxylum limoncello is a native plant from southern Mexico which is
   used as a timber source, condiment and as a traditional medicine.
   Herein, we report on the volatile content of the leaf essential oil and
   its biological activities. The annual essential oils (2015-2018)
   contained volatile organic compounds which exhibited a moderate growth
   inhibitory activity against H. pylori ATCC 53504 (MIC 121.4-139.7 mu g
   mL(-1)), 26695 (MIC 85.5-94.9 mu g mL(-1)) and J99 (MIC 94.7-110.4 mu g
   mL(-1)). These hydrodistillates contained 2-undecanone (31.6-36.8 \%;
   MIC 185.3-199.2 mu g mL(-1)) and 2-undecenal (25.1-35.7 \%; MIC
   144.8-111.3 mu g mL(-1)) as the most abundant compounds which were
   partially involved in the anti-H. pylori activity. The human ornithine
   decarboxylase enzyme (ODC1), which shows increased activity in several
   cancer types, was non-competitively inhibited (V-max 2.7>0.8 K-cat
   s(-1)) by the essential oil of Z. limoncello as well as by 2-undecanone
   and 2-undecenal in accordance to in vitro kinetic studies. In silico
   calculations strongly suggest that the carbonyl group of these
   oxygenated hydrocarbons interacts with both Asn319 and Ala39 at the
   subunit A of ODC1. Considering that Ala39 is located close to Asn44, a
   crucial amino acid of the ODC's allosteric site, the non-competitive
   inhibition of the enzyme by 2-undecanone and 2-undecenal is endorsed.
   Finally, the essential oil of Z. limoncello and its main volatiles
   showed a significant (p<0.01) and prolonged repellent effect against
   Aedes aegypti.},

Title = {This town ain't big enough for both of us. . .or is it? Spatial
   co-occurrence between exotic and native species in an urban reserve},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Exotic species pose a threat to most ecosystems because of their
   potential to establish negative interactions with native biota. However,
   exotic species can also offer resources to native species, especially
   within highly modified environments such as urban ecosystems. We studied
   17 exotic-native pairs of species with the potential to compete with one
   another, or in which one of the species could offer resources to the
   other, in an urban ecological reserve located within Mexico City. We
   used two-species occupancy models to analyze the potential association
   between the presence of the exotic species and the spatial distribution
   of the native species, as well as to assess if these species tend to
   avoid each other (negative spatial interaction) or to co-occur more
   often than expected under the hypothesis of independent occurrences
   (positive spatial interaction). Our results revealed few cases in which
   the exotic species influenced occupancy of the native species, and these
   spatial interactions were mainly positive, indicated by the fact that
   the occupancy of the native species was usually higher when the exotic
   species was also present. Seven of the eight observed non-independent
   patterns of co-occurrence were evident during the dry months of the
   year, when resources become scarce for most species. Our results also
   demonstrate that the observed patterns of species co-occurrence depend
   on the distance to the nearest urban structure and the amount of herb,
   shrub, and tree cover, indicating that these habitat features influence
   whether native species avoid or co-occur with exotic species. Our study
   represents an important contribution to the understanding of temporal
   dynamics in the co-occurrence between exotic and native species within
   urban ecological reserves.},

Title = {A 14-ka Record of Dust Input and Phytoplankton Regime Changes in the
   Subtropical NE Pacific: Oceanic and Terrestrial Processes Linked by
   Teleconnections at Suborbital Scales},

Abstract = {We study shifts in phytoplankton proxies linked to terrigenous inputs
   and teleconnections in a core from Soledad Basin, Gulf of Ulloa, NW
   Mexico, spanning the end of the deglaciation and the Holocene. We used
   biogenic opal (\% opal), organic carbon (\% total organic carbon
   {[}TOC]), and inorganic carbon (\% CaCO3) as proxies of productivity and
   opal/TOC and CaCO3/TOC ratios as proxies of nutrient uptake and C-export
   by siliceous and carbonate organisms. We reconstructed terrestrial
   inputs and identified authigenic gypsum. Based on opal/TOC and CaCO3/TOC
   ratios, we found periodic changes of similar to 0.5, 1.1-1.8 ka cycle in
   phytoplankton proxies exporting siliceous and carbonate skeletal debris
   to the sediments. An increase in carbonate organisms occurred during
   14-8.7 ka, corresponding to reduced El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO)-like variability, in parallel to the northward displacement of
   the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and an overall negative phase
   of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). An increase in siliceous
   organisms occurred between 6 and 3 ka, coincident with strong ENSO-like
   conditions, southern migration of ITCZ, and less intense but more
   frequent positive PDO-hydrological variability. Grain size analyses show
   significant amounts of fine fraction (dust <6.6 mu m) present during the
   early- to mid-Holocene in agreement to extreme weather on land, with
   episodes of eolian and fluvial transport to the sea. The ENSO-like
   variations influenced biological C-export producers on a scale of
   1.1-1.8 ka, but PDO-related variability is uncertain. We suggest that
   Holocene drivers for phytoplankton successions are changes in
   insolation, ITCZ migration, California Current upwelling, nutrient
   inputs by advection, and terrestrial sources.
   Plain Language Summary We worked on a marine core off SW Baja
   California, Mexico, to study past changes in microscopic algal groups
   (phytoplankton) over the last 14,000 years. We study the role of
   nutrients from terrestrial and marine sources and investigate the role
   of ocean currents and natural phenomena like El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) along NE
   Pacific margin. To reconstruct biological productivity, we analyzed the
   remains of ancient organisms like silicon (opal), calcium carbonate
   (CaCO3), and organic matter (TOC) content and determine the algal group
   that grows more efficiently and deposits more organic matter in the
   sediments. To reconstruct terrestrial sources, we measure the sediments'
   grain size. We found cyclical periods that alternate siliceous versus
   carbonate algae every 500, 1,100, and 1800 years. Carbonate
   phytoplankton was more abundant between 14,000 and 8,000 years ago, and
   siliceous phytoplankton was more abundant between 6,000 and 3,000 years
   ago. Reconstructions of terrestrial climate suggest that during humid
   periods land nutrients and carbonate phytoplankton increase in parallel,
   whereas during the strength of the California Current, ocean nutrients
   and siliceous phytoplankton grow together, proving that an important
   connection exists between land climate, ocean circulation, and
   biological productivity.},

Abstract = {In this study we propose the use of experimental modules in order to
   favour meaningful learning. The modules are short experimental
   activities employing everyday materials. The study was done at UNAM's
   CCH-Oriente in Mexico City during a Physics IV class from February 28 to
   April 4, 2018. The learning was measured using a diagnostic assessment
   and two evaluation assessments. The written work of the modules was
   measured with a rubric. It was found that the use of the experimental
   modules indeed favour meaningful learning by the students, as the scores
   in the evaluation assessments were above the diagnostic and did not
   return to a base state 3 weeks after instruction. We verified that
   students were not answering the assessments randomly with a paired
   T-test, all except one of the pairs were below the 0.05 statistical
   significance. We sought a correlation between the written work in the
   modules and the answers in the assessments with a chi squared test but
   found none.},

Abstract = {This article presents a research breakthrough ``Advertising and obesity,
   regulation and selfregulation{''}, refers to the habits of consumption
   of foods of low nutritional value, exposure to media and advertising in
   Bachelor students of Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Results of
   two surveys of students are presented and contrasted with the studies of
   consumption of audiovisual media carried out by the Federal Institute of
   Telecommunications. In the past 40 years, obesity has become a health
   problem, the 36.3\% of adolescents and 72.5\% of adults are overweight
   or obese. Mexico ranks first place in childhood obesity, and second in
   the world in obesity in adults. Diet of Mexicans has become from the
   increase in the sale of processed foods and fast food, a central element
   of this is the intervention of advertising spread models and stereotypes
   that are associated with the consumption of products of low nutritional
   value, which has resulted in the formation of consumer habits from an
   early age in young Mexicans. Advertising operates together with the
   distribution of these products and their availability for purchase, has
   contributed to highlighting values such as success, immediacy, flavor,
   fun or fashion, which are presented as more important than the
   nutritional and form images and proposals for identification from the
   real and symbolic consumption. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy

Abstract = {The BIOBEAM GM2000 irradiation system was originally designed for blood
   irradiation (doses starting from 25Gy). In order to utilize this system
   for cell culture irradiation in pre-clinical research (doses from 0.5 to
   2.5Gy), a detailed description of the dose distribution at the
   aforementioned range is needed. The dosimetry was performed using
   TLD-100 in conjunction with EBT3 radiochromic film. Our main goal was to
   establish a set of irradiation parameters which ensure that the intended
   dose is delivered to the cell cultures. As a result of this work, a
   software tool was developed so as to automate the plan creation process.
   This will allow the use of this device for pre-clinical cell culture
   irradiation.},

Abstract = {The distribution and abundance of hippoid zoeal stages offshore
   Veracruz, southern Gulf of Mexico, and the migration routes of these
   larvae in the western Atlantic, were analysed. Samples were collected
   with a Bongo net and larval dispersal was analysed applying the HYCOM
   hydrodynamical model; particles (virtual larvae) originating from 35
   sites were tracked for 77 days. Larvae of Albunea paretii
   Guerin-Meneville, 1853 were the most abundant, and dispersal simulations
   indicated that older larvae occurring off Veracruz might originate from
   Texas. However, a substantial proportion of self-recruitment (7.8\%) can
   occur, mainly due to the seasonal changes in direction of currents over
   the shelf as well as the high variability in weather conditions. Results
   also suggest that several generations of A. paretii are needed for the
   species to reach Veracruz from South America. A hypothetical model
   regarding the migration routes of A. paretii larvae in the western
   Atlantic is proposed.},

Abstract = {Polar magnets are promising materials for applications such as
   multiferroics or in spintronics. In double-corundum-related oxides, the
   cation ordering imposes a polar structure and the use of high pressure
   facilitates the insertion of magnetic cations into the compounds. Here
   we present the high-pressure synthesis of a polar and ferrimagnetic
   corundum derivative of Mn2InSbO6, which adopts the ordered-ilmenite-type
   structure. Neutron powder diffraction reveals that the high-temperature
   nearly collinear ferrimagnetic phase evolves to an incommensurate
   helical structure with k(delta) = {[}0 0 k(z)] propagation vector, which
   then locks to the commensurate value of k(z) = 1/8. This complex
   magnetic behavior is likely to be related to magnetic frustration and
   the polar nature of the ordered double-corundum structure.},

Title = {Evidence for divergent patterns of local selection driving venom
   variation in Mojave Rattlesnakes (Crotalus scutulatus)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Snake venoms represent an enriched system for investigating the
   evolutionary processes that lead to complex and dynamic trophic
   adaptations. It has long been hypothesized that natural selection may
   drive geographic variation in venom composition, yet previous studies
   have lacked the population genetic context to examine these patterns. We
   leverage range-wide sampling of Mojave Rattlesnakes (Crotalus
   scutulatus) and use a combination of venom, morphological, phylogenetic,
   population genetic, and environmental data to characterize the striking
   dichotomy of neurotoxic (Type A) and hemorrhagic (Type B) venoms
   throughout the range of this species. We find that three of the four
   previously identified major lineages within C. scutulatus possess a
   combination of Type A, Type B, and a `mixed' Type A + B venom
   phenotypes, and that fixation of the two main venom phenotypes occurs on
   a more fine geographic scale than previously appreciated. We also find
   that Type A + B individuals occur in regions of inferred introgression,
   and that this mixed phenotype is comparatively rare. Our results support
   strong directional local selection leading to fixation of alternative
   venom phenotypes on a fine geographic scale, and are inconsistent with
   balancing selection to maintain both phenotypes within a single
   population. Our comparisons to biotic and abiotic factors further
   indicate that venom phenotype correlates with fang morphology and
   climatic variables. We hypothesize that links to fang morphology may be
   indicative of co-evolution of venom and other trophic adaptations, and
   that climatic variables may be linked to prey distributions and/or
   physiology, which in turn impose selection pressures on snake venoms.},

Abstract = {The present study deals with the detection of negative emotions in
   informal short texts (tweets). Our work takes advantage of several
   features of social networks, particularly their availability and
   confidence they offer users in terms of reflecting their emotions. The
   corpus of tweets was manually marked with emotions. The corpus was
   balanced because it had 3,000 tweets for each of Ekman's negative
   emotions and for neutral tweets (15,000 tweets in total). The objective
   of the present study was to apply automatic learning in two (sad versus
   neutral tweets) or five (tweets with emotions distinguished) categories.
   Different features were evaluated by changing types of elements (words
   or lemmas), sizes (uni-, bi-, tri-, unibi-, unibitrigrams, among
   others), and values (term frequency or term frequency-inverse document
   frequency). Sadness was detected with an F1=0.962. The F1 for all
   neutral tweets and those with negative emotions was relatively high
   (0.664) because the task itself was difficult (random baseline=0.2 for
   five categories). The present results were obtained from experiments
   conducted on the balanced textual corpus for the first time and were
   better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {We propose a global framework for the Earth system to facilitate
   communication between the geoscience community, the public and policy
   makers. Geoscience research aims to understand the history and evolution
   of the Earth system. This combines the non-living and living parts of
   the Earth, especially through interactions of the lithosphere, biosphere
   and atmosphere as well as the other parts of the system, such as the
   asthenosphere, core and extraterrestrial influences. Such research
   considers a system that spans scales from microscopic (micrometer scale)
   to megascopic (many 1000 s of km scale), and from milliseconds to
   millions of years. To connect different parts of this immense system, we
   habitually use a wide range of ad hoc geological frameworks, systems and
   geological environment models, where different processes and features
   operate and combine. In consequence, one way to judge the significance
   of our work, and to increase its value, is to assess how the elements
   studied are integrated within the whole Earth system. This allows us to
   see what implications any study has for this greater Earth system. To do
   this successfully, our research needs a standard global framework to
   assess a study's relevance. However, such a global framework does not
   formally exist, and so this article looks at existing examples and
   proposes one that can systematically place research into a global
   geological context. This proposed framework has the advantage of being
   useful for communicating geological processes to other disciplines, and
   can be used for any type of Earth (or planetary) environment. This
   framework is a fundamental tool for geoscience communication and for
   outreach, especially through geological heritage (geoheritage).
   Geoheritage concerns the valuing and protection of geoscience and
   geological sites, and is a vital tool for communicating geoscience. It
   can be used to communicate our knowledge of global change, providing,
   through landscapes and outcrops, a story that renders the concepts and
   advances of geoscience accessible. Like our basic research, the concept
   of geoheritage evolves as our understanding of the Earth progresses, and
   these dual changes can be explained with the global framework.
   Geoheritage is a global activity and it needs a global framework to put
   sites into context. A revision of the UNESCO geological thematic studies
   was called for by the World Heritage Committee in 2014 (decision: 38 COM
   8B.11), and this can be done with the input from the full geoscience
   community using this global geological framework.
   Thus, for research, geoscience policy and for geoheritage, a global
   framework is now needed. The proposed framework can place any site in
   its geological environment, related to its lithospheric plate tectonic
   setting and its history. The framework has a solid-earth bias
   (lithosphere), but includes all other spheres, such as the biosphere and
   its history. The framework has a solid-earth bias (lithosphere), but
   includes all other spheres, such as the biosphere and anthropogenic
   activity. Extraterrestrial influences, like solar variations and
   metorite impacts are included. The framework is phenomenological, due to
   the necessity of grouping the features that we see, but these phenomena
   provide evidence of processes that we cannot see. The basic format is a
   table, a sketch of the Earth and a system diagram, three complementary
   and most powerful ways of depicting a system. A timeline, or
   stratigraphic column can be included, to show the evolution of
   geological history, and the table can be used as a `game board' where
   one site migrates across from one set of conditions to another over
   time. The global framework allows any research site, area or subject to
   be set in the Earth's system, in a way that gives it context, allows
   comparisons and provides significance. We suggest that it can be a
   template for an internationally accepted version used to consolidate the
   necessary geoscience - geoheritage link and promote outreach.},

Abstract = {We present a record of millennial-scale paleoenvironmental variations
   from a site in Xochimilco basin, central Mexico, between 18000 and 5000
   years cal BP, using the magnetic mineralogy, geochemical elements
   content and diatom assemblages. The analyzed sedimentary sequence is
   chronologically constrained by the recognition of well-known tephra
   layers widely used as stratigraphical markers in the region: the Tutti
   Frutti Pumice from Popocatepetl stratovolcano (17070 years cal BP), and
   the Upper Toluca Pumice (12320 years cal BP) from the Nevado de Toluca,
   as well as a 14 C date from an ostracod rich horizon. The temporal
   variations recorded in magnetic susceptibility (y), Fe oxides and
   oxyhydroxides (hematite and goethite), ultra-fine magnetic minerals,
   titanium, organic and inorganic carbon, and the iron/titanium,
   calcium/titanium, organic carbon/nitrogen, silicon/titanium ratios and
   diatom content indicate fluctuations in runoff, origin of magnetic
   minerals, salinity, productivity and sources of organic matter. These
   variations respond to millennial-scale climatic oscillations. The
   deglacial period (18000-11700 years cal BP) was characterized by intense
   volcanic activity, and the dominance of clastic sedimentation in a fresh
   water shallow lake. The Heinrich I (cold), Bolling/Allerod (warm) and
   Younger Dryas (cold) events, were recorded in the runoff, organic matter
   content and carbonate precipitation proxies. The driest conditions in
   all of the sequence were recorded during early Holocene (11700-8200
   years cal BP). The return to more humid conditions and the establishing
   of a fresh water lake during the late mid Holocene (8200-5000 years cal
   BP), could promote the settling of communities on the lake shore.},

Abstract = {The present article describes the chemical composition and biological
   activities of the essential oils of B. glabrifolia leaves obtained in
   four consecutive years (2015-2018). The essential oils contained
   alpha-terpineol (17.9-29.7 \%), alpha-terpinene (12.6-17.4 \%), limonene
   (14.9-26.8 \%) and beta-pinene (2.1-16.7 \%) as the most abundant
   volatiles. The essential oils and these volatiles showed a significant
   adulticide activity (p<0.01; LC50 <100 mu g mL(-1)) on the maize weevil
   (Sitophilus zeamais) with a 100 \% mortality rate within a period of 5
   h. Also, the essential oils showed a strong antibacterial activity on
   Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (MIC, 132.7-173.6 mu g mL(-1)) and
   Helicobacter pylori ATCC 43504 (MIC, 74.8-199.2 mu g mL(-1)). The
   assessment of the main volatiles revealed alpha-terpineol as the
   principal antibacterial agent (MIC, 78.6-149.7 mu g mL(-1)). Similarly,
   the essential oils exhibited a substantial in vitro antiproliferative
   activity on the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 (LC50, 15.2-19.4
   mu g mL(-1)), the human ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 (LC50,
   27.3-53.7 mu g mL(-1)) and the myelogenous leukemia cell lines K-562
   (LC50, 32.4-75.9 mu g mL(-1)). alpha-Terpineol (LC50, 32.4-75.9 mu g
   mL(-1)) exhibited the strongest antiproliferative effect on these cancer
   cell lines (LC50, 22.4-48.1 mu g mL(-1)).},

Abstract = {More than 60 years ago, Geoffrey Harris described his ``neurohumoral
   theory,{''} in which the regulation of pituitary hormone secretion was a
   ``simple{''} hierarchal relationship, with the hypothalamus as the
   controller. In models based on this theory, the electrical activity of
   hypothalamic neurons determines the release of hypophysiotropic hormones
   into the portal circulation, and the pituitary simply responds with
   secretion of a pulse of hormone into the bloodstream. The development of
   methodologies allowing the monitoring of the activities of members of
   the hypothalamic-vascular-pituitary unit is increasingly allowing
   dissection of the mechanisms generating hypothalamic and pituitary
   pulses. These have revealed that whereas hypothalamic input is required,
   its role as a driver of pulsatile pituitary hormone secretion varies
   between pituitary axes. The organization of pituitary cells has a key
   role in the modification of their response to hypophysiotropic factors
   that can lead to a memory of previous demand and enhanced function.
   Feedback can lead to oscillatory hormone output that is independent of
   pulses of hypophysiotropic factors and instead, results from the
   temporal relationship between pituitary output and target organ
   response. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the generation of pulses
   cannot be generalized, and the circularity of feed forward and feedback
   interactions must be considered to understand both normal physiological
   function and pathology. We describe some examples of the clinical
   implications of recognizing the importance of the pituitary and target
   organs in pulse generation and suggest avenues for future research in
   both the short and long term.},

Abstract = {Embryo transfer using cryopreserved B.indicus embryos results in low
   pregnancy rates. The low viability of B.indicus embryos is likely a
   result of their low freezability relative to embryos from other species,
   notably B.taurus. Freezability is probably related to the quantity of
   lipid droplets in the embryonic cells. However, the mechanism underlying
   this association is unknown. Using multiphoton and transmission electron
   microscopy, the proportion, volume, morphology and composition of lipid
   droplets in fresh and cryopreserved B.indicus and B.taurus embryos were
   studied. B.indicus embryos have more droplets than B.taurus and a
   greater percentage of lipid droplets in clusters (34\% vs. 24\%;
   p<0.05). Also, B.indicus individual droplets are of greater volume than
   those of B.taurus (47m(3) vs. 34m(3); p<0.05). After freezing, the
   percentage of clusters decreased in B.indicus (11\% vs. 5\%; p<0.05),
   while in B.taurus they increased (2\% vs. 7\%; p<0.05). Freezing
   influenced the lipid droplet morphology, increasing the number of
   cracked droplets in B.indicus embryos (33\% fresh vs. 62\% frozen;
   p<0.05), but not in B.taurus embryos (35\% fresh vs. 34\% frozen; ns).
   Regarding composition, saturated lipid droplets prevail in B.indicus
   embryos, contrary to B.taurus embryos. We observed differences in lipid
   droplet organization, proportion, volume, morphology and composition
   between B.indicus and B.taurus embryos which are altered in opposite
   directions following freezing.},

Title = {Spatial variation in host preference in the endangered epiphytic

Year = {2018},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Although most vascular epiphytes are generalist, some exhibit host
   preferences. The latter may vary spatio-temporally driven by variation
   in environmental conditions. However, to our knowledge no previous
   studies have evaluated this variation. The aim of this study was to
   analyze variation in host preferences and population structures in the
   endangered bromeliad Tillandsia carlos-hankii in two pine-oak forests
   which differ in environmental conditions, tree composition and community
   structure. Our questions were: i) does Tillandsia carlos-hankii prefer
   certain host species over others?; ii) does this preference vary between
   sites?; iii) how does population structure vary between hosts species
   and sites? The two sites chosen were an east-facing (I-NE) and a
   west-facing slope (C-NW). The tree community was sampled within an area
   of 0.1 ha at each site. Preferred host species were identified using two
   criteria: a) the degree of colonization; and b) the probability of
   colonization. In addition, population size-structure on each colonized
   tree was evaluated to compare between sites and host species. The
   results showed that almost every tree in the community was colonized by
   this bromeliad. At both sites Quercus rugosa was a preferred host
   species, while Q. laurina and Mirsyne juergensenii were preferred at
   I-NE but limiting at C-NW. In turn, Pinus teocote was limiting at both
   sites. The percentage of small trees that were colonized depended on
   species identity. Population structures differed between sites and host
   species. Thus, both host preferences and local population behavior vary
   spatially given the differential conditions associated with the two
   sites.},

Abstract = {The Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus) inhabits deserts and arid
   grasslands of the western United States and Mexico. Despite considerable
   interest in its highly toxic venom and the recognition of two
   subspecies, no molecular studies have characterized range-wide genetic
   diversity and population structure or tested species limits within C.
   scutulatus. We used mitochondrial DNA and thousands of nuclear loci from
   double-digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing to infer
   population genetic structure throughout the range of C. scutulatus, and
   to evaluate divergence times and gene flow between populations. We find
   strong support for several divergent mitochondrial and nuclear clades of
   C. scutulatus, including splits coincident with two major
   phylogeographic barriers: the Continental Divide and the elevational
   increase associated with the Central Mexican Plateau. We apply Bayesian
   clustering, phylogenetic inference, and coalescent-based species
   delimitation to our nuclear genetic data to test hypotheses of
   population structure. We also performed demographic analyses to test
   hypotheses relating to population divergence and gene flow.
   Collectively, our results support the existence of four distinct
   lineages within C. scutulatus, and genetically defined populations do
   not correspond with currently recognized subspecies ranges. Finally, we
   use approximate Bayesian computation to test hypotheses of divergence
   among multiple rattlesnake species groups distributed across the
   Continental Divide, and find evidence for co-divergence at this boundary
   during the mid-Pleistocene.},

Title = {Geometrical focusing of surface waves},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {In this paper we investigate experimentally the waves produced by a
   parabolically shaped wave maker partially immersed into a water-filled
   basin and oscillating in the vertical direction. The main motivation of
   our study is to follow the analogy between light waves that focus on
   caustics, creating zones of intense light concentration, and surface
   waves in liquids Similarly to light focusing, the surface waves undergo
   spatial focusing leading to the growth of their amplitudes till they
   reach a cusp singularity. We detect three regimes. In the first one,
   which corresponds to small forcing amplitudes, the wave field agrees
   well with geometrical optics and with Pearcey diffraction theory near
   the caustics. In the second regime, weak nonlinearities are detected.
   However, waves still focus as predicted. In the third regime, at large
   forcing amplitude, a large-scale mean flow is generated. This flow is
   concentrated in two symmetric jets emerging from the wave maker front
   wall and producing two counter-rotating eddies because of the finite
   size of the basin. This large-scale flow modifies the shape of the wave
   fronts and leads to a displacement of the cusp towards the wave maker,
   modifying the analogy between light and surface waves.},

   present, a dark mark extending anteriorly from the lower temporal scales
   through the lower border of the orbit to the preocular or cantholoreal
   scales, keeled dorsal scales, dorsal body pattern usually composed of
   cross -bands mostly interrupted or barely discernible on middorsum,
   usually indiscernible vertical dark bars on the lateral fold (few, faint
   bars occasionally present), and black flecks scattered on the venter.
   The new species is geographically closest to G. lugr.fi and G.
   infernalis but morphologically most similar to CT infernalis.},

Abstract = {We describe four new fossil associations obtained from nine
   allochthonous blocks-the so-called Cipit boulders-on the basis of 23
   thin sections. The samples were collected from the well-known
   Middle-Late Triassic St. Cassian Formation (NE Italy). These
   associations were determined by considering all biomorpha and
   microbialitic structures that were quantified and analyzed by performing
   Q-mode cluster analysis of the thin sections. Three algorithms and two
   indices were used for analysis. Additional identified materials include
   cementation and microsparite fabrics, as well as allochthonous
   components. The studied communities include the following: the
   Ceratoporella breviacanthostyl-Tubiphytes Association, the Cryptocoelia
   zitteli-Mesophylum Association, the Cladogirvanella-stromatolite
   Association, and the Amblysiphonella strobiliformis-Megalodon
   Association. The origins of the paleoenvironmental settings of the
   communities presented here are proposed based mainly on their fossil
   diversity, considering that many fossils are indicators of specific
   palaeoenvironmental conditions.},

Title = {Marchantia liverworts as a proxy to plants' basal
   microbiomes},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Microbiomes influence plant establishment, development, nutrient
   acquisition, pathogen defense, and health. Plant microbiomes are shaped
   by interactions between the microbes and a selection process of host
   plants that distinguishes between pathogens, commensals, symbionts and
   transient bacteria. In this work, we explore the microbiomes through
   massive sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of microbiomes two Marchantia
   species of liverworts. We compared microbiomes from M. polymorpha and M.
   paleacea plants collected in the wild relative to their soils substrates
   and from plants grown in vitro that were established from gemmae
   obtained from the same populations of wild plants. Our experimental
   setup allowed identification of microbes found in both native and in
   vitro Marchantia species. The main OTUs (97\% identity) in Marchantia
   microbiomes were assigned to the following genera: Methylobacterium,
   Rhizobium, Paenibacillus, Lysobacter, Pirellula, Steroidobacter, and
   Bryobacter. The assigned genera correspond to bacteria capable of
   plant-growth promotion, complex exudate degradation, nitrogen fixation,
   methylotrophs, and disease-suppressive bacteria, all hosted in the
   relatively simple anatomy of the plant. Based on their long evolutionary
   history Marchantia is a promising model to study not only long-term
   relationships between plants and their microbes but also the
   transgenerational contribution of microbiomes to plant development and
   their response to environmental changes.},

Abstract = {The Maastrichtian crustacean fauna from Chiapas is illustrated and
   reviewed with reports of new taxa, including the marine isopod Palaega
   sp., described for the first time from the lower Maastrichtian
   Ocozocoautla Formation, represented by molted remains of the posterior
   carapace. New specimens and a neotype of the raninoid Vegaranina
   precocia (Feldmann et al., 1996) are illustrated and compared with
   specimens of Vegaranina sp. from the late Maastrichtian of France. New
   specimens of Carcineretes woolacotti Withers, 1922, from the late
   Maastrichtian of Chiapas are reported and recognized as the sole species
   of the genus, distributed in the upper Maastrichtian lithostratigraphic
   units from the Caribbean; the new specimens are compared with others of
   the same species and age from the Guinea Corn Formation in Jamaica and
   the Barton Creek Formation in Belize. Icriobranchiocarcinus tzutzu Vega
   new genus and species, is reported as a new member of the
   Icriocarcininae Stevcic, 2005, a diverse subfamily of lithophylacid
   crabs, along with illustrations and discussion on Branchiocarcinus
   flectus (Rathbun, 1926) (Maastrichtian, Gulf and Atlantic plains),
   Icriocarcinus xestos Bishop, 1988 (Maastrichtian, Pacific of California
   and Baja California), and Lithophylax trigeri A. Milne-Edwards and
   Brocchi, 1879 (Cenomanian, France), in order to confirm that all of
   these species belong to the Lithophylacidae Van Straelen, 1936, but to
   different subfamilies (Lithophylacinae and Icriocarcininae) and genera.
   Parazanthopsis meyapaquensis Vega, Feldmann, Garcia-Barrera, Filkorn,
   Pimentel \& Avendano, 2001, is compared with Palaeoxanthopsis cretacea
   (Rathbun, 1902) (late Maastrichtian, Brazil), and with Palaeoxantho
   libertiensis Bishop, 1986 (late Maastrichtian, Mississippi), in order to
   illustrate differences and confirm that these species belong to separate
   genera. Megaxantho zoque Vega, Feldmann, Garcia-Barrera, Filkorn,
   Pimentel \& Avendano, 2001 is reviewed and compared to MenOpe
   frescoensis Remy, 1960 (early Eocene, Senegal) and Menippe mercenaria
   (Say, 1818) (living species, Gulf of Mexico), to confirm the late
   Maastrichtian species from Chiapas should be recognized as Menippe zoque
   new combination, representing the oldest confirmed species for the
   genus. The age and lithostratigraphic units for all these Maastrichtian
   crustaceans from Chiapas is reviewed and corrected, based on recent data
   reported by other scientists, who defined the litho and biostratigraphy
   with macro and microfossils reported from the study area, nearby Tuxtla
   Gutierrez and Ocozocoautla, Chiapas. A correlation between the late
   Maastrichtian lithostratigraphic units of Chiapas and those from the
   Caribbean region is confirmed, and their distribution in turn of the
   Chicxulub impact area in the Yucatan Peninsula is illustrated.

Title = {Cementum protein 1 transfection does not lead to ultrastructural changes
   in nucleolar organization of human gingival fibroblasts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERIODONTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},
Pages = {636-642},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background and ObjectiveTransfection of cementum protein 1 (CEMP1) into
   human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) notably increases cell metabolism and
   results in overexpression of molecules related to biomineralization at
   transcriptional and protein levels. Therefore, HGF-CEMP1 cells are
   considered as putative cementoblasts. This represents a significant
   advance in periodontal research because cementum neoformation is a key
   event in periodontal regeneration. In addition, it is well known that
   important changes in cell metabolism and protein expression are related
   to nucleolar structure and the function of this organelle, which is
   implicated in ribosome biogenesis. The aim of this study was to
   determine the effect of transfecting CEMP1 gene in human HGF on the
   ultrastructure of the nucleolus.
   Material and MethodsCells were processed using the conventional
   technique for transmission electron microscopy, fixed with
   glutaraldehyde, postfixed with osmium tetraoxide, and embedded in epoxy
   resin. Semi-thin sections were stained with Toluidine blue and observed
   by light microscopy. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and
   lead citrate. For ribonucleoprotein detection, the staining method based
   on the regressive effect of EDTA was used. In addition, the osmium
   ammine technique was used for specific staining of DNA.
   ResultsThe results obtained in this study suggest that transfection of
   CEMP1 into HGFs does not produce changes in the general nucleolar
   ultrastructure because the different components of the organelle are
   present as fibrillary centers, and dense fibrillar and granular
   components compared with the control.
   ConclusionThe transfection of CEMP1 into HGFs allows these cells to
   perform cementoblast-like functions without alteration of the
   ultrastructure of the nucleolus, evaluated by the presence of the
   different compartments of this organelle involved in ribosomal
   biogenesis.},

Abstract = {Seven new species of the genus Chrysometa Simon are described: C.
   citlalteped n. sp., C. triangulosa n. sp., C. rosarium n. sp., C.
   atotonilco n. sp., C. xamaticpac n. sp. C. puya n. sp. and C. sagicuta
   n. sp. Species identities were evaluated and sexes for each species
   matched with a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. These
   data were analyzed with maximum likelihood and the resulting cladograms
   separated all species with high support values (95-100) and an average
   distance of 0.093 \%. The genetic signal also agreed with the diagnostic
   morphological features used to separate these taxa. The sex matching
   results discovered that the female of C. chipinque Levi actually belongs
   to C. puya n. sp.; the correct female of C. chipinque is here described
   for the first time. A redescription of the male of C. chipinque and the
   female of C. puya is also provided. All species were collected as part
   of a faunistic inventory from two oak forests near Pico de Orizaba
   Volcano National Park. A total of 399 adult specimens, 209 females and
   195 males, were sorted and identified. Most individuals were collected
   from medium height vegetation by beating trays and from high vegetation
   by direct collecting at night. High resolution images for all species
   are available at www.unamfcaracnolab.com . Finally, the functional
   anatomy of the epigynum for the species described here is discussed.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the volatile profile and pharmacological
   activities of the essential oil and resin from Bursera slechtendalii, an
   aromatic medicinal tree commercialized in southern Mexico. The essential
   oil contained 25 volatiles including p-cymen-8-ol (25.4-35.7\%), n-hexyl
   hexanoate (6.8-17.6\%) and n-octyl hexanoate (7.6-14.8\%), whereas the
   crystallized resin contained 14 volatiles, including n-octyl acetate
   (29.6-34.2\%), limonene (15.8-18.7\%) and n-octyl butyrate
   (12.6-17-6\%). The inhalation of vapors from the resin and essential oil
   caused a significant anxiolytic-like effect (p < .01) in ICR mice after
   20 min of exposure at a dose of 50-150 mg L-1. The prolonged inhalation
   of the essential oil (for 40 days, for 15 min, twice a day) produced a
   significant decrease (p < .01) in total cholesterol and LDL-c content as
   well as an increase of HDL-c levels in the same murine model.
   Interestingly, levels of hepatic lipid hydroperoxide decreased, whereas
   the hepatic activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase
   was significantly enhanced (P < .05). The detection of p-cymen-8-ol and
   n-octyl acetate in the plasma of mice strongly suggests their
   bioavailability and possible role in the biological activities described
   herein. Also, both the resin and essential oil from B. slechtendalii, as
   well as their main volatiles, showed a potent repellence activity
   against Aedes aegypti (p < .01).},

Title = {PM1 Chemical Characterization during the ACU15 Campaign, South of Mexico
   City},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ``Aerosoles en Ciudad Universitaria 2015{''} (ACU15) campaign was an
   intensive experiment measuring chemical and optical properties of
   aerosols in the winter of 2015, from 19 January to 19 March on a site in
   the south of Mexico City. The mass concentration and chemical
   composition of the non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1)
   was determined using an Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor
   (ACSM). The total NR-PM1 mass concentration measured was lower than
   reported in previous campaigns that took place north and east of the
   city. This difference might be explained by the natural variability of
   the atmospheric conditions, as well as the different sources impacting
   each site. However, the composition of the aerosol indicates that the
   aerosol is more aged (a larger fraction of the mass corresponds to
   sulfate and to low-volatility organic aerosol (LV-OOA)) in the south
   than the north and east areas; this is consistent with the location of
   the sources of PM and their precursors in the city, as well as the
   meteorological patterns usually observed in the metropolitan area.},

Title = {Possible superconductivity in the Bismuth IV solid phase under pressure},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {The first successful theory of superconductivity was the one proposed by
   Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in 1957. This breakthrough fostered a
   remarkable growth of the field that propitiated progress and
   questionings, generating alternative theories to explain specific
   phenomena. For example, it has been argued that Bismuth, being a
   semimetal with a low number of carriers, does not comply with the basic
   hypotheses underlying BCS and therefore a different approach should be
   considered. Nevertheless, in 2016 based on BCS we put forth a prediction
   that Bi at ambient pressure becomes a superconductor at 1.3 mK. A year
   later an experimental group corroborated that in fact Bi is a
   superconductor with a transition temperature of 0.53 mK, a result that
   eluded previous work. So, since Bi is superconductive in almost all the
   different structures and phases, the question is why Bi-IV has been
   elusive and has not been found yet to superconduct? Here we present a
   study of the electronic and vibrational properties of Bi-IV and infer
   its possible superconductivity using a BCS approach. We predict that if
   the Bi-IV phase structure were cooled down to liquid helium temperatures
   it would also superconduct at a T-c of 4.25 K.},

Abstract = {Emission factors and personal exposure measurements were obtained in the
   working environment of a brick kiln yard in the municipality of Victoria
   de Durango, Mexico. Two kinds of kiln were evaluated; one was a fixed
   traditional kiln (FTK); the other was a local variation of an improved
   kiln called the ecological Marquez brick kiln (MK2). To distinguish it
   from the original design, we call it the Marquez kiln Durango (MKD).
   Ambient emission gases of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO),
   methane (CH4), and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) were continuously
   followed using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR).
   Elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) ambient emissions were
   sampled on quartz filters and analyzed by chemical coulombimetry.
   Personal exposure to CO was continuously followed using portable
   monitors, and personal exposure to inhalable particles with diameters of
   generally 2.5 mu m and smaller (PM2.5) was obtained using Teflon filters
   in portable particle samplers followed by gravimetric analysis. Results
   show that the FTK emits more PM2.5, EC, and OC per cooking stage than
   the MKD. In terms of PM2.5 emission factors, relative to the FTK, the
   MK2 is 61\% smaller and the MKD emission factor is 39\% smaller. Against
   our expectations, the MKD showed higher work environment exposure
   levels. This is due to the untested changes to the original MK2 design
   and a mismanagement of the operation processes. Personal exposure to CO
   and PM2.5 of local brick kiln workers was about three times higher than
   indoor exposure from the use of three-stone wood cookstoves in Mexico.
   The analysis of emission plumes from FTK and MKD using a coupled
   emission model dispersion model allowed us to evaluate the impacts,
   transport, and deposition area of the particle matter in the area
   surrounding Durango Brickyard (DB).},

Abstract = {The southern Gulf of Mexico is typically a coastal plain where rocky
   shores are scattered distributed. The goal of this study was to compare
   the chiton community structure of the rocky shore of Montepio during the
   dry and `nortes' (stormy) weather periods, and to gather data on the
   relative growth of the dominant species. Sampling was carried out along
   a transect of 100 x 2 m in the intertidal zone and 83 individuals were
   collected. Six species were identified: Lepidochitona rosea,
   Chaetopleura apiculata, lschnochiton kaosi, Lepidochitona
   pseudoliozonis, Lepidochitona liozonis and Acanthochitona andersoni.
   Species richness (S= 4) and Shannon diversity (1.36 and 1.29 bits
   ind(-1) in dry and stormy seasons) were very similar between the 2
   seasons; however, only 2 species occurred in both periods, suggesting a
   strong seasonal exchange of species (50\%). This seasonal dynamics could
   be due to the discontinuity of the rocky substrate, which would not
   allow a rapid recovery of the populations after the impact of storms.
   Density of individuals was low (< 2.50 ind. 10 m(-2)) due to 2 factors:
   the diurnal tide, which induces the individuals to 12 h of air exposure,
   and the low salinity, due to the proximity of two rivers. The relative
   growth of the dominant species (L. rosea and C. apiculata) was isometric
   for the length vs. width relationship and negatively allometric for the
   length vs. height relationship. In the southern Gulf of Mexico, sites
   such as Montepio may function as marine oases for obligate inhabitants
   of hard substrates.},

Abstract = {Trace metal species in the water column of a canal system forming a
   wetland filled with wastewater were analyzed to determine their
   correlation with metal accumulation in the gills of locally fished
   Oreochromis niloticus. The metal concentrations in the suspended
   particles and water dissolved were analyzed. The metal species were
   calculated using Windermere Humic Aqueous Model version VII showing that
   the high organic matter and major cation contents were important
   parameters. Also, the free ion metal concentration was expected to
   correlate with the organic matter aromaticity; however, organic
   compounds other than humic susbtances seem to be complexing the metals
   in the system. Additionally, no clear correlation could be found between
   metal accumulation in gills and any of the dissolved metal species.
   Nonetheless, certain trends could be seen between the calculated metal
   species and metal accumulation in the tilapia from the suspended
   particles.},

Abstract = {Reproductive aspects of most snake species remain elusive because of
   secretive habits or rarity. Here, we report data on litters of Crotalus
   triseriatus from two populations in central Mexico. We made 4-d visits
   to both study sites every other week from April to June during 2014 and
   2015 (Site 1) and during 2015 (Site 2). Surveys were made from 0900 to
   1800 h to catch as many gravid females as possible. All adult females
   were maintained in captivity until parturition. We recorded a total of
   16 litters (10 from Site 1 and six from Site 2). Average litter size was
   7.2 +/- 2.2 (n = 13), higher than previously reported in the species. We
   found no relationship between maternal snout-vent length (SVL) and
   litter size, and litter size did not differ between study sites or
   years. In contrast with other studies, we found no relationship between
   neonate SVL, body mass, and litter size or between maternal and neonatal
   traits. Dusky Rattlesnakes demonstrate a plastic reproductive response
   to changing environmental conditions. Neonate body size varied between
   sites, indicating that local selection may act through predation
   pressure, prey availability, or other environmental variables. Local
   selection may lead to differences in life history traits, whereas annual
   variation in factors such as prey availability might influence
   reproductive traits. Our study highlights the need for long-term studies
   to understand the sources of variation in life history.},

Abstract = {Let D = (V(D), A(D)) be a digraph. A subset S subset of V(D) is
   k-independent if the distance between every pair of vertices of S is at
   least k, and it is l-absorbent if for every vertex u in V(D)
   \textbackslash{} S there exists v is an element of S such that the
   distance from u to v is less than or equal to l. A k-kernel is a
   k-independent and (k - 1)-absorbent set. A kernel is simply a 2-kernel.
   A classical result due to Duchet states that if every directed cycle in
   a digraph D has at least one symmetric arc, then D has a kernel. We
   propose a conjecture generalizing this result for k-kernels and prove it

Abstract = {The widely distributed, Central American anguid lizard Mesaspis
   moreletii is currently recognized as a polytypic species with five
   subspecies (M. m. fulvus, M. m. moreletii, M. m. rafaeli, M. m.
   salvadorensis, and M. m. temporalis). We reevaluated the species limits
   within Mesaspis moreletii using DNA sequences of one mitochondrial and
   three nuclear genes. The multi-locus data set included samples of all of
   the subspecies of M. moreletii, the other species of Mesaspis in Central
   America (M. cuchumatanus and M. monticola), and some populations
   assignable to M. moreletii but of uncertain subspecific identity from
   Honduras and Nicaragua. We first used a tree-based method for delimiting
   species based on mtDNA data to identify potential evolutionary
   independent lineages, and then analized the multilocus dataset with two
   species delimitation methods that use the multispecies coalescent model
   to evaluate different competing species delimitation models: the Bayes
   factors species delimitation method (BFD) implemented in {*}BEAST, and
   the Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BP\&P) method. Our
   results suggest that M. m. moreletii, M. m. rafaeli, M. m.
   salvadorensis, and M. m. temporalis represent distinct evolutionary
   independent lineages, and that the populations of uncertain status from
   Honduras and Nicaragua may represent additional undescribed species. Our
   results also suggest that M. m. fulvus is a synonym of M. m. moreletii.
   The biogeography of the Central American lineages of Mesaspis is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the idea that staggered-grid methods give a greater
   stability and give energy conservation, this article presents a new
   family of high-order implicit staggered-grid finite difference methods
   with any order of accuracy to approximate partial differential equations
   involving second-order derivatives. In particular, we numerically
   analyze our new methods for the solution of the one-dimensional acoustic
   wave equation. The implicit formulation is based on the plane wave
   theory and the Taylor series expansion and only involves the solution of
   tridiagonal matrix equations resulting in an attractive method with
   higher order of accuracy but nearly the same computation cost as those
   of explicit formulation. The order of accuracy of the proposal staggered
   formulas are similar to the methods with conventional grids for a (2M +
   2)-point operator: the explicit formula is (2M)th-order and the implicit
   formula is (2M +2) th-order; however, the results demonstrate that new
   staggered methods are superior in terms of stability properties to the
   classical methods in the context of solving wave equations.},

Title = {Traditional uses and seed chemical composition of Jatropha spp.

Abstract = {The Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve in Mexico holds genetic
   richness and endemism for the genus Jatropha, but the specific use of
   the plants and the seed chemical profiles are still unknown. We recorded
   the traditional forms of use of Jatropha species, and analyzed the
   chemical composition of Jatropha spp. seeds. For this, a semi-structured
   survey was conducted in 15 towns, and 20 interviews were applied in each
   one between May and August 2012 to estimate the Significant Use Level
   and Relative Use Value per species. Besides, seeds from J.
   neopauciflora, J. rufescens, and J. rzedowskii were collected between
   August and October 2013, and to seed flour samples we determined total
   lipids by the Soxhlet method, crude protein by the Kjendahl method, and
   ashes according to AOAC methods; fatty acid profile and phorbol esters
   were determined by gas chromatography and by HPLC, respectively. The
   species J. neopauciflora, J. oaxacana, J. rufescens, J. ciliata, and J.
   rzedowskii, are used as traditional medicine, food, and ornaments,
   except for J. ciliata, for which none use was recorded. The Significant
   Use Level as food was found not significant, but for medicinal purposes,
   J. neopauciflora obtained the highest Relative Use Value (9.0 \%). The
   latex is used to treat 13 disorders, including dental problems and oral
   diseases with a Significant Use Level of 32.9 \%; it is also used as a
   hemostatic. The protein content among species varied from 23.37 to 26.06
   \%, and total lipids from 34.79 to 36.60 \%. The principal unsaturated
   fatty acids were oleic (25.08 to 30.09 \%) and linoleic (44.55 to 48.46
   \%), and the saturated fatty acids were palmitic (10.11 to 16.50 \%) and
   stearic (9.47 to 11.15 \%). Phorbol esters, the main cause of seed's
   toxicity, were absent in J. neopauciflora, J. rufescens, and J.
   rzedowskii. In conclusion, the Significant Use Level of Jatropha species
   studied was low, with little cultural acceptance and sporadic
   utilization. The Relative Use Value was important for medicinal
   purposes, especially for J. neopauciflora. The dehulled seeds of J.
   neopauciflora, J. rufescens, and J. rzedowskii are potentially useful as
   food, having high protein contents, and unsaturated oleic and linoleic
   fatty acids. With this study we report three non-toxic Jatropha species
   and recommend to scientifically validate the antimycotic use of J.
   neopauciflora latex.},

Abstract = {A detailed description of a new stygobiont species of the amphipod
   family Hadziidae, Mayaweckelia troglomorpha Angyal, sp. n. is given,
   based on material collected in four cenotes of Yucatan federal state,

   electron microscopy. Morphological description is complemented with
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences as
   barcodes, with affinities to the related taxa and with notes on the
   species' ecology. Using COI Bayesian inference and genetic distance
   analyses, we show that the closest relative of the new species is M.
   cenoticola, forming a monophyletic group referring to the genus
   Mayaweckelia. Based on the available sequences, we also revealed that
   Mayaweckelia and Tuluweckelia are sister genera, standing close to the
   third Yucatan subterranean genus, Bahadzia. The data gathered on the
   habitat, distribution, abundance, and ecology will contribute to the
   conservation planning for M. troglomorpha Angyal, sp. n.},

Abstract = {Given compact spaces X and Y, if X is Eberlein compact and C-p,C-n (X)
   is homeomorphic to C-p,C-n (Y) for some natural n, then Y is also
   Eberlein compact; this result answers a question posed by Tkachuk.
   Assuming existence of a Souslin line, we give an example of a Corson
   compact space with a Lindelof subspace that fails to be Lindelof Sigma;
   this gives a consistent answer to another question of Tkachuk. We
   establish that every Sigma(s)-product of K-analytic spaces is Lindelof
   Sigma and Cp(X) is a Lindeltif Sigma-space for every Lindelof
   Sigma-space X contained in a Sigma(s)-product of real lines. We show
   that C-p(X) is Lindelof for each Lindelof Sigma-space X contained in a
   Sigma-product of real lines. We prove that Cp(X) has the Collins-Roscoe
   property for every dyadic compact space X and generalize a result of
   Tkachenko by showing, with a different method, that the inequality w(X)
   <= nw(X)(Nag(X)) holds for regular spaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Ectomycorrhizal pre-inoculation of Pinus hartwegii and Abies

   central Mexico},
Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {Few studies have focused on analyzing the effect of native inoculated
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal strains on seedlings under field conditions
   in temperate forests. However, it is crucial to verify that the positive
   effects of ECM under nursery conditions also occur in the field,
   favoring their performance. We evaluated the short-term effect of ECM on
   three-year-old seedlings of Pinus hartwegii and Abies religiosa in
   central Mexico by subjecting them to four treatments: inoculation with
   Inocybe splendens, inoculation with Suillus brevipes (both native
   strains), inoculation with forest soil, and non-inoculated plants.
   Percentage of ECM colonization, plant growth (shoot height and stem
   diameter), and physiological (osmotic potential, stomatal conductance,
   CO2 assimilation and water use efficiency) responses were evaluated. We
   found that these two ECM species were partial (P. hartwegii) or totally
   (A. religiosa) replaced after one and a half years in the field. P.
   hartwegii seedlings increased their water use efficiency during the dry
   season, but in A. religiosa seedlings, a clear strategy for avoiding
   water stress was not detected. This ECM replacement had a negative
   effect on the physiological performance Of A. religiosa. Our results
   emphasize the importance of selecting compatible fungal-host species
   combinations for nursery inoculation and of using sources of inoculum
   adapted to the environmental conditions of the transplant site, ensuring
   root colonization prior to field transplanting to minimize seedling
   mortality due to water stress.},

Abstract = {Biogeographical transition zones are areas of a complex biotic mixture
   located at the borders between biogeographical units. Climatic, physical
   and ecological factors should play an important role in allowing
   coexistence of different biotic elements in the transition zone. Here,
   we explore the relationship between environmental factors and
   biogeographical transition zones, defined by Neotropical mammal
   distributions, by a model selection approach based on the Akaike
   information criterion and accounting for the spatial structure in the
   data. We detected three areas of high overlap between mammalian areas of
   endemism. Two of them corresponded to the well-established
   regional-level transition zones, namely Mexican (MTZ) and South American
   (SATZ) transition zones; the third was one located in south-eastern
   Brazil, approximately between the Parana and Chacoan dominion that we
   call The Atlantic Forest integration zone (AF). Only one explicative
   variable was shared by the three transitions zones (precipitation of the
   warmest quarter). However, shared variables with great explanatory power
   indicated two environmental aspects as facilitators for the coexistence
   of different biotic components in a given geographical area. The first
   one was the heterogeneity component, either topographic for the SATZ and
   MTZ or climatic for the AF. The second one was related non-extreme
   thermal conditions: precipitation of the warmest quarter, interpreted as
   a thermal buffer, shared by AF and SATZ, and isothermality shared by MTZ
   and SATZ.},

Abstract = {Australian Systematic Botany has again dared to venture outside its
   usual remit to include studies on non-Australian and zoological themes.
   This first occurred in 1991 (Volume 4), in which the first issue focused
   on plant and animal distributions of the Southern Hemisphere. The issue
   proved to be so popular that it was later released as stand-alone book
   titled Austral Biogeography (Ladiges et al. 1991). That volume included
   new methods and techniques in historical biogeography at the time, as
   well as discussions on endemism and biotic areas. We have continued this
   tradition with two Special Issues focusing on similar biogeographic
   themes.},

Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {With the aim of providing information for ecological restoration
   programs, we studied reproductive phenology and seed germination of
   eight species from the tropical dry forest of Morelos, Mexico. With the
   participation of students from the local junior high school, we
   monitored monthly, over one year, the production of flowers and immature
   and mature fruits for each species. We estimated intensity, duration,
   seasonality, and synchrony for each fruiting phenophase and flowering
   duration. Germination tests were undertaken in a germination chamber (18
   degrees C-32 degrees C) and under the environmental conditions at the
   local school. We applied specific pregermination treatments for each
   species. Two distinct peaks of mature fruit production were identified:
   one at the beginning and the other in the middle of the dry season.
   Fructification seasonality was significant in most cases. Germination
   was relatively high in three legumes and particularly low in two Bursera
   species. Four species responded to the germination environments, and
   differences among pregermination treatments were significant in most
   cases. Knowledge on fruiting patterns and seed viability and germination
   will allow adequate decision-making for seed collection and plant
   propagation of the study species. Student participation increased their
   interest and knowledge on local environmental problems and solutions.},

Abstract = {The development of organ-on-chip and biological scaffolds is currently
   requiring simpler methods to microstructure biocompatible materials in
   three dimensions, fabricate structural and functional elements in
   biomaterials or modify the physicochemical properties of desired
   substrates. With the aim of creating simple, cost-effective alternatives
   to conventional existing techniques to produce such platforms with very
   specific properties, a low-power CD-DVD laser pickup head was recycled
   and mounted on a programmable three-axis micro-displacement system in
   order to modify the surface of polymeric materials in a local fashion.
   Thanks to a specially-designed method using a strongly absorbing
   additive coating the materials of interest, it has been possible to
   establish and precisely control processes useful in microtechnology for
   biomedical applications and normally restricted to much less affordable
   high-power lasers. In this work, we present our latest progress
   regarding the application of our fabrication technique to the
   development of organ-on-chip platforms thanks to the simple integration
   of several biomimetic characteristics typically achieved with
   traditional, less cost-effective microtechnology methods in one step or
   through replica-molding. Our straightforward approach indeed enables
   great control of local laser microablation for true on-demand biomimetic
   micropatterned designs in several transparent polymers and hydrogels of
   tunable stiffness and is allowing integration of microfluidics,
   microelectronics, optical waveguides, surface microstructuring and even
   transfer of superficial protein micropatterns on a variety of
   biocompatible materials. The results presented here were validated using
   hepatic and fibroblasts cell lines to demonstrate the viability of our
   procedure for organ-on-chip development and show the impact of such
   features in cell culture.},

Abstract = {Oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae) are the dominant tree genus of North America in
   species number and biomass, and Mexico is a global center of oak
   diversity. Understanding the origins of oak diversity is key to
   understanding biodiversity of northern temperate forests.
   A phylogenetic study of biogeography, niche evolution and
   diversification patterns in Quercus was performed using 300 samples, 146
   species. Next-generation sequencing data were generated using the
   restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-seq) method. A time-calibrated
   maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred and analyzed with bioclimatic,
   soils, and leaf habit data to reconstruct the biogeographic and
   evolutionary history of the American oaks.
   Our highly resolved phylogeny demonstrates sympatric parallel
   diversification in climatic niche, leaf habit, and diversification
   rates. The two major American oak clades arose in what is now the boreal
   zone and radiated, in parallel, from eastern North America into Mexico
   and Central America.
   Oaks adapted rapidly to niche transitions. The Mexican oaks are
   particularly numerous, not because Mexico is a center of origin, but
   because of high rates of lineage diversification associated with high
   rates of evolution along moisture gradients and between the evergreen
   and deciduous leaf habits. Sympatric parallel diversification in the
   oaks has shaped the diversity of North American forests.},

Abstract = {One of the most complete successions of paleozoic rocks is located at
   the Santiago-Ixtaltepec area, in Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. In this
   succession, Carboniferous rocks are formed by the Santiago
   (Tournaisian-Serpukhovian) and the Ixtal tepec (Serpukhovian-Moscovian)
   formations. The Ixtaltepec Formation has been divided into eight units
   (API-1 to API-8) characterized by fossil associations of corals,
   trilobites, bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, bryozoans, ophiuroids,
   crinoids and plant fragments, with different proportions. API-4 unit is
   composed of sandstone and shale, and their lower and medium layers
   contain few body fossils and show moderate bioturbation. The present
   study describes nine ichnotaxa collected in this unit: Cochlichnus
   anguineus, Cochlichnus isp., Lockeia siliquaria, Lockeia isp.,
   Planolites isp., Protovirgularia isp., Rhizocorallium commune, and other
   traces, tentatively assignable to ?Gordia isp. and ?Rhizocorallium isp.,
   which are grouped into three associations. These ichnoassociations
   correspond to a Cruziana icnofacies and indicate that the deposit
   occurred in the intertidal zone, in a tidal plain between mudflat and
   mixed flat, representing a shallowing stage in this area during the
   Serpukhovian-Bashkirian.},

Volume = {70},

Pages = {369-377},
Abstract = {For the hermit crabs, one of the most important resources is the shell
   of gastropod they carry along their life. This shell gives them
   different benefits like protection, refuge and prevents desiccation. The
   semi-terrestrial hermit crabs (Family Coenobitidae) perform a behavioral
   remodeling process from the inside of the gastropod shell, increasing
   its internal volume and making them lighter. In this study the
   advantages provided by remodeling a shell were evaluated with a
   locomotion approach. For this, terrestrial hermit crabs from Coenobita
   compressus species were collected in Playa Troncones, Guerrero.
   Locomotion experiments were performed where the crabs walked on wet sand
   occupying remodeled and non-remodeled shells with the purpose of measure
   their performance. Depth measurements and type of imprint were taken;
   also the walking velocity of each crab was measured. As a result we
   obtained that the hermit crabs occupying remodeled shells had a lower
   drag, shallower shell traces and they reached a greater speed.
   Therefore, the benefits of using a remodeled shell were demonstrated
   from a locomotive point of view. Besides, this study showed an
   application of the neo-ichnology as an implement in ecological and
   biological studies.},

Title = {How Widespread are Nonnative Species? Estimating Habitat Occupancy in an
   Ecological Reserve within a Megacity},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {68-87},

Abstract = {Exotic species are fairly common within cities. However, urban areas
   also contain isolated fragments of original ecosystems, which may act as
   small ecological reserves. Unfortunately, these natural areas that are
   completely surrounded by urban structures are more vulnerable to
   human-induced disturbance and to the presence of nonnative species.
   Given the importance of these remnants of original ecosystems embedded
   within cities, efforts must be made to know if, once a nonnative species
   enters an urban reserve, it occupies the majority of the area or becomes
   restricted to some specific patches. This knowledge is important to
   determine the invasiveness and success of nonnative species, as well as
   the level of threat to the native biota. Additionally, it is important
   to understand which microhabitat conditions promote the presence and
   establishment of such nonnative species. Here, we used occupancy models
   to estimate the proportion of the total area that is occupied by exotic
   species of plants and animals within a natural reserve completely
   surrounded by urban areas. We also examined which environmental factors
   are associated with the presence of these exotic plants and animals. Our
   results revealed that occupancy of nonnative species is relatively high
   (>40\%) within this urban reserve. However, we found an overall
   preference of nonnatives for specific patches of the reserve where
   human-made structures are present and where gardening activities take
   place. Some of the species that we studied deserve special attention
   because of their potential negative effects on native species.},

Abstract = {Despite its importance for carbon storage and other ecosystem functions,
   the variation in vegetation canopy height is not yet well understood. We
   examined the relationship between this community attribute and
   environmental heterogeneity in a tropical dry forest of southern Mexico.
   We sampled vegetation in 15 sites along a 100-km coastal stretch of
   Oaxaca State, and measured the heights of all woody plants (excluding
   lianas). The majority of the ca. 4000 individuals recorded concentrated
   in the 4-8 m height range. We defined three plant sets to describe
   overall community canopy height at each site: a set including all
   plants, a set made up by the tallest plants representing 10 percent of
   all individuals, and a set comprising the 10 tallest plants. For each
   site we computed maximum height and the mean and median heights of the
   three sets. Significant collinearity was observed between the seven
   resulting height variables, but null distributions constructed through
   bootstrap revealed their different behaviors as functions of species
   richness and density of individuals. Through linear modeling and a model
   selection procedure, we identified 21 models that best described the
   variation in canopy height variables. These models pointed out to soil
   (measured as PC1 of a principal component analysis performed on 10 soil
   variables), water stress, and elevation as the main drivers of canopy
   height variation in the region. In the event of increasing water stress
   resulting from global climate change, the studied tropical dry forests
   could become shorter and thus decrease their carbon storage potential.},

Title = {Functional morphology of the gonoduct of the viviparous teleost
   Poeciliopsis gracilis (Heckel, 1848) (Poeciliidae)},

Abstract = {Female teleosts do not develop Mullerian ducts; consequently, the ovary
   of teleosts contains two zones: germinal and gonoduct. The gonoduct
   lacks germinal cells, but has relevant functions in the reproductive
   process. We describe the functional morphology of the gonoduct in the
   viviparous teleost Poeciliopsis gracilis during nongestation and
   gestation stages. This study tests the hypothesis that the gonoduct
   functions as a barrier between the germinal zone and the exterior. By
   providing information about morphology and function of the gonoduct we
   show that this part of the ovary has an essential role in the
   reproduction of teleosts. The ovaries were processed by histological
   technique and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E), Masson's trichrome,
   toluidine blue and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). The gonoduct is divided
   into three regions: cephalic, middle, and caudal. In the cephalic and
   middle regions there are mucosal folds that extend into the gonoductal
   lumen, forming structures similar to a cervix. The caudal region has two
   portions: the anterior contains a dorsal invagination and exocrine
   glands among columnar cells; the posterior has a ventral flexion and
   stratified epithelium with apical secretory cells. The morphology of
   this epithelium indicates two functions: (a) secretory by the apical
   columnar cells, and (b) protection through the stratification. Another
   peculiarity of the caudal region is that both ducts, reproductive and
   digestive, converge in a common cavity at their caudal ends, forming a
   cloacal region. The histology of the gonoduct indicates relevant
   functions including: (1) the control of the luminal diameter by the
   muscle and the presence of mucosal folds, like a cervix; (2) the
   relationship with the spermatozoa during insemination and storing them
   in mucosal folds; (3) the support of immunological processes; (4)
   secretory activities; (5) forming the duct during birth; and (6)
   possibly, acts as a barrier against parasite infestations.},

Abstract = {The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus), considered
   endangered, is protected at national (Mexico) and international levels.
   Since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, sightings of manatees have been rare at
   Conil Lagoon, located within the natural reserve ``Area de Proteccion de
   Flora y Fauna Yum Balam{''}. However, increased reports of sightings
   from local fishermen and tour guides suggest manatees may be
   repopulating the. lagoon Here we report 15 sightings of the Antillean
   manatee from 2011 to 2016. Group sizes ranged from 1 to 15 individuals
   and we documented the presence of reproductive groups and mother-calf
   pairs. The apparent recovery of the species at Conil Lagoon and adjacent
   areas may be the resulit of local conservation efforts, or the result of
   changes in habitat use and distribution of the Caribbean population. A
   systematic, long-term local monitoring program is necessary to estimate
   manatee abundance and characterize their distribution in this area. (C)

Abstract = {The Nevado de Toluca is a stratovolcano located in the southwest of the
   Toluca Valley in central Mexico. At a height of around 4200 m there are
   two crater lakes: El Sol and La Luna. Since Precolumbian times, people
   in the surrounding valleys carried out rituals and deposited offerings
   into the lakes. After the Spanish conquest, these rituals were kept
   alive clandestinely. Currently, reminiscent of Mesoamerican rituals
   subsist. Due to the long duration of the ritual at the Nevado de Toluca,
   it is important to date the materials recovered in the underwater and
   terrestrial archaeological explorations. This article proposes a
   chronology of Prehispanic ritual activities performed in the Nevado de
   Toluca based on the characterization and radiocarbon (C-14) dating
   performed to materials from the volcano's lakes.},

Abstract = {Collagen associated with bone samples is frequently used for radiocarbon
   (C-14) dating of bones recovered from archaeological sites. However,
   submersion and exposure to moisture favors the degradation of collagen,
   which leads to difficulty in reliably dating bones from tropical, humid,
   or previously submerged archaeological sites. In this paper, we
   characterized the preservation state of a series of bones, through
   parameters such as \%C, \%N, C/N ratio, and collagen recovery. We
   performed C-14 analyses of three collagen fractions obtained through the
   pretreatment steps (total, ultrafiltered, and insoluble collagen) in
   order to link the preservation state and the reproducibility of C-14
   values obtained from the three fractions. Collagen ultrafiltration
   resulted in a decrease of C/N ratio, although collagen yield was
   reduced. When two or three collagen fractions were obtained, ages were
   reproducible and consistent with expected values, according to
   archaeological or hydrogeological criteria. The pretreatment steps were
   monitored by infrared spectroscopy in order to analyze the collagen
   fractions at the molecular level. The presence of collagen in the total
   and insoluble fractions was confirmed. Since many of the Mexican samples
   had poor ultrafiltered collagen yield (<3\%) or nonexistent yield, our
   results show that if additional contextual information is carefully
   considered, the remnant collagen in the total and insoluble fraction can
   be dated, especially from sites where no other datable fraction exists.},

   Mesocestoides sp. and Physalopterinae gen. sp. were found in the body
   cavity and digestive tract, respectively. Excluding the species of
   Parapharyngodon Chatterji, 1933, S. pyrocephalus is recorded for the
   first time as a host of the remaining seven taxa of helminths.
   Additionally, Thubunaea leonregagnonae sp. n. is described and
   illustrated as a new nematode species, parasite of S. pyrocephalus from
   Mexico. This new species can be differentiated from the majority of its
   congeners by the absence of spicules, the particular pattern of caudal
   papillae in males and the small ratio of oesophagus length: male total
   body length (0.1-0.16).},

Title = {Thermodynamic cost for classical counterdiabatic driving},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {96},
Number = {5},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Motivated by the recent growing interest about the thermodynamic cost of
   shortcuts to adiabaticity, we consider the cost of driving a classical
   system by the so-called counterdiabatic driving (CD). To do so, we
   proceed in three steps: first we review a general definition recently
   put forward in the literature for the thermodynamic cost of driving a
   Hamiltonian system; then we provide a new complementary definition of
   cost, which is of particular relevance for cases where the average
   excess work vanishes; finally, we apply our general framework to the
   case of CD. Interestingly, we find that in such a case our results are
   the exact classical counterparts of those reported by Funo et al.
   {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 100602 (2017)]. In particular we show that a
   universal trade-off between speed and cost for CD also exists in the
   classical case. To illustrate our points we consider the example of a
   time-dependent harmonic oscillator subject to different strategies of
   adiabatic control.},

   the Ramsey property. The question as to whether there is a tall
   definable Ramsey ideal is raised and studied. It is shown that no tall
   F-sigma. ideal is Ramsey, while there is a tall co-analytic Ramsey

Title = {Word-wide meta-analysis of Quercus forests ectomycorrhizal fungal
   diversity reveals southwestern Mexico as a hotspot},
Journal = {MYCORRHIZA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {8},
Pages = {811-822},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Quercus is the most diverse genus of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) host plants;
   it is distributed in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, from
   temperate to tropical regions. However, their ECM communities have been
   scarcely studied in comparison to those of conifers. The objectives of
   this study were to determine the richness of ECM fungi associated with
   oak forests in the Cuitzeo basin in southwestern Mexico; and to
   determine the level of richness, potential endemism and species
   similarity among ECM fungal communities associated with natural oak
   forests worldwide through a meta-analysis. The ITS DNA sequences of ECM
   root tips from 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total,
   1065 species of ECM fungi have been documented worldwide; however, 812
   species have been only found at one site. Oak forests in Europe contain
   416 species, Mexico 307, USA 285, and China 151. Species with wider
   distributions are Sebacinaceae sp. SH197130, Amanita subjunquillea,
   Cenococcum geophilum, Cortinarius decipiens, Russula hortensis, R.
   risigallina, R. subrubescens, Sebacinaceae sp. SH214607, Tomentella
   ferruginea, and T. lapida. The meta-analysis revealed (1) that Mexico is
   not only a hotspot for oak species but also for their ECM mycobionts.
   (2) There is a particularly high diversity of ECM Pezizales in oak
   seasonal forests from western USA to southwestern Mexico. (3) The oak
   forests in southwestern Mexico have the largest number of potential
   endemic species. (4) Globally, there is a high turnover of ECM fungal
   species associated with oaks, which indicates high levels of alpha and
   beta diversity in these communities.},

Title = {Higher-Order Statistical Correlations and Mutual Information Among
   Particles in a Quantum Well},
Journal = {FEW-BODY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The influence of wave function symmetry on statistical correlation is
   studied for the case of three non-interacting spin-free quantum
   particles in a unidimensional box, in position and in momentum space.
   Higher-order statistical correlations occurring among the three
   particles in this quantum system is quantified via higher-order mutual
   information and compared to the correlation between pairs of variables
   in this model, and to the correlation in the two-particle system. The
   results for the higher-order mutual information show that there are
   states where the symmetric wave functions are more correlated than the
   antisymmetric ones with same quantum numbers. This holds in position as
   well as in momentum space. This behavior is opposite to that observed
   for the correlation between pairs of variables in this model, and the
   two-particle system, where the antisymmetric wave functions are in
   general more correlated. These results are also consistent with those
   observed in a system of three uncoupled oscillators. The use of
   higher-order mutual information as a correlation measure, is monitored
   and examined by considering a superposition of states or systems with
   two Slater determinants.},

Abstract = {The Lerma-Chapala Basin, in Central Mexico, is geologically
   heterogeneous, climatically diverse and boasts high biodiversity, lying
   within two Biodiversity Hotspots, namely Mesoamerica and the Madrean
   Pine-Oak Woodlands. Epilithon and water samples were collected in the
   basin from 14 sampling sites three times each, two sampling campaigns
   during the rainy season and one in the dry season. A total of 274
   infrageneric taxa in 48 genera were recorded. The taxonomic composition
   observed was dominated by taxa from the genera Nitzschia, Gomphonema,
   Pinnularia, Navicula, Sellaphora and Eunotia. About a third of the taxa
   found could not be identified to the species level. From those
   unidentified morphodemes, two are described as new species, namely
   Brachysira altepetlensis and Sellaphora queretana. Furthermore, Eolimna
   rhombica is transferred to Sellaphora. Canonical Correspondence Analysis
   (CCA) revealed that specific conductivity and pH were the main
   environmental factors driving the community composition observed. Three
   groups of samples were identified after the CCA: 1) characterized by
   acidic waters and low conductivity; 2) with circumneutral waters, low
   specific conductivity and high temperature and phosphorous
   concentrations; and 3) characterized by circumneutral waters, high
   conductivity and low nitrogen concentrations. The indicator value method
   (IndVal), based on the relative abundance and relative frequency of the
   most abundant taxa was calculated based on the groups observed in the
   CCA, identifying the characteristic taxa for each of the three groups.},

Title = {Improved method for genomic DNA extraction for Opuntia Mill.
   (Cactaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT METHODS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Background: Genomic DNA extracted from species of Cactaceae is often
   contaminated with significant amounts of mucilage and pectin. Pectin is
   one of the main components of cellular walls, whereas mucilage is a
   complex polysaccharide with a ramified structure. Thus, pectin-and
   mucilage-free extraction of DNA is a key step for further downstream
   PCR-based analyses.
   Results: We tested our DNA extraction method on cladode tissue
   (juvenile, adult, and herbaria exemplars) of 17 species of Opuntia
   Mill., which are characterized by a large quantity of pectin and
   mucilage.
   Conclusion: We developed a method for the extraction of gDNA free of
   inhibitory compounds common in species of Opuntia Mill., such as pectin
   and mucilage. Compared to previously extraction protocols, our method
   produced higher yields of high-quality genomic DNA.},

Abstract = {Applying the generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) formalism, we
   extend the BCS-Bose crossover theory by explicitly including hole Cooper
   pairs (2hCPs). From this follows a phase diagram with two pure phases,
   one with 2hCPs and the other with electron Cooper pairs (2eCPs), plus a
   mixed phase with arbitrary proportions of 2eCPs and 2hCPs. One has a
   special-case phase when there is perfect symmetry (i.e., with, ideal
   50-50 proportions between 2eCPs and 2hCPs). Explicitly including 2hCPs
   leads to an extended BCS-Bose crossover which predicts T-C/T-F values
   for some well-known conventional superconductors (SCs) (i.e., assuming
   electron-phonon dynamics). These compare reasonably well with
   experimental data. We compare with experimental T-C/T-F values for some
   conventional SCs associated with the new dimensionless number density
   n/n(f) with theoretical curves associated with the extended crossover
   for the special case of perfect symmetry. They all obey the Bogoliubov
   et al. upper limit, thus vindicating it.},

Abstract = {The generalized Bose Einstein condensation (GBEC) theory of
   superconductivity (SC) is briefly surveyed. It hinges on three distinct
   new ingredients: (i) Treatment of Cooper pairs (CPs) as actual bosons
   since they obey Bose statistics, in contrast to BCS pairs which do not
   obey Bose commutation relations; (ii) inclusion of two-hole Cooper pairs
   (2hCPs) on an equal footing with two-electron Cooper pairs (2eCPs), thus
   making this a complete boson-fermion (BF) model; and (iii) inclusion in
   the resulting ternary ideal BF gas with particular BF vertex
   interactions that drive boson formation/disintegration processes. GBEC
   subsumes as special cases both BCS (having its 50-50 symmetry of both
   kinds of CPs) and ordinary BEC theories (having no 2hCPs), as well as
   the now familiar BCS-Bose crossover theory. We extended the crossover
   theory with the explicit inclusion of 2hCPs and construct a phase
   diagram of T-c/T-F versus n/n(f), where T-c and T-F are the critical and
   Fermi temperatures, n is the total number density and n(f) that of
   unbound electrons at T = 0. Also, with this extended crossover one can
   construct the energy gap Delta(T)/Delta(0) versus T/T-c for some
   elemental SCs by solving at least two equations numerically: a gap-like
   and a number equation. In 50-50 symmetry, the energy gap curve agrees
   quite well with experimental data. But ignoring 2hCPs altogether leads
   to the gap curve falling substantially below that with 50-50 symmetry
   which already fits the data quite well, showing that 2hCPs are
   indispensable to describe SCs.},

Title = {Evolutionary patterns in life-history traits of lizards of the genus
   Xenosaurus},
Journal = {HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {346-360},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Life histories are directly related to fitness and, hence, are the focus
   of strong selective pressures. However, different life-history traits
   may evolve at different paces and may respond differentially to
   particular selective pressures. We examined patterns of evolutionary
   change in the following life-history traits of xenosaurid lizards: size
   at maturity, average size of adult females, litter size, neonate size,
   and relative litter mass. We used a phylogenetic hypothesis of the genus
   Xenosaurus and different phylogenetic comparative methods to search for
   evolutionary relationships between traits as well as to estimate
   ancestral states, rates of evolution, and the amount of phylogenetic
   signal on each trait. In addition, we searched for differences in these
   life-history traits among the different environments where these lizards
   inhabit (cloud forest, tropical forest, oak-pine forest, and xeric
   scrub). We found an evolutionary relationship between size at maturity
   and average adult size, with larger species maturing at larger sizes. We
   also found an evolutionary trade-off between litter size and neonate
   size. Ancestral state reconstructions revealed differences among traits
   in the relative timing of diversification. Litter size and neonate size
   began diversification early in the history of the genus. In contrast,
   size at maturity and relative litter mass remained phenotypically
   invariant for a long time period before diverging into distinct
   phenotypic values. Litter size exhibited significant phylogenetic signal
   because the diversification history of this trait has tracked the
   phylogeny closely. The observed variation among species in neonate size
   also showed some trace of the phylogenetic relationships. The remaining
   three traits diverged throughout time without a clear phylogenetic
   pattern. In addition, litter size and relative litter mass exhibited the
   highest evolutionary rates whereas average adult size and neonate size
   exhibited the lowest rates. Litter size was the only trait that differed
   significantly among environments, with largest litters in cloud forests.
   We discuss potential hypotheses to explain the observed differences
   among life-history traits in the tempo and mode of evolution.},

Title = {Controlled Solvent-Free Formation of Embedded PDMS-Derived Carbon
   Nanodomains with Tunable Fluorescence Using Selective Laser Ablation
   with A Low-Power CD Laser},
Journal = {MICROMACHINES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We present a study of the application of a single-step and solvent-free
   laser-based strategy to control the formation of polymer-derived
   fluorescent carbon nanodomains embedded in poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   microchannels. A low-power, laser-induced microplasma was used to
   produce a localised combustion of a PDMS surface and confine nanocarbon
   byproducts within the exposed microregions. Patterns with on-demand
   geometries were achieved under dry environmental conditions thanks to a
   low-cost 3-axis CD-DVD platform motorised in a selective laser ablation
   fashion. The high temperature required for combustion of PDMS was
   achieved locally by strongly focusing the laser spot on the desired
   areas, and the need for high-power laser was bypassed by coating the
   surface with an absorbing carbon additive layer, hence making the
   etching of a transparent material possible. The simple and repeatable
   fabrication process and the spectroscopic characterisation of resulting
   fluorescent microregions are reported. In situ Raman and fluorescence
   spectroscopy were used to identify the nature of the nanoclusters left
   inside the modified areas and their fluorescence spectra as a function
   of excitation wavelength. Interestingly, the carbon nanodomains left
   inside the etched micropatterns showed a strong dependency on the
   additive materials and laser energy that were used to achieve the
   incandescence and etch microchannels on the surface of the polymer. This
   dependence on the lasing conditions indicates that our cost-effective
   laser ablation technique may be used to tune the nature of the
   polymer-derived nanocarbons, useful for photonics applications in
   transparent silicones in a rapid-prototyping fashion.},

   reveals that our samples form a newly recognized clade distinct and

   previously proposed synonymy between Hapalospongidion and Mesospora, we
   conclude that both are distinct genera. We also provide a different
   interpretation of a diagnostic character that allows a distinction of
   Basispora from the latter two genera. We propose the erection of the new
   family Hapalospongidiaceae to accommodate the sole genus

Title = {High-order implicit finite difference schemes for the two-dimensional
   Poisson equation},
Journal = {APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {309},
Pages = {222-244},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {In this paper, a new family of high-order finite difference schemes is
   proposed to solve the two-dimensional Poisson equation by implicit
   finite difference formulas of (2M + 1) operator points. The implicit
   formulation is obtained from Taylor series expansion and wave plane
   theory analysis, and it is constructed from a few modifications to the
   standard finite difference schemes. The approximations achieve
   (2M+4)-order accuracy for the inner grid points and up to eighth-order
   accuracy for the boundary grid points. Using a Successive
   Over-Relaxation method, the high-order implicit schemes have faster
   convergence as M is increased, compensating the additional computation
   of more operator points. Thus, the proposed solver results in an
   attractive method, easy to implement, with higher order accuracy but
   nearly the same computation cost as those of explicit or compact
   formulation. In addition, particular case M = 1 yields a new compact
   finite difference schemes of sixth-order of accuracy. Numerical
   experiments are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed
   method and the high accuracy of these difference schemes. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Species invasions represent a significant dimension of global change yet
   the dynamics of invasions remain poorly understood and are considered
   rather unpredictable. We explored interannual dynamics of the invasion
   process in the Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and tested
   whether the advance of the invasion front of the species in North
   America relates to centrality (versus peripherality) within its
   estimated fundamental ecological niche. We used ecological niche
   modelling approaches to estimate the dimensions of the fundamental
   ecological niche on the Old World distribution of the species, and then
   transferred that model to the New World as measures of centrality versus
   peripherality within the niche for the species. Although our hypothesis
   was that the invasion front would advance faster over more favourable
   (i.e. more central) conditions, the reverse was the case: the invasion
   expanded faster in areas presenting less favourable (i.e. more
   peripheral) conditions for the species as it advanced across North
   America. This result offers a first view of a predictive approach to the
   dynamics of species' invasions, and thereby has relevant implications
   for the management of invasive species, as such a predictive
   understanding would allow better anticipation of coming steps and
   advances in the progress of invasions, important to designing and
   guiding effective remediation and mitigation efforts.},

Title = {Data Descriptor: AmphiBIO, a global database for amphibian ecological
   traits},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Current ecological and evolutionary research are increasingly moving
   from species-to trait-based approaches because traits provide a stronger
   link to organism's function and fitness. Trait databases covering a
   large number of species are becoming available, but such data remains
   scarce for certain groups. Amphibians are among the most diverse
   vertebrate groups on Earth, and constitute an abundant component of
   major terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. They are also facing rapid
   population declines worldwide, which is likely to affect trait
   composition in local communities, thereby impacting ecosystem processes
   and services. In this context, we introduce AmphiBIO, a comprehensive
   database of natural history traits for amphibians worldwide. The
   database releases information on 17 traits related to ecology,
   morphology and reproduction features of amphibians. We compiled data
   from more than 1,500 literature sources, and for more than 6,500 species
   of all orders (Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona), 61 families and 531
   genera. This database has the potential to allow unprecedented
   large-scale analyses in ecology, evolution, and conservation of
   amphibians.},

Title = {Impact of mass gain, tailwind and age on the performance of Usain Bolt
   from Beijing 2008 to Rio 2016},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Despite the impressiveness of the sprints run by Usain Bolt, the
   question naturally arises of why he has not been able to break the 100 m
   sprint world record he set in Berlin (2009). In this paper, we address
   such a query by considering Bolt's condition and the prevailing
   circumstances during the sprints that took place in Beijing 2008, Berlin
   2009, London 2012, Moscow 2013, Beijing 2015 and Rio 2016(3). Using the
   analytical mechanical model by Hernandez-Gomez et al (2013), we analyse
   all the events, equating what we thought were the principal factors a
   priori: tailwind, weight gain and age. Despite what one might expect
   about the role of age in such a high-performance athlete as Usain Bolt,
   our results show that his performance has been essentially constant from
   Beijing 2009 to Rio 2016, with the mass gain and tailwind conditions
   making the difference in the run times he has achieved since Berlin
   2009. Actually, our analysis suggests that in equal mass and tailwind
   conditions, his world record could actually have been set at Beijing
   2015.},

Abstract = {Characteristics of buildings and land cover surrounding buildings
   influence the number of bird-window collisions, yet little is known
   about whether bird-window collisions are associated with urbanization at
   large spatial scales. We initiated a continent-wide study in North
   America to assess how bird-window collision mortality is influenced by
   building characteristics, landscaping around buildings, and regional
   urbanization. In autumn 2014, researchers at 40 sites (N = 281
   buildings) used standardized protocols to document collision mortality
   of birds, evaluate building characteristics, and measure local land
   cover and regional urbanization. Overall, 324 bird carcasses were
   observed (range = 0-34 per site) representing 71 species. Consistent
   with previous studies, we found that building size had a strong positive
   effect on bird-window collision mortality, but the strength of the
   effect on mortality depended on regional urbanization. The positive
   relationship between collision mortality and building size was greatest
   at large buildings in regions of low urbanization, locally extensive
   lawns, and low density structures. Collision mortality was consistently
   low for small buildings, regardless of large-scale urbanization. The
   mechanisms shaping broad-scale variation in collision mortality during
   seasonal migration may be related to habitat selection at a hierarchy of
   scales and behavioral divergence between urban and rural bird
   populations. These results suggest that collision prevention measures
   should be prioritized at large buildings in regions of low urbanization
   throughout North America.},

   parmentieri (Aspargaceae)},
Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-422},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Reproductive traits are features of a species' biology that
   may determine its rarity, as they affect its genetic diversity and
   structure, as well as its population dynamics.
   Study species: The rare and threatened species Furcraea parmentieri,
   whose distribution is limited to the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt.
   Questions: How is the reproductive phenology of F. parmentieri? Does
   flower morphology vary between individuals? Does it produce nectar?
   Which animals visit its flowers? Is it self-compatible? Do the seeds
   originated via different pollination treatments show differences in
   their germinability?
   Study sites and dates: We studied the F. parmentieri from 2007 to 2008,
   at El Xitle volcano (altitude: 2,800-3,100 m; pine-oak forest), in the
   south of Mexico City.
   Methods: Reproductive phenology was recorded through fortnightly visits
   to the study site. Flowers were collected, flower visitors were recorded
   and nectar production was measured. An experiment was done which
   included four treatments: autonomous pollination, geitonogamy, cross
   pollination, and a control. We measured seed set, fruit set and seed
   germination in each treatment.
   Results: Inflorescences started in January and flowering finished in
   May. Fruit maturation took from May to November. Nectar production was
   negligible. Flowers were visited by hawkmoths and hummingbirds. Fruit
   set was very low (ca. 5 \%) and we observed self-incompatibility.
   Conclusions: Fucraeae parmentieri presents a low fruit set due to
   pollinator limitation. However the population seems to be thriving. The
   main threat faced by this species is the high land-use change rate along
   its distribution range, as well as climate change.},

Journal = {HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {266-275},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Toe-clipping is an extensively used technique for individual
   identification of amphibians and reptiles. However, this method might
   result in negative effects including reduced survival. In this study, we
   used capture-mark-recapture data obtained from ten different lizard
   species, including more than one population for two species, to examine
   whether survival rates varied as a function of the number of toes that
   were clipped. We used likelihood methods and multi-state models to
   estimate survival probabilities. Specifically, we tested if the number
   of clipped toes had an effect on annual survival, comparing survival
   among groups of individuals that shared the same number of toes that
   were clipped. We found clear reductions in survival associated with the
   removal of several toes in seven study sites that correspond to five
   different species. These represent 37\% of all the species and
   populations that we examined. Therefore, we conclude that this marking
   method potentially causes severe damage and may lead to biased parameter
   estimates in ecological studies of lizard species. Whenever possible,
   toe-clipping should be avoided and replaced by less invasive methods for
   individual identification.},

Abstract = {A minimum feedback arc set of a digraph D is a minimum set of arcs which
   removal leaves the resultant graph free of directed cycles; its
   cardinality is denoted by tau(1)(D). The acyclic disconnection of D,
   (omega) over right arrow (D), is defined as the maximum number of colors
   in a vertex coloring of D such that every directed cycle of D contains
   at least one monochromatic arc. In this article we study the
   relationship between the minimum feedback arc set and the acyclic
   disconnection of a digraph, we prove that the acyclic disconnection
   problem is NP-complete. We define the acyclic disconnection and the
   minimum feedback for graphs. We also prove that (omega) over right arrow
   (G)+ tau(1)(G) |V(G)| if G is a wheel, a grid or an outerplanar graph.

Title = {Formation and interaction of multiple dipoles in a periodic driving flow},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {386-397},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {We present herein the results of a numerical simulation of a periodic
   flow which take place in a channel and an open domain. To investigate
   this flow we solve the fluid dynamics equations in the vorticity-stream
   function formulation by using a pseudospectral method based on Chebyshev
   polynomials. According to these numerical simulations, a pair of
   counter-rotating vortices (known as a dipole) forms during each period.
   The lifetime of these vortices can exceed the driving period, which
   allows multiple dipoles to coexist. The attention is focused on the
   interaction of vortices. A possible outcome is that dipoles created in
   consecutive periods coalesce. Another outcome is the formation of
   vorticity spots in front of the emerging dipole which reduce the dipole
   speed. On the other hand, it is observed that a fraction of the
   vorticity created into the channel cannot incorporate to the vortices,
   leading to the formation of a vorticity band between the channel mouth
   and the dipole. Based on this fact an analytical model is proposed to
   describe the properties of dipoles emerging from the channel; the
   results of this model are consistent with numerical data. The parameters
   governing the development of this flow are the Strouhal number, whose
   value determines the intensity of the dipole interaction, and the
   Reynolds number, whose growth leads to the emergence of instabilities
   and to the breaking of the flow symmetries.},

Abstract = {Track analysis is the core of panbiogeographic analysis. In this work,
   we reflect on the formalization of track analysis, its methodological
   issues, and interpretations by using new software developments and from
   a contemporary evolutionary biogeographical viewpoint. From a geometric
   perspective, we analyze the meaning of a minimal spanning tree,
   considering that Prim's algorithm is the most commonly used to draw
   individual tracks. We then show the existing methodologies (graphs, PAE,
   combined method, AE) and software packages (Trazos2004, Croizat,
   Martitracks, fossil) used to perform track analysis. Finally, we
   illustrate a track analysis using Nearctic mammals as an example. Based
   on our review, connectivity matrix analysis may be the best way to
   associate individual tracks into generalized tracks because it compares
   the minimal spanning tree topologies. However, it is the most demanding
   of all methods, since it requires a high spatial congruence among
   species, and therefore more algorithmic development.},

Abstract = {We give a characterization of knots of tunnel number 1 that admit an
   essential meridional torus with two boundary components. Let K be a knot
   in S-3, S an essential meridional torus in the exterior of K with two
   boundary components, and tau an unknotting tunnel for K. We consider the
   intersections between S and tau. If the intersection is empty, we
   conclude that the knot K is an iterate of a satellite knot of tunnel
   number 1 and one of its unknotting tunnels, and then S is knotted as a
   nontrivial torus knot. If the intersection is nonempty, we simplify it
   as much as possible, and conclude that the knot K is a. (1, 1)-knot; it
   follows from known results that in some cases the torus S is knotted as
   a nontrivial torus knot, while in others cases the torus S is unknotted.},

Title = {Taphonomic history of a `duck-bill' dinosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda)

Abstract = {The Cerro del Pueblo Formation in the state of Coahuila, Mexico is
   becoming recognized worldwide due to its abundant and diverse fossil
   material. While most previous paleontological work from this rock unit
   has been directed towards taxonomic investigation, this study is
   directed towards the taphonomy of a ``duck-billed{''} dinosaur
   (Ornithischia: Hadrosauridae). The hadrosaur skeleton is represented by
   several skull bones, vertebrae and ribs, a scapula, pubis, and various
   appendicular elements. The following taphonomic parameters were
   considered: (1) bone frequency; (2) hydraulic equivalence; (3) degree of
   bone articulation; (4) abrasion; (5) weathering; (6) breakage; (7) tooth
   marks; and (8) trampling activities. The low degree of weathering and
   abrasion suggests that the specimen experienced a short time of
   subaerial exposure and underwent a short transportation distance before
   deposition. Burial occurred within a perimarine lagoonal environment.
   Furthermore, the lack of hydraulic equivalence with the rock matrix, a
   high degree of disarticulation and a chaotic distribution of the bones
   in the fossiliferous bed, suggest that it was transported as a ``bloated
   carcass{''}. The finding of distinct types of tooth marks evidence some
   sort of predator/scavenging activities on the specimen. Finally, an
   almost vertical orientation of various bones and the presence of spiral
   fractures may indicate that these elements were trampled by other
   animals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is considered as a major cause
   of the failure in cancer chemotherapy. The acquisition of MDR is usually
   mediated by the overexpression of drug efflux pumps of a P-glycoprotein.
   The development of compounds that mitigate the MDR phenotype by
   modulating the activity of these transport proteins is an important yet
   elusive target. Here, we screened the saponification and enzymatic
   degradation products from Salvia hispanica seed's mucilage to discover
   modulating compounds of the acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic in
   breast cancer cells. Preparative-scale recycling HPLC was used to purify
   the hydrolysis degradation products. All compounds were tested in eight
   different cancer cell lines and Vero cells. All compounds were
   noncytotoxic at the concentration tested against the drug-sensitive and
   multidrug-resistant cells (IC50>29.2M). For the all products, a moderate
   vinblastine-enhancing activity from 4.55-fold to 6.82-fold was observed.
   That could be significant from a therapeutic perspective. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {Mn-doped lithium niobate necklace-like nanofibers were synthesized by
   the electrospinning method. The morphology, microstructure and crystal
   structure of as-spun and annealed composite nanofibers were
   characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Ab initio simulations were
   performed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework as
   implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), within
   the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) scheme. Lattice-dynamic calculations
   of the phonon modes were performed at the zone center (Gamma point) of
   the BZ and the dynamical matrix was calculated using the direct method,
   implemented in the PHONON code. By comparing experimental Raman spectra
   of pure and Mn-doped LiNbO3, and the results of the calculations, we
   were able to probe Mn ion incorporation into the LiNbO3 lattice and show
   that Mn substitutes Li sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Operational, financial and conceptual issues hinder protected area (PA)
   conservation goals, particularly in mega-diverse countries where highly
   impoverished human communities live within their boundaries. We (a)
   highlight the relevance of community-based biological monitoring for
   linking local communities with PAs to enhance their functionality,
   achieve conservation objectives and promote social development, (b)
   pinpoint key elements for establishing community-based biological
   monitoring programs and (c) propose an inclusive model for PAs where the
   active participation of communities is essential. Through
   community-based biological monitoring, PAs enhance the performance of
   species monitoring, surveillance, development and operation of
   management plans, local communities' engagement in conservation, and
   research activities. In turn, communities increase their knowledge on
   local natural resources, and acquire abilities needed to identify and
   quantify them, and ultimately lead to more informed decisions regarding
   their management and conservation. It is essential to consider PAs and
   local communities as a unit to achieve an integrated conservation
   approach. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

Title = {Water assessment in a peri-urban watershed in Mexico City: A focus on an
   ecosystem services approach},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},

Abstract = {Among hydrological ecosystem services, water supply is one of the most
   relevant to society because of its role in human wellbeing; accordingly,
   it has been significantly modified worldwide. There has been a recent
   increase in the necessity of combining methods and tools to create
   interdisciplinary evaluations of water ecosystem services, especially in
   developing countries where there is a lack of systematized and updated
   socioenvironmental information. We propose a framework for the
   assessment of water supply ecosystem services that includes
   environmental, social and economic dimensions. We describe and develop
   each of these dimensions with a particular focus on identifying the key
   variables that are needed to answer them. First, we performed research
   of the literature regarding the evaluation methods that are sufficiently
   flexible to apply them to local scales in countries where information is
   limited. Then, we chose the Magdalena River Watershed to apply this
   perspective because it is an illustrative area of vital importance to
   Mexico City's ecosystem services. We believe that this proposal has
   outlined basic guidelines to help decision makers improve water
   management and may provide an opportunity to change public policies on
   peri-urban ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Completeness type properties on Cp(X, Y) spaces},
Journal = {TOPOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {219},
Pages = {90-110},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {In this paper we improve several results presented in {[}7] and in {[}9]
   related to the characterization of several kinds of pseudocompleteness
   and compactness properties in spaces of continuous functions of the form
   C-p, (X, Y). In particular, we prove that for every Tychonoff space X
   and every separable metrizable topological group G for which C-p (X, G)
   is dense in G(x), C-p(X, G) is weakly alpha-favorable if and only if X
   is u(G)-discrete. This result helps us to obtain two generalizations of
   a theorem due to V.V. Tkachuk in {[}24]:
   Theorem I (5.5). Let G be a separable completely metrizable topological
   group and X a set. If H is a dense subgroup of G(x) and H is
   homeomorphic to G(Y) for some set Y, then H = G(x) A particular and
   interesting case is when X is a Tychonoff space and H = C-p(X, G) is
   dense in G(x).
   Theorem II (6.9). Let G be a realcompact Cech-complete weakly
   alpha-favorable topological group with countable pseudocharacter and let
   X be regular C-<omega(G)-discrete. Then, C-p(X,G) congruent to G(kappa)
   if and only if X is a discrete space of cardinality kappa.
   Besides, we obtain several applications to weakly pseudocompact spaces.

Title = {Late Pleistocene-Holocene variability in the southern Gulf of Mexico
   surface waters based on planktonic foraminiferal assemblages},
Journal = {MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {44-58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are used as proxies of surface
   ocean variations, as documented in five marine sediment cores from the
   Bay of Campeche (BoC), Gulf of Mexico (GoM), spanning the last 34,000
   cal yrs BP. This paper seeks to better understand the regional history
   by studying cores taken in the poorly studied Southern GoM. Multivariate
   factor analyses calculated five assemblages at millennial to
   glacial-interglacial scales. During the last glacial period, including
   the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the assemblage contained G. inflata, and
   T. sacculifer which suggests the presence of colder and less saline
   waters than younger times; although during the LGM, saltier waters and
   weaker ocean circulation may have occurred. During the deglaciation, the
   deep-dweller G. crassaformis suggest a reorganization of
   deep-thermocline waters and the establishment of transitional
   conditions, where mild to warm waters entered the Gulf. During the early
   to mid-Holocene, the tolerant tropical species G. tuber pink suggests
   salinity variations and warmer conditions than the previous interval.
   During the late-Holocene, only warm species comprise the assemblage,
   where the group G. menardii and G. truncatulinoindes suggest warm and
   stratified conditions, with an oxygen decrease in the thermocline, and
   rather high salinity levels linked to reduced moisture exported from the
   Pacific due to the progressively more influential ENSO-like conditions.
   Prominently, all the assemblages include the species G. ruber white
   chromotype, suggesting that the environmental conditions are
   continuously favorable to this abundant species. These scenarios show
   agreement to previous reconstructions in northern and western GoM, the
   Caribbean, as well as paleoclimate on land, which are mostly regulated
   by the position of the ITCZ, changes in the expansion of the Atlantic
   Warm Pool, the tropical circulation, and teleconnections with nearby
   regions.},

Abstract = {Jatropha spp. from Mexico includes high species richness and endemism;
   five species inhabit in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve (TCBR),
   and they are important resources as food, medicine and biofuel. The
   assessment of morphological and agronomic characteristics is essential
   to identify, use and maintain plant genetic resources. Given the lack of
   information on the morphological variability of Jatropha species in
   relation to environment, the objective was to analyze the influence of
   physiographic, climatic, and anthropogenic factors in the morphological
   variability of the species: Jatropha neopauciflora and J. rzedowskii,
   both not-endangered; J. oaxacana, special protection; J. ciliata and J.
   rufescens, both endangered in the Reserve. Twelve quantitative
   morphological variables were measured in 24 populations of these
   species; 14 environmental variables were registered, and the disturbance
   index in the sites was estimated. The information was analyzed with
   Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Cluster Analysis and Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis (CCA). PCA detected interspecific variation: J.
   ciliata and J. rufescens have longer and broader leaves and longer
   flowers, while the other three species have smaller leaves and flowers.
   J. oaxacana population has intermediate size of leaves, fruits and
   seeds, compared with those of J. neopauciflora and J. rzedowskii. CCA
   detected intra-specific variation among the populations of J.
   neopauciflora and J. rzedowskii, which were separated in two groups due
   to fruit and seed size. Axis 1 of CCA correlated positively with
   altitude and annual temperature range, and negatively with mean annual
   temperature; at the intra-specific level, both species are adapted to
   variations of temperature and altitude.},

Title = {Coping with stressful environments: An experimental study of seed

   conditions},

Abstract = {Seed germination and seedling survival are fundamental processes in the
   life cycle of Podostemaceae, the largest family of strictly aquatic
   angiosperms. However, few studies to date have addressed seed
   germination and seedling survival of Podostemaceae under natural
   conditions. To fill this gap, we performed a field experiment to study
   the seed germination and seedling survival of Marathrum foeniculaceum
   and Noveloa coulteriana, two species of Podostemaceae, in two rivers
   with contrasting light incidence, the Boca de Tomatlan (BT) and Las
   Juntas del Tuito (LJ) Rivers, in Jalisco, Mexico. We found significant
   differences in the final proportion of seeds germinated between M.
   foeniculaceum (67.74\%) and N. coulteriana (32.5\%), and the proportion
   of seeds germinated in the BT river (higher light incidence) was
   significantly higher than in the LI river. Likewise, seeds germinated
   more quickly in M. foeniculaceum than in N. coulteriana, and in the BT
   river than in the LJ river. Final seedling survival of both M.
   foeniculaceum and N. coulteriana was rather low (2.53\% and 1.08\%,
   respectively), but no significant differences were detected between
   species or rivers. This paper represents one of the first studies to
   experimentally evaluate aspects of the ecophysiology of seed germination
   and seedling survival of Podostemaceae under natural conditions, and it
   contributes to our understanding of the ecology and conservation of this
   particular family of plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A natural regionalization of the world based on primary biogeographic

Abstract = {Primary biogeographic homology implies that different taxa are
   spatiotemporally integrated in a biota with a common biogeographic
   history, namely naturalness. Primary spatial homology includes the
   identification of areas of endemism. Therefore, the first step to
   approach a natural regionalization is to identify the patterns of
   endemism. In order to achieve this, I obtained the areas of endemism of
   terrestrial mammals of the world at two different spatial scales of
   analysis using a Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE): 8 degrees
   latitude-longitude (families and genera) and 4 degrees
   latitude-longitude (species). Fourteen general patterns, summarized from
   54 areas of endemism, were recovered for the 8 degrees scale, whereas 44
   general patterns, from 176 areas of endemism, were recovered for the 4
   degrees scale. At both scales, there were patterns of successively
   nested endemism. In general, I found evidence for maintaining the
   regionalization proposed by Wallace in 1876 (Australian, Ethiopian,
   Neotropical, and Oriental regions), and I also found evidence supporting
   the addition of new regions, such as the Andean region. Other Wallace's
   regions were not recovered completely, such as the Nearctic and
   Palearctic regions, probably due to several biotic interchanges between
   them. Some transition zones were recovered (South American Transition
   Zone and Mediterranean). I also identified endemic species for small
   areas of endemism that may represent provinces. The results of this work
   can be used to propose hypotheses of secondary spatial homology and for
   making better inferences about the history of the biotas. (C) 2016 The

Journal = {DISCUSSIONES MATHEMATICAE GRAPH THEORY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-129},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Let D be a digraph with set of vertices V and set of arcs A. We say that
   D is k-transitive if for every pair of vertices u, v is an element of V,
   the existence of a uv-path of length k in D implies that (u, v) E A. A
   2-transitive digraph is a transitive digraph in the usual sense.
   A subset N of V is k-independent if for every pair of vertices u, v is
   an element of N, we have d(u, v), d(v, u) >= k; it is l-absorbent if for
   every u is an element of V \textbackslash{} N there exists v is an
   element of N such that d(u, v) <= 1. A k-kernel of D is a k-independent
   and (k-1)-absorbent subset of V. The problem of determining whether a
   digraph has a k-kernel is known to be NP-complete for every k >= 2.
   In this work, we characterize 4-transitive digraphs having a 3-kernel
   and also 4-transitive digraphs having a 2-kernel. Using the latter
   result, a proof of the Laborde-Payan-Xuong conjecture for 4-transitive
   digraphs is given. This conjecture establishes that for every digraph D,
   an independent set can be found such that it intersects every longest
   path in D. Also, Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture is verified
   for 4-transitive digraphs and further problems are proposed.},

Volume = {86},
Pages = {46-52},
Abstract = {HPLC analysis of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicine concentrations obtained
   from fruits of Capsicum annuum var. glabrisculum, collected from four
   localities in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, was investigated.
   Selection of localities for this study was carried out considering that
   65\% of the people living in them gather wild chilli pepper for either
   autoconsumption or commercial purposes. An ANOVA analysis was carried
   out for determining capsaicinoids composition variation. Also, a
   multivariate analysis was carried out using Pearson correlation and
   principal components analysis to elucidate the influence that
   environmental factors might have on capsaicinoids concentration. Fruits
   from the locality El Gavilan had the higher concentration of capsaicine
   among the populations examined. Also, fruits from this location had the
   higher concentration for both alcaloids (994 mu g/g), and the locality
   Comas Altas showed the lower concentration with 498 mu g/g. A positive
   correlation between capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin concentrations was
   found. PCA analysis showed that altitude, temperature and vegetation
   were the main factors responsible for the production of both alcaloids
   in C. annuum var. glabriusculum, and rainfall was the less important
   variable. Regarding the effects of altitude on alcaloids production it
   was found that locality El Gavilan, placed 578 ma.s.l., had the higher
   concentration for both alcaloids whereas the locality Comas Altas,
   placed at 65 ma.s.l., showed the lower concentrations. Locality La San
   Juana also had high concentrations of capsaicinoids. Apparently, this
   was due to the microclimate conditions present on the vegetation types
   on the above mentioned localities. Results showed that pungency degree
   of C. annuum var. glabriusculum fruits was influenced by environmental
   factors such as altitude, temperature and vegetation.},

Title = {Critical role of spatial information from chiral-asymmetric peptides in

Abstract = {The earliest functional living system on Earth should have been able to
   reproduce an ordered configuration and a self-organization dynamics. It
   was capable of resisting a random variability in time and space to keep
   the functionality. Amino acids (AAs) and nucleobases generated from
   abiotic reactions as seen in laboratory-based experiments have
   demonstrated that molecular elements for life can be obtained by
   predictable physicochemical processes. However, a functional,
   self-organized living system needs complex molecular interactions to
   endure. In this paper, we address the transference of spatial
   information on highly enantiopure polymers as a critical condition to
   support the dynamics in a self-organized biogenic system. Previous
   scenarios have considered almost exclusively the information encoded in
   sequences as the suitable source of prebiotic information. But the
   spatial information transference has been poorly understood thus far. We
   provide the supporting statements which predict that the ordered
   configuration in a biogenic system should be significantly influenced by
   spatial information, instead of being exclusively generated by sequences
   of polymers. This theoretical approach takes into consideration that the
   properties of mutation and inheritance did not develop before definition
   of the structures that allow the management of information. Rather, we
   postulate that the molecular structures to store and transfer
   information must exist at first, in order to retain particular
   functional meaning', and subsequently, such information can be
   inherited' and eventually modified. Thus, the present contribution
   follows the theory that life was originated from an unstable prebiotic
   environment that involves the early spatial information transference
   based on large chiral asymmetry.},

Title = {Comparative morphology and genetics of two populations of spiny lizards
   (genus Sceloporus) from Central Mexico},
Journal = {ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {267},
Pages = {21-30},
Abstract = {The spiny lizard Sceloporus minor exhibits substantial variation in a
   variety of life history traits, but the factors promoting this variation
   remain unclear. We analyzed within- and between-population variation in
   morphological traits in two populations (El.Enzuelado and La Manzana,
   Hidalgo, Central Mexico), and estimated the genetic distance between
   populations on the basis of sequence variation of the mitochondria)
   genes encoding a fragment of the ND4 gene, all of tRNA-His and tRNA-Ser,
   and a fragment of tRNA-Leu. Consistent with earlier reports, males and
   females exhibited marked sexual dimorphism in body size and coloration.
   The genetic distance between the two populations was 0.024, slightly
   greater than the distance measured within each population (0.015 for La
   Manzana and 0.003 for El Enzuelado). Maximum likelihood analysis
   indicated that these populations were indeed conspecific, along with
   other studied populations of S. minor. The morphological differences and
   the previously described variation in reproductive traits contrast with
   the limited genetic variation between populations reported herein. This
   suggests that a combination of both phenotypic plasticity and genes of
   large effect may be contributing to variation in anatomical and
   physiological traits in Sceloporus minor. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {Morphometric analysis of Milla biflora (Asparagaceae:
   Brodieaoideae), with an identification key for Milla},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-86},
Abstract = {Background and aims - The taxonomical delimitation of Milla biflora has
   been controversial and is possibly associated with the high
   morphological variation of this taxon. The aims of this study were to
   find morphological characters that allow to distinguish groups among M
   biflora and to analyse the morphological variation, with the purpose of
   generating an identification key.
   Methods - A multivariate analysis was based 24 quantitative characters
   of nine species of the genus Milla. Nine morphometric characters that
   had the highest loadings in the multivariate analysis plus 18
   qualitative characters were used to run a cluster analysis.
   Key results - Discriminant analysis showed that the quantitative
   characters selected by the canonical discriminant analysis do not allow
   distinguishing all the species studied. Only the combination of
   qualitative and quantitative characters favours the separation of the
   species through the cluster analysis. Cluster analysis allowed the
   recognition of 35 groups with a dissimilarity value > 0.80. Twenty-six
   morphotypes differ from the other Milla species, previously recognized,
   in at least one character. An identification key for Milla, based on the
   diagnostic characters retrieved, distinguishes eight Milla species, as
   well as 26 morphotypes of M biflora s. str. Milla biflora s. str. can be
   identified by its fistulose leaves, a pedicel (1.5-3 cm long) lacking an
   evident articulation, white flowers that are open during the day and
   night, three tepal nerves, elliptic outer tepals, narrowly elliptic
   inner tepals with widely attenuated base, filaments less than 1 mm long
   and yellow anthers. It is geographically located south to the Mexican
   Plateau and in part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, where the type
   locality is situated.},

Abstract = {Furcraea parmentieri (Roezl ex Ortgies) Garcia-Mend. is a long-lived,
   semelparous threatened species with a restricted geographic
   distribution. We studied the demography of this species in southwest of
   Mexico City using periodic matrices. We followed the fate of 404
   individuals (in 2006-2007) and performed seed germination and seedling
   establishment experiments in the field (in 2007-2008) to estimate
   survival, growth and reproduction probabilities of individuals in eight
   size categories, according to plant height. Population structure was
   characterized by a high number of saplings, as well as medium and large
   plants. We built three annual matrices that described the demography in
   different phases of the population cycle: regular years (RG)
   characterized by low fecundity and low adult mortality; mast-seeding
   years (MS) with low seedling emergence and high adult mortality (related
   to semelparity); and post mast-seeding years (PS) with a high emergence
   of seedlings and bulbils. Periodic matrices were built simulating three
   scenarios, which consisted of mast-seeding events occurring every 5, 10,
   or 15 years. Finite population growth rates (lambda) were 1.03 (RG
   year), 0.99 (MS year), and 1.25 (PS year). The long term population
   growth rate values projected over a 90 year period (estimated on an
   annual basis) were higher as the frequency of mast-seeding events
   increased. We estimated that individuals reproduce at an age of 60-90
   years and that most new recruits originate via sexual reproduction.
   Although the population has a potential for growth, its persistence may
   be threatened due to land use change.},

Abstract = {Middle American knob-scaled lizards of the genus Xenosaurus are a unique
   radiation of viviparous species that are generally characterized by a
   flattened body shape and a crevice-dwelling ecology. Only eight species
   of Xenosaurus, one of them with five subspecies (X. grandis), have been
   formally described. However, species limits within Xenosaurus have never
   been examined using molecular data, and no complete phylogeny of the
   genus has been published. Here, we used ddRADseq data from all of the
   described and potentially undescribed taxa of Xenosaurus to investigate
   species limits, and to obtain a phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus.
   We analyzed the data using a variety of phylogenetic models, and were
   able to reconstruct a well-resolved and generally well-supported
   phylogeny for this group. We found Xenosaurus to be composed of four
   major, allopatric clades concordant with geography. The first and second
   clades that branch off the tree are distributed on the Atlantic slopes
   of the Sierra Madre Oriental and are composed of X. mendozai, X.
   platyceps, and X. newmanorum, and X. tzacualtipantecus and an
   undescribed species from Puebla, respectively. The third Glade is
   distributed from the Atlantic slopes of the Mexican Transvolcanic Belt
   in west-central Veracruz south to the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre
   del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and is composed of X. g. grandis, X.
   rectocollaris, X. phalaroanthereon, X. g. agrenon, X. penai, and four
   undescribed species from Oaxaca. The last Glade is composed of the four
   taxa that are geographically closest to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (X.
   g. arboreus, X. g. rackhami, X. g. sanmartinensis, and an undescribed
   species from Oaxaca). We also utilized a variety of molecular species
   delimitation approaches, including analyses with GMYC, PTP, BPP, and
   BFD{*}, which suggested that species diversity in Xenosaurus is at least
   30\% higher than currently estimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {A study of the correlation of lengths of words in large literary texts
   is presented. We use the statistical tools based on Allan factor and
   fractal dimension for estimating the fractal indices associated with the
   presence of correlations in the original sequences. We found that there
   is a scaling behavior at large scales for Allan factor with an exponent
   value, which reveals positive correlations. By means of the fractal
   dimension, we confirmed the presence of memory in the sequences of
   lengths of words. In addition, when considering a random rearrangement
   of the lengths of words in the original text, the fractal exponents are
   consistent with an uncorrelated process.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {17},
Pages = {2202-2208},
Abstract = {The present work aimed at evaluating the effect of four different
   mixtures of diverse volatile fatty acids (VFAs) on the viability of
   helminth ova (Ascaris suum), under mesophilic (35 degrees C) anaerobic
   conditions and at different incubation times, in order to reproduce the
   process of two-phase anaerobic digestion. The mixtures of VFAs contained
   acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and isovaleric acids, used at
   concentrations normally found in acidogenic anaerobic digesters. The
   four treatments all showed a reduction in Ascaris suum ova viability,
   among which Treatment III (4.2g-acetic acidL(-1)+2.2g-propionic
   acidL(-1)+0.6g-valeric acidL(-1)+0.6g-isovaleric acidL(-1)) resulted the
   most efficient. We found that the full effect of VFAs on the viability
   loss of Ascaris suum ova in mesophilic conditions requires a minimum
   incubation time of 3 days. The highest efficiency in the loss of
   viability was observed with Treatment III and 4-day incubation.
   Interestingly, the proportion of acetic acid was three times as much in
   this treatment than in the other ones and resulted in an effect in a
   minimum time of 3 days. The mesophilic condition, however, was not
   sufficient to induce a complete loss of viability.},

Title = {Interactions of calcium with the external surfaces of fullerenes and
   endofullerenes doped with radioactive sodium iodide},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We report first-principles calculations carried out to analyze the
   adsorption of calcium on the outer surface of the fullerene C-60,
   yielding {[}C-60 + mCa]. Geometric optimization (GO) and molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulation were performed using the plane-wave
   pseudopotential method within the framework of density functional theory
   (DFT) and timedependent DFT (TD-DFT) to investigate the configurations,
   the associated energies in the ground state, and the stabilities of
   fullerenes and endofullerenes doped with radioactive sodium iodide when
   they interact with calcium atoms on the outer fullerene surface (i.e.,
   {[}nNa(131)I@C-60 + mCa]). The reason for investigating these
   calcium-functionalized (endo) fullerene systems was to gauge their
   potential stability when used as vectors to deliver radioiodine to
   cancerous tissue in the human body. In the simulations, we found that
   the geometric limit on the number of calcium atoms that can be
   physisorbed on the outer surface of an empty fullerene while maintaining
   its structural stability is 28 calcium atoms, which also takes into
   account the proportional expansion of the fullerene as the number of
   absorbed calcium atoms increases. However, the stability of a fullerene
   system during calcium adsorption also strongly depends on whether any
   atoms or molecules are being encapsulated by the fullerene, as these
   encapsulated atoms/molecules can also interact with the fullerene and
   influence its stability. A Mulliken electronegativity analysis revealed
   that, when atoms inside and/or outside the fullerene donate charge
   (electrons) to the fullerene, the fullerene expands. The excess charge
   on the carbon atoms of the fullerene weakens some of the carbon-carbon
   bonds, potentially causing them to break, in which case the fullerene
   loses its ability to encapsulate molecules and releases them.},

Abstract = {The present work describes the chemical composition of the leaf
   essential oils from the annual plant Dalea foliolosa, which was
   collected in three consecutive years (2014-2016). The amount of
   monoterpenes (69.5-84.6\%) was higher to that of sesquiterpenes
   (10.3-22.9\%) and aliphatic hydrocarbons (1-2.1\%). Cryptone
   (22.3-30.6\%) was the most abundant oxygenated monoterpene, followed by
   linalool (10.4-17.6\%), caryophyllene oxide (4.6-15.3\%), ascaridole
   (4.5-7.4\%) and beta-citronellol (3.8-5.6\%). The hydrodistillated
   extract showed antioxidant activity against DPPH radical (IC50, 45-156
   mu g mL(-1)), strong anti-a-glucosidase activity (IC50, 14-47 mu g
   mL(-1)) and inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci
   TBR2004 (MIC, 44-105 mu g mL(-1)) and P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000
   (MIC, 35-155 mu g mL(-1)). The possible use of the essential oil as a
   novel additive for anti-hyperglycemic supplements and for the biological
   control of the analyzed Pseudomonas syringae varieties, may be
   contemplated.},

Abstract = {Tabernaemontana alba and Tabernaemontana arborea are Apocynaceae species
   used in Mexican traditional medicine for which little phytochemical
   information exists. In this study, preliminary gas chromatography/ mass
   spectrometry analyses of different organs obtained from wild plants of
   both species identified a total of 10 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids
   (MIAs) and one simple indole alkaloid, nine of which were reported for
   the first time in these species. Furthermore, callus cultures were
   established from T. alba leaf explants and regeneration of whole plants
   was accomplished via somatic embryogenesis. The anti-addictive MIAs
   ibogaine and voacangine were then quantified by gas chromatography with
   flame ionization detection in wild plants of both species, as well as
   greenhouse-grown plants, in vitro-grown plantlets and embryogenic callus
   of T. alba. Ibogaine and voacangine were present in most samples taken
   from the whole plants of both species, with stem and root barks showing
   the highest concentrations. No alkaloids were detected in callus
   samples. It was concluded that T. alba and T. arborea are potentially
   viable sources of ibogaine and voacangine, and that these MIAs can be
   produced through somatic embryogenesis and whole plant regeneration of
   T. alba. Approaches to increase MIA yields in whole plants and to
   achieve alkaloid production directly in cell cultures are discussed.},

Journal = {PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {253},
Pages = {206-214},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In plants, the cell wall is a complex and dynamic structure comprising
   high molecular weight carbohydrates and proteins. The cell wall plays an
   important role in several stages of the plant life cycle, including cell
   division, elongation and differentiation. The DUF642 family of cell wall
   proteins is highly conserved in spermatophytes and might be involved in
   pectin structural modifications. Particularly, At2g41800 is one of the
   most highly induced genes during the M/G1 phases of the cell cycle, and
   the protein encodes by this gene has been detected in cell wall
   proteomes of cell suspension cultures. In the present study, the
   expression of At2g41800 (TEB) was confirmed in primary and lateral
   roots, stigmatic papillae and hypocotyls. Subcellular localization
   studies showed that TEB is located in the cell wall. The root length and
   lateral root density were not affected in either of the two teb mutants
   studied, but the length of the hypocotyls from seedlings grown under
   light and dark conditions was increased. Immunogold labelling studies
   using JIM5 antibodies on sections of hypocotyl epidermal cells showed an
   important reduction of gold particles in teb mutants. The results
   suggested that TEB is involved in hypocotyl elongation. (C) 2016

Title = {Exploring the different facets of plant endemism in the South-Eastern
   Carpathians: a manifold approach for the determination of biotic
   elements, centres and areas of endemism},

Abstract = {In the European Alpine System, the Carpathian Mountains are recognized
   as one of the major centres of diversity and endemism. In the present
   study, we aimed to explain the spatial structure of plant endemism in
   its South-Eastern subunit by the complementary use of diversity indices,
   parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), biotic element analysis (BEA),
   and barrier analysis. We analyzed the available information on 111 plant
   taxa confined to the South-Eastern Carpathians, mapped using two
   different sets of operational geographical units (OGUs): 71
   geomorphological units and 64 quadrats. Our results showed that centres
   of endemics diversity largely corresponded to the areas of endemism and
   biotic elements. PAE consensus cladogram outlined four major areas of
   endemism (with three nested ones): (1) Danubian; (2) western part of the
   Southern Carpathians; (3) eastern part of the Southern Carpathians; and
   (4) Pocutico-Marmarossian. Out of the seven identified biotic elements,
   five were spatially clustered and overlapped the major areas of
   endemism, with one notable exception: the calcareous massifs from the
   Eastern Carpathians, not identified through PAE. Conversely, the latter
   outlined a nested area of endemism (Cozia - Buila-Vanturari?a), omitted
   by BEA. Barrier analysis identified three major breaks in the
   distribution of endemics: (1) south of the Retezat - ?arcu - Godeanu
   mountain group; (2) north of the Piatra Craiului - Bucegi - Ciucas
   mountain group; and (3) north of the Rodna massif. The results obtained
   in here using different methods are generally spatially convergent,
   indicating highly structured patterns of endemism in the South-Eastern
   Carpathians. These patterns mostly follow the present-day distribution
   of alpine habitats and calcareous bedrock, which might have acted as
   isolating factors through insularity. Interestingly, three of the
   spatial clusters of OGUs obtained from the endemics distribution
   analyses (the Eastern Carpathians, as well as eastern and western parts
   of the Southern Carpathians) largely also correspond to the mid-Miocene
   archipelago configuration of landmasses in this part of the Carpathians.
   This might suggest the existence of older migration barriers that
   emerged throughout the Neogene Period. Differences in the spatial
   patterns outlined by PAE and BEA could stem from partial sympatry of
   endemics caused by post-speciation processes such as dispersal or
   extinction. Additionally, sympatric distribution of taxa with disjunct
   populations may be caused by the absence of divergence among segregated
   populations, such as the patterns of relict distributions seen in alpine
   plants. Finally, the complementary use of these methods may prove to be
   an efficient approach for better understanding the geographical
   structure of endemism and provide a starting point for further testing
   of hypotheses on evolutionary processes.},

Abstract = {The incidence of geomagnetic storms may be associated with changes in
   circulatory physiology. The way in which the natural variations of the
   geomagnetic field due to solar activity affects the blood pressure are
   poorly understood and require further study in controlled experimental
   designs in animal models. In the present study, we tested whether the
   systolic arterial pressure (AP) in adult rats is affected by simulated
   magnetic fields resembling the natural changes of a geomagnetic storm.
   We exposed adult rats to a linear magnetic profile that simulates the
   average changes associated to some well-known geomagnetic storm phases:
   the sudden commencement and principal phase. Magnetic stimulus was
   provided by a coil inductor and regulated by a microcontroller. The
   experiments were conducted in the electromagnetically isolated
   environment of a semi-anechoic chamber. After exposure, AP was
   determined with a non-invasive method through the pulse on the rat's
   tail. Animals were used as their own control. Our results indicate that
   there was no statistically significant effect in AP when the artificial
   profile was applied, neither in the sudden commencement nor in the
   principal phases. However, during the experimental period, a natural
   geomagnetic storm occurred, and we did observe statistically significant
   AP increase during the sudden commencement phase. Furthermore, when this
   storm phase was artificially replicated with a non-linear profile, we
   noticed a 7 to 9 \% increase of the rats' AP in relation to a reference
   value. We suggested that the changes in the geomagnetic field associated
   with a geomagnetic storm in its first day could produce a measurable and
   reproducible physiological response in AP.},

Abstract = {Following World War II (WWII), there was a new emphasis within genetics
   on studying the genetic composition of populations. This probably had a
   dual source in the growing strength of evolutionary biology and the new
   international interest in understanding the effects of radiation on
   human populations, following the atomic bombings in Japan. These global
   concerns were shared by Mexican physicians. Indeed, Mexico was one of
   the leading centers of this trend in human genetics. Three leading
   players in this story were Mario Salazar Mallen, Adolfo Karl, and Ruben
   Lisker. Their trajectories and the international networks in human
   genetics that were established after WWII, paved the way for the
   establishment of medical and population genetics in Mexico. Salazar
   Mallen's studies on the distribution and characterization of ABO blood
   groups in indigenous populations were the starting point while Karl's
   studies on the distribution of abnormal hemoglobin in Mexican indigenous
   populations showed the relationships observed in other laboratories at
   the time. It was Lisker's studies, however, that were instrumental in
   the development of population genetics in the context of national public
   policies for extending health care services to the Mexican population.
   In particular, he conducted studies on Mexican indigenous groups
   contributing to the knowledge of the biological diversity of human
   populations according to international trends that focused on the
   variability of human populations in terms of genetic frequencies. From
   the start, however, Lisker was as committed to the reconstruction of
   shared languages and practices as he was to building networks of
   collaboration in order to guarantee the necessary groundwork for
   establishing the study of the genetics of human populations in Mexico.
   This study also allows us to place Mexican science within a global
   context in which connected narratives describe the interplay between
   global trends and national contexts.},

Abstract = {Permineralized infructescences are described from the Cerro del Pueblo
   Formation, Coahuila, Mexico. Morphological and anatomical observations
   of 584 infructescences support the identification and reconstruction of

   surrounded by bracts, and have a persistent style and stigma. They
   comprise a woody exocarp composed of macrosclereids, and mesocarp and
   endocarp with layers of brachysclereids. The seeds are fusiform with a
   thin seed coat. Seeds contain a distal hollow chamber, probably involved
   in dispersal, and an embryo with two cotyledons with probable helobial
   endosperm. The fruit and seed characters of the fossil do not correspond
   with an extant genus or family, thus, a new genus and species is
   proposed, Patocarpus coahuilensis gen. et sp. nov. Cevallos-Ferriz and

Abstract = {In this work, a theoretical study of the electrical properties of the
   Bi2-ySryIr2O7 (Bi(2-y)Sr(y)Ir(2)O1(6)O2) alpha-pyrochlore-type solid
   solution is presented. Quantum ab initio DFT(WIEN2k) calculations were
   performed in order to understand the electrical resistivity changes
   associated to the Bi substitution by Sr in this system. The main
   crystallographic modification associated to this substitution is the x
   position of the 48f oxygen (x, 1/8, 1/8) (O1); this substitution
   substantially modifies the Bi/Sr-O1 and Ir-O1 atomic distances,
   increasing the former and diminishing the latter. Experimentally, the
   Bi2-ySryIr2O7 samples are metallic and the electrical resistivity
   increases with the Sr content. Electronic structure calculations for
   Bi2Ir2O7 and BiSrIr2O7 show that, regardless of structural changes,
   there is only a small change of electrical conductivity with the Sr
   substitution, and the experimentally observed increase of the
   resistivity can be explained in terms of a larger impact on the
   electronic structure of both; the Sr `impurities' as well as of the
   thermal Sr oscillations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {Native to India, the ``miracle tree{''} Moringa oleifera has been a part
   of lowland tropical horticulture in Mexico for centuries, where it is
   mostly grown as an ornamental. With recent recognition of its
   nutritional, nutraceutical, and industrial properties, there is
   increasing interest in cultivating the plant beyond its current use as
   street or patio trees. Based on an extensive compilation of herbarium
   and our own field observations, we use a tool known as potential
   distribution modeling to identify the parts of the country with optimal
   climate for growing moringa. The plant grows best in areas with mean
   minimum temperatures above 15 degrees C, low rainfall below 1,000 mm,
   and at low elevations below 600 m. This combination of characteristics
   is found mostly in the dry tropical heartland of the Balsas Depression
   and the tropical Pacific coast. The states with the greatest suitable
   acreage for moringa cultivation are Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca and
   Jalisco, with nine additional states having some suitable acreage. We
   give a list of 222 Mexican counties by state with optimal climate for
   moringa cultivation and discuss strategies for cultivating the plant in
   areas with suboptimal climates. All Rights Reserved (C) 2016 Universidad

Title = {Germination of four riparian species in a disturbed semi-arid ecosystem},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {110-118},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Cuatrocienegas Valley (Coahuila, Mexico) is a highly diverse
   semiarid ecosystem. Its gypsum substrate has been altered because of the
   extensive extraction of water, resulting in the destabilization of
   underground water systems and an increasing formation of sinkholes that
   are colonized by riparian species. Sinkholes represent a set of
   microenvironments that could improve germination and seedling
   establishment of riparian species. We studied the effect of light (in
   controlled conditions: 18/32 degrees C, 12/12 h photoperiod), collection
   season (rainy and dry seasons), and time of storage on the germination,
   in field and controlled conditions, of four riparian species (Samolus
   ebracteatus var. coahuilensis, Flaveria chlorifolia, Eustoma exaltatum,
   and Sabatia tuberculata) that colonize the sinkholes. Seeds of each
   species were enclosed in permeable nylon bags and fixed to the substrate
   of randomly selected sinkholes. From September 2009 to July 2010, three
   bags per species per collection season were recovered every two months,
   and germinated seeds were counted. Recovered ungerminated and lab stored
   (control) seeds were germinated in controlled conditions. The low
   germination probabilities in the field (<0.47) contrast with the high
   probabilities (0.8) maintained by control and recovered seeds,
   regardless of the collection season or the light treatment. All the
   species showed two germination peaks in the field, coinciding with
   moisture availability. These results suggest the presence of conditional
   dormancy and the distribution of germination in time, evading the unsafe
   synchronic germination in the disturbed Cuatrocienegas environment. (C)

Abstract = {Establishing a research strategy that is suitable for undertaking
   research on software engineering is vital if we are to guarantee that
   research products are developed and validated following a systematic and
   coherent method. We took this into account as we carried out the
   COMPETISOFT research project, which investigated software process
   improvement (SPI) in the context of Latin American small companies. That
   experience has enabled us to develop a research strategy based on the
   integrated use of action research and case study methods. This paper
   introduces the proposed research strategy and provides extensive
   discussion of its application for: (1) developing the Methodological
   framework of COMPETISOFT for SPI, (2) putting this framework into
   practice in eight small software companies, and (3) refine the
   Methodological framework due to the practice feedback. The use of this
   research strategy allowed us to observe that it was suitable for
   developing, refining, improving, applying, and validating COMPETISOFT's
   Methodology framework. Furthermore, having seen it applied, we believe
   that this strategy offers a successful integration of action research
   and case study, which can be useful for conducting research in other
   software engineering areas which address needs of small software
   companies.},

Abstract = {The diversity of araneomorph spiders in an ecoturistic tropical forest
   remnant of approximately 40 ha is described. A 1-ha plot with
   homogeneous vegetation was established. Six sampling methods covered all
   microhabitats, except tree canopy. Four expeditions were conducted from
   August 2011 to June 2012. In a total of 485 samples, 4,118 adult
   specimens representing 205 morphospecies were collected. Nonparametric
   richness estimates varied between 229 and 295 species. All collected
   morphospecies and species were documented with 2,233 digital images
   available at www.unamfcaracnolab.com. These images are intended to
   expedite species identification and to allow comparisons of taxa not
   formally described. Morphospecies identifications included: 91 species,
   12 as similar to a described species, 86 to genus and 16 to family.
   Differences between seasonality and species collected revealed that
   March and June were similar in composition and were better represented
   in both number of species and adult specimens than August and November,
   although the collecting effort was the same. The similarity ranged
   between 0.35 and 0.71 among seasons. All Rights Reserved (C) 2016

Title = {Geometric integrator for simulations in the canonical ensemble},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {145},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {We introduce a geometric integrator for molecular dynamics simulations
   of physical systems in the canonical ensemble that preserves the
   invariant distribution in equations arising from the density dynamics
   algorithm, with any possible type of thermostat. Our integrator thus
   constitutes a unified framework that allows the study and comparison of
   different thermostats and of their influence on the equilibrium and
   non-equilibrium (thermo-)dynamic properties of a system. To show the
   validity and the generality of the integrator, we implement it with a
   second-order, time-reversible method and apply it to the simulation of a
   Lennard-Jones system with three different thermostats, obtaining good
   conservation of the geometrical properties and recovering the expected
   thermodynamic results. Moreover, to show the advantage of our geometric
   integrator over a non-geometric one, we compare the results with those
   obtained by using the non-geometric Gear integrator, which is frequently
   used to perform simulations in the canonical ensemble. The non-geometric
   integrator induces a drift in the invariant quantity, while our
   integrator has no such drift, thus ensuring that the system is
   effectively sampling the correct ensemble. Published by AIP Publishing.},

   model},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The sizes of paralogues-gene families produced by ancestral
   duplication-are known to follow a power-law distribution. We examine the
   size distribution of gene sets or gene families where genes are grouped
   by a similar function or share a common property. The size distribution
   of Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene sets deviate from the
   power-law, and can be fitted much better by a beta rank function. We
   propose a simple mechanism to break a power-law size distribution by a
   combination of splitting and merging operations. The largest gene sets
   are split into two to account for the subfunctional categories, and a
   small proportion of other gene sets are merged into larger sets as new
   common themes might be realized. These operations are not uncommon for a
   curator of gene sets. A simulation shows that iteration of these
   operations changes the size distribution of Ensembl paralogues and could
   lead to a distribution fitted by a rank beta function. We further
   illustrate application of beta rank function by the example of
   distribution of transcription factors and drug target genes among HGNC
   gene families.},

   51\%. The variance pointed a significance in the size of the individuals
   from the workstation Palmitas, showing the largest specimens throughout
   the study. The sediment texture in workstations La Playa and El Jardin
   was characterized by asymmetric clasts of coarse sand and gravel of
   different sizes, with a sediment layer with a depth of layer of 20-30
   cm. Unlike workstation of Palmitas wich was distinguished by almost
   symmetrical gravel clasts, similar in size and with depth of 50 cm; in
   all workstations juveniles were buried between 10 and 20 cm and adults
   between 15 and 40 cm of depth. The gonadal index was asynchronous,
   presenting the highest reproductive peaks in Palmitas. Regression Trees
   analysis established that the organic matter deposited in the sediment
   acts as the primary physicochemical variable in the distribution of the
   echinoid within the channel, locating until 6,571 individuals in direct
   relation to it. The largest number of specimens (11,330) was obtained in
   the presence of organic matter, nitrates and phosphates. This is the
   first time that genus Meoma is related to a specific substrate according
   to the body size.},

Abstract = {We studied the demography of two populations of Agave angustifolia, one
   in a preserved tropical dry forest (Xochicalco), and the other one in a
   pastureland area used for cattle grazing (Tembembe), to test whether
   populations are likely to thrive on the deteriorated habitats left after
   cattle ranching. Seed germination and seedling survival experiments were
   carried out in different natural microsites (i.e. under tree canopies
   and in open microsites). We built Lefkovitch matrices and carried out
   prospective (elasticity) and retrospective (Life Table Response
   Experiments) analyses for both populations. Numerical simulations were
   performed to project the effect of inflorescences harvest and seedling
   introduction. Seedling survival and seed germination were highest in
   Tembembe. Population growth rate was slightly higher in Tembembe (lambda
   = 1.268) than in Xochicalco (lambda = 1.208). Prospective and
   retrospective analyses showed that stasis and growth contributed most to
   population growth rate and that the differences between the two
   populations were accounted for a lower fecundity and stasis in
   Xochicalco compared to Tembembe. Simulations of inflorescence harvest
   showed that lambda dropped below unity only when all inflorescences were
   eliminated. The simulated introduction of seedlings produced a
   substantial rise in lambda. As the lambda values reflect thriving
   populations at both sites, we suggest that this species could be
   successfully used in restoration programs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the emergence of different patterns that are
   formed on both static and growing domains and their bifurcation
   structure. One of these is the so-called Turing-Hopf morphogenetic
   mechanism. The reactive part we consider is of FitzHugh-Nagumo type. The
   analysis was carried out on a flat square by considering both fixed and
   growing domain. In both scenarios, sufficient conditions on the
   parameter values are given for the formation of specific space-time
   structures or patterns. A series of numerical solutions of the
   corresponding initial and boundary value problems are obtained, and a
   comparison between the resulting patterns on the fixed domain and those
   arising when the domain grows is established. We emphasize the role of
   growth of the domain in the selection of patterns. The paper ends by
   listing some open problems in this area.},

Title = {Superfetation in live-bearing fishes is not always the result of a
   morphological constraint},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {181},
Number = {3},
Pages = {645-658},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Superfetation is an unusual reproductive strategy that consists of the
   presence of multiple broods at different developmental stages within a
   single female. One hypothesis that was proposed to explain its adaptive
   significance suggests that, in fishes, superfetation is a response to
   selective pressures that promote a thin and streamlined body shape, such
   as high-velocity water systems. Superfetation may allow for reduction in
   ovary size and hence improve streamlining because superfetating females
   carry few large, full-term embryos at any given time. We tested this
   morphological constraint hypothesis using reproductive and morphological
   data from several populations of two viviparous fishes of the family
   Poeciliidae (Poeciliopsis gracilis and Poeciliopsis infans). We found no
   evidence to support the morphological constraint hypothesis. In both
   species the degree of superfetation varied as a function of a complex
   interaction between source population and female size, and this
   interpopulation variation was not associated with the velocity of the
   water current. Contrary to what we expected, females of P. gracilis with
   more streamlined bodies were observed in rivers where water velocity is
   slow or moderate. In P. infans the velocity of the water current did not
   predict variation in body shape. Our results are noteworthy because a
   previous study which focused on a congeneric species (Poeciliopsis
   turrubarensis) demonstrated strong support for this hypothesis. However,
   based on our evidence we conclude that the association among increased
   superfetation, streamlined morphologies, and fast-flowing environments
   is not a general rule and that the adaptive value of superfetation may
   differ among species.},

Abstract = {Faunistical and ecological studies are lacking on dung beetles in the
   xerophytic scrublands at Villa de Cos, Zacatecas, of the Mexican Plateau
   Province. This study analyzed the effect of season and vegetation type
   on community structure. Pitfall traps baited with human dung were
   sampled at six sites on three dates (early rainy season, dog days, and
   late rainy season). In total, 4,040 beetles in 17 species were trapped.
   Vegetation type and sampling season affected average dung beetle
   abundance, species richness, and Simpson diversity index. Scrublands had
   more abundance and richness but least diversity than grasslands.
   Abundance diminished during dog days but richness increased during this
   season and the rains after it. Diversity had an inverse pattern with
   more during early rains than during the dog days or late rains. The
   community structure was determined by microhabitats for nesting provided
   by the combination of vegetation type and soil compaction. Telecoprids
   like Canthon humectus (Say) were dominant as predicted for Mexican arid
   zones; paracoprids were present in deeper soils and endocoprids in
   shallower soils. Abundance increased during periods of rainfall and
   diminished during dog days, which increased richness. This change
   because of vegetation and season could indicate a strategy to reduce
   interspecific competition by partial partitioning of the ecological
   niche. This was the first faunistical and ecological work and provided
   the first dung beetle records for the municipality.},

Abstract = {Six fossil associations from 59 thin sections obtained out of 23 Cipit
   boulders of the Middle-Late Triassic St. Cassian Formation are
   described. Grouping and obtainment of these associations were performed
   considering all biomorpha and microbialites contained in the thin
   sections by means of cluster analysis in Q-mode using three algorithms
   and two indices. Further microfacial categories observed in the thin
   sections were allochthonous components, cements and microsparite,
   although they do not represent a significant fraction in any case. The
   associations include the following: Dendronella-Hexactinellida
   Association, Cassianothalamia Association I, Cassianothalamia
   Association II, Patch Reef Association I (Balatonia-microencruster
   Association), Patch Reef Association II (Solenopora-Dendronella
   Association) and Patch Reef Association III (Spongiomorpha ramosa
   Association). The possible palaeoenvironmental settings, from which each
   association is derived, are discussed individually. These settings were
   elucidated based on each fossil contained in the associations, since
   many of them are diagnostic for establishing specific environmental
   criteria. Although most associations are described here for the first
   time, some of them may be related to the ``Cassian Patch Reefs'', while
   one of them ({''}Cassianothalamia-Gemeinschaft'') is reviewed.},

Abstract = {From April to December of 2010, we performed a cross sectional study in
   order to collect and identify the species of anoplurans associated with
   cricetid and heteromyd rodents from montane forests in 5 localities in
   Guerrero and Oaxaca, Mexico. We analyzed 147 rodents belonging to 10
   cricetid species and 1 heteromyd species. A total of 378 sucking lice
   were collected (189 female, 106 male 83 nymphs), distributed in 6
   species (Fahrenholzia microcephala, Hoplopleura emphereia, Hoplopleura
   ferrisi, Hoplopleura reithrodontomydis, Neohaematopinus neotomae,
   Polyplax auricularis) and 2 families (Hoplopleuridae and Polyplacidae).
   Lice specimens were processed for morphological and molecular
   identification, using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit
   I. Infestations were characterized based on the prevalence and mean
   abundance. Five of the 6 species were confirmed by molecular analysis.
   The highest levels of infestation were recorded for H. emphereia
   (66.7\%; 4.4) on Megadontomys thomasi. All localities represent new
   records for the species studied. All Rights Reserved (C) 2016

Abstract = {A study on the features of Ruppia from different sheltered bays and
   lagoons with marine or brackish water along the Mexican Yucatan
   peninsula indicates that these plants are morphologically distinct from
   the European Ruppia maritima. The Ruppia sp. from Mexico presents a more
   robust morphology, a coiled instead of straight peduncle, a slightly
   obliquely ovoid fruit instead of a pronounced asymmetrical one, and a
   chromosome number of 2n = 40 instead of 2n = 20. It is distinguished
   from the European Ruppia cirrhosa by its acute leaf tip. The diagnosis
   of Ruppia mexicana n. sp. is presented, together with data on its
   distribution in Mexico and some notes on other areas in Mexico where the
   species was found. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {AMINO ACIDS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1123-1130},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {High concentrations of proteins and amino acids can be found in
   wastewater and wastewater stream produced in anaerobic digesters, having
   shown that amino acids could persist over different managements for
   nitrogen removal affecting the nitrogen removal processes. Nitrogen
   removal is completely necessary because of their implications and the
   significant adverse environmental impact of ammonium such as
   eutrophication and toxicity to aquatic life on the receiving bodies. In
   the last decade, the treatment of effluents with high ammonium
   concentration through anammox-based bioprocesses has been enhanced
   because these biotechnologies are cheaper and more environmentally
   friendly than conventional technologies. However, it has been shown that
   the presence of important amounts of proteins and amino acids in the
   effluents seriously affects the microbial autotrophic consortia leading
   to important losses in terms of ammonium oxidation efficiency.
   Particularly the presence of sulfur amino acids such as methionine and
   cysteine has been reported to drastically decrease the autotrophic
   denitrification processes as well as affect the microbial community
   structure promoting the decline of ammonium oxidizing bacteria in favor
   of other phylotypes. In this context we discuss that new
   biotechnological processes that improve the degradation of protein and
   amino acids must be considered as a priority to increase the performance
   of the autotrophic denitrification biotechnologies.},

Title = {Phylogenomics of a rapid radiation: is chromosomal evolution linked to
   increased diversification in north american spiny lizards (Genus
   Sceloporus)?},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Background: Resolving the short phylogenetic branches that result from
   rapid evolutionary diversification often requires large numbers of loci.
   We collected targeted sequence capture data from 585 nuclear loci (541
   ultraconserved elements and 44 protein-coding genes) to estimate the
   phylogenetic relationships among iguanian lizards in the North American
   genus Sceloporus. We tested for diversification rate shifts to determine
   if rapid radiation in the genus is correlated with chromosomal
   evolution.
   Results: The phylogenomic trees that we obtained for Sceloporus using
   concatenation and coalescent-based species tree inference provide strong
   support for the monophyly and interrelationships among nearly all major
   groups. The diversification analysis supported one rate shift on the
   Sceloporus phylogeny approximately 20-25 million years ago that is
   associated with the doubling of the speciation rate from 0.06
   species/million years (Ma) to 0.15 species/Ma. The posterior probability
   for this rate shift occurring on the branch leading to the Sceloporus
   species groups exhibiting increased chromosomal diversity is high
   (posterior probability = 0.997).
   Conclusions: Despite high levels of gene tree discordance, we were able
   to estimate a phylogenomic tree for Sceloporus that solves some of the
   taxonomic problems caused by previous analyses of fewer loci. The
   taxonomic changes that we propose using this new phylogenomic tree help
   clarify the number and composition of the major species groups in the
   genus. Our study provides new evidence for a putative link between
   chromosomal evolution and the rapid divergence and radiation of
   Sceloporus across North America.},

Abstract = {The reproductive mode of the female viviparous teleost Poecilia formosa
   (Poeciliidae) represents the phenomenon known as gynogenesis; that is,
   parthenogenetic development is initiated by spermatozoa which are needed
   for physiological activation of the egg and the initiation of gestation,
   but spermatozoa are prevented from contributing to the genome of the
   embryo. For the reason that no previous histological analyses of the
   ovary of this species during the reproductive cycle has been published
   the present study has been conducted. This study examined the histology
   of the ovary of P. formosa during nongestation and gestation phases and
   identified the presence of spermatozoa inside the ovary. Spermatozoa
   were observed in folds of the ovarian epithelium of P. formosa during
   both the nongestation and gestation phases. Sperm storage as documented
   in this study is a very important trait for the gynogenetic viviparous
   fish P. formosa contributing to the understanding of this species
   reproduction. J. Morphol. 277:341-350, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

   cover, taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity) were significantly
   higher for both height categories in gap plots. Conversely, neither an
   NMDS ordination nor a multinomial classification of 187 species by
   habitat affinities revealed floristic segregation between gaps and
   non-gaps; almost all species were classified as habitat generalists,
   with only a few opportunistic forbs (but no single tree species) being
   classified as gap specialists. The most important effects of gap
   formation are significant increases in plant abundance and species
   richness, but not a different species composition. Against earlier views
   that gap-phase dynamics is inconsequential for TDF dynamics, these
   results suggest a more active, albeit modest, role of treefall gaps in
   TDF, through promoting an abundant establishment.},

Title = {Inverse estimation of integral projection model parameters using time
   series of population-level data},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-156},

Abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) allow us to describe quantitatively
   the dynamics of a population structured by a continuous variable. They
   rely on information gathered at the individual level by recording
   survival, reproduction and changes in some structuring variable over
   time. This requires the ability to track individuals over the course of
   their entire life cycle. When this is not feasible, we would like to use
   alternative information to infer a population's dynamics. Time series of
   population-level data are an option. An inverse modelling approach
   allows inferring the vital rates of a population when only
   population-level data, in the form of a time series of the size of a
   population and the distribution of its individuals along a structuring
   variable, are available. The approach also allows incorporating
   estimates obtained through individual-level data. Here, we explore how
   inverse modelling performs with simulated data and a relatively simple
   demographic model. We explore scenarios of data availability in terms of
   time-series length, per-year sample size and availability of independent
   vital-rate estimates. We also test model performance in a real system
   using a 15-year long data set from a chamaephyte plant, Cryptantha
   flava. We show that an inverse model can provide accurate
   reconstructions of the vital rates in a scenario where no
   individual-level information is available. Better results can be
   obtained if independent estimates on any vital rate are provided, as was
   the case for C.flava where high interannual variation is present.
   Parameter estimation becomes more difficult with shorter time series,
   but per-year sample size can be greatly reduced without significantly
   affecting parameter accuracy. Inverse modelling of IPMs allow for the
   estimation of unobserved vital rates, which is important for systems
   where any or all of the vital rates are hard to quantify. It also helps
   to determine whether a forward IPM is capturing the population dynamics:
   if the inverse version produces incorrect reconstructions of the vital
   rates, the forward IPM can be considered as inadequately describing the
   system.},

Abstract = {Epiphytes are a major component of tropical montane cloud forests. Over
   -exploitation and forest loss and degradation affect remnant
   populations. In this study, we analysed the population dynamics of the
   epiphytic bromeliad Tillandsia butzii over a 2-y period in a tropical
   montane cloud forest fragment in southern Mexico. Matrix analysis
   revealed that the T. butzii population is likely to be stable at the
   study site. On average the lambda value did not differ significantly
   from unity: lambda (95\% confidence interval) = 0.978 (0.936-1.001).
   lambda was highly influenced by stasis, to a lesser extent by growth and
   only slightly by fecundity. Overall, adult plant stasis and phalanx
   growth habit played a fundamental role in population maintenance. T
   butzii tolerance to xeric conditions may contribute to population
   stability in the studied region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {The effects of bath coupling on an interacting two-particle quantum
   system are studied using tools from information theory. Shannon
   entropies of the one (reduced) and two-particle distribution functions
   in position, momentum and separable phase-space are examined. Results
   show that the presence of the bath leads to a delocalization of the
   distribution functions in position space, and a localization in momentum
   space. This can be interpreted as a loss of information in position
   space and a gain of information in momentum space. The entropy sum of
   the system, in the presence of a bath, is shown to be dependent on the
   strength of the interparticle potential and also on the strength of the
   coupling to the bath. The statistical correlation between the particles,
   and its dependence on the bath and interparticle potential, is examined
   using mutual information. A stronger repulsive potential between
   particles, in the presence of the bath, yields a smaller correlation
   between the particles positions, and a larger one between their momenta.},

Abstract = {Stemflow was studied for Astrocaryum mexicanum, a palm that acts like a
   natural litter trap in the tropical rainforest at Los Tuxtlas in eastern
   Mexico. We quantified the concentration of inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-)
   and P (PO4) in the rainfall, stemflow, and throughfall in this tropical
   rainforest during the driest (March) and the wettest (September) months
   of the year, over two years. Ammonium concentrations were higher than
   NO3- in rainfall, while concentrations of NO3- and PO4 in stemflow were
   higher than those of NH4+. A significant year-pathway interaction was
   detected for NH4+ and PO4 concentrations, and the interaction of
   nutrient pathway, month and year was significant for NO3- and PO4. The
   concentration of all nutrients in rainfall, stemflow and throughfall was
   generally greater in the wet than in the dry season. The fit of the
   pairwise model was significant for rainfall-stemflow and
   rainfall-throughfall for all nutrient-pathway combinations. This allows
   us to suggest that stemflow from palm cover is an important path of N
   and P inputs to the soil in this rainforest.},

   caneyana and Orbiculoidea sp. were found in basal levels of the
   formation, in shale strata of chesterian age (Late Mississippian). The
   presence of Orbiculoidea missouriensis and Orbiculoidea capuliformis in
   upper stratigraphic levels, and also in argillaceous rocks of
   morrowan-desmoinesian age (Middle Pennsylvanian), corroborate the age of
   the fossil-bearing rocks. These are the first records of Orbiculoidea
   caneyana and O. capuliformis in Mexico and, along with O. missouriensis,
   highlight the paleobiogeographic relationship of the carboniferous
   faunas of Nochixtlan with coeval faunas described in the east-central
   region of the United States.},

Title = {Biases, gaps, and opportunities in mammalian extinction risk research},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. A subdiscipline of conservation science involves the study of
   differences between threatened and non-threatened species. The relevance
   of multispecies analyses of extinction risk to conservation practice has
   been questioned, but there has been no synthesis of the allocation of
   research effort to different regions and groups of mammals to assess
   whether or not sufficient knowledge is available to support conservation
   science where it is most needed.
   2. I reviewed 68 comparative studies of mammalian extinction risk to
   test whether existing research reflects our concern for threatened
   species. Additionally, I examined the variables used and various
   methodological issues that can lead to uninformative results.
   3. Known spatial and taxonomic biases in conservation science persisted
   in extinction risk research, leaving large proportions of globally
   threatened taxa unstudied. Primates and carnivores had more dedicated
   studies, whereas small mammals such as rodents and the Eulipotyphla
   (true shrews, talpids, solenodons, gymnures, and hedgehogs) lack
   research effort despite their high diversity, threat, and extinction
   record. Except for the Australian mammal fauna (a clear priority given
   the number of threatened, extinct, and endemic taxa), most areas of
   conservation importance remain underrepresented in these types of
   studies.
   4. Detailed country-level analyses can provide applicable results for
   understudied regions. I propose Southeast Asia and the Caribbean for
   further research, given their high levels of extinction, threat and
   endemism, and their unique biogeographic histories. Finally, I offer
   suggestions for general methodological improvements to avoid problems
   with missing data and statistical circularity in order to maximise
   conservation relevance.},

Abstract = {In this work we present a programming philosophy and a template code for
   achieving computational scalability when using multiple graphics
   processing units (GPUs) in the numerical solution of any mathematical
   system of equations found in continuum dynamic simulations. The
   programming philosophy exploits the principal characteristics of the GPU
   hardware, with emphasis in the delivering of threads with massive memory
   fetches, intense calculations using local registers and limited writes
   to global memory. The philosophy requires explicit formulas for
   calculations for which domain decomposition is trivial. The domains are
   decomposed in regions that use the local central processing unit (CPU)
   to communicate common interfaces using the message passing interface
   (MPI). A template code for the heat equation is established and tested
   for scalability. The novelty is that we show a series of codes,
   constructed from the basic template, that solve all the basic model
   equations found in continuum dynamics, and present illustrative results.
   The model equations are the heat equation, the Poisson equation, the
   shallow-water equations, the flow in porous media equations and the
   vorticity equations.},

Abstract = {T-wave alternans in the ECG are related to discordant alternans (DA) in
   the cardiac action potential. T-wave alternans have been associated with
   block in the electrical activity of the heart, induction of reentry and
   to ventricular arrhythmias. The hypothesis of this study is that
   discordant alternans can be initiated in a simulated one dimensional
   cable of heart tissue during ischemia. The effect of ischemia was model
   by raising the external potassium concentration {[}K+](o) in strips of
   ventricular cardiac tissue modeled with the Lou Rudy 1 model. {[}K+](o)
   increases from 5.00 up to 12.00 mM. To search for the DA, the
   stimulation period (T) varied from 250 ms up to 500 ms. DA were
   generated in the cables, they appeared at short T during ischemia. After
   analyzing the dynamics of the electrical propagation patterns for each
   {[}K+](o) and T, five types of patterns were found in the cables. The
   most common pattern was regular propagation, in second place are the
   concordant alternans at high degrees of ischemia, in between these two
   the DA occur, transient states and finally the patterns with irregular
   propagation. We have shown that DA can occur in cardiac tissue with
   ischemia just as in healthy tissue. Also, the DA formed in the cables of
   ischemic heart tissue present one or multiply nodes.},

Abstract = {Coniferous plantations have been widely used by reforestation programs
   seeking to mitigate the effects of deforestation in mountainous areas in
   different parts of the world. However, some studies show that pine
   plantations can simulate natural mechanisms of succession, thereby
   facilitating the incorporation of other native species of mid- and
   late-successional stages. Existing pine plantations could function as a
   substitute habitat and facilitate the establishment of native and
   endangered cloud forest species. To test this hypothesis, we planted two
   endangered species from the family Juglandaceae (Juglans pyriformis and
   Oreomunnea mexicana) under twelve-year-old canopy plantations of Pinus
   patula and compared them to individuals planted in open (control) sites
   and recorded their survival and growth. The results show that the
   survival of J. pyriformis and O. mexicana was significantly higher below
   the canopy of P. patula plantations than in the open site. However,
   growth rates varied significantly among species and sites. Although pine
   plantations may favor the survival of seedlings, they cannot ensure the
   growth of plants without additional forest management.},

Title = {SOME RESULTS ON WEAKLY PSEUDOCOMPACT SPACES},
Journal = {HOUSTON JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS},

Pages = {1345-1366},
Abstract = {A space X is weakly pseudocompact if it is G(delta)-dense in at least
   one of its compactifications. A compact space K in which X is densely
   embedded is called a simple compactification of X if K is the quotient
   space obtained by identifying a compact subset of beta X
   \textbackslash{} X to one point. A space X is simple pseudocompact if it
   is a G(delta)-dense subspace in one of its simple com-pactifications. In
   this article we improve several results about weakly pseu-docompact
   spaces obtained by F. W. Eckertson and by S. Garcia-Ferreira and A.
   Garcia-Maynez. The main theorem characterizes weakly pseudocom-pact
   spaces as those spaces whose ring C{*} (X) contains a regular subring Q
   such that if f is an element of Q and Z(f) = phi, then 1/f is an element
   of Q. Furthermore, we prove: (1) if X is locally pseudocompact, then X
   is weakly pseudocompact if and only if X is either compact or is not
   Lindelof; (2) the simple pseudocompact spaces is the class constituted
   by compact and locally pseudocompact non-Lindelof spaces; (3) the
   property of being a simple pseudocompact space is preserved by the
   images of perfect functions and the inverse images of open perfect
   functions; (4) if the product of a space X with a compact space is
   weakly pseudocompact then X is weakly pseudocompact.},

Title = {Molecular Survey of Bartonella Species and Yersinia pestis

Abstract = {Rodent fleas from northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico, were analyzed for the
   presence of Bartonella and Yersinia pestis. In total, 760 fleas
   belonging to 10 species were tested with multiplex polymerase chain
   reaction analysis targeting the gltA (338-bp) and pla genes (478-bp) of
   Bartonella and Y. pestis, respectively. Although none was positive for
   Y. pestis, 307 fleas were infected with Bartonella spp., resulting in an
   overall prevalence of 40.4\%. A logistic regression analysis indicated
   that the presence of Bartonella is more likely to occur in some flea
   species. From a subset of Bartonella-positive fleas, phylogenetic
   analyses of gltA gene sequences revealed 13 genetic variants clustering
   in five phylogroups (I-V), two of which were matched with known
   pathogenic Bartonella species (Bartonella vinsonii subsp. arupensis and
   Bartonella washoensis) and two that were not related with any previously
   described species or subspecies of Bartonella. Variants in phylogroup V,
   which were mainly obtained from Meringis spp. fleas, were identical to
   those reported recently in their specific rodent hosts (Dipodomys spp.)
   in the same region, suggesting that kangaroo rats and their fleas harbor
   other Bartonella species not reported previously. Considering the
   Bartonella prevalence and the flea genotypes associated with known
   pathogenic Bartonella species, we suggest that analysis of rodent and
   flea communities in the region should continue for their potential
   implications for human health. Given that nearby locations in the United
   States have reported Y. pestis in wild animals and their fleas, we
   suggest conducting larger-scale studies to increase our knowledge of
   this bacterium.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {834-841},
Abstract = {Larvae, nymphs and adults of the cave dwelling tick Ornithodoros dyeri,
   collected in 3 Mexican states, were studied using morphological and
   molecular methods. The adults and nymphs were characterized by an
   elongated body in proportion to the width and a dorsum bounded by two
   contiguous ridges and one third ridge (inner) that was incomplete on
   each side. The larvae of this species have 14 pairs of dorsal setae, a
   venter body with nine pairs of setae plus a posteromedian; a moderately
   large, dorsal plate and piriform, a hypostome arising from a relatively
   short, subtriangular median extension of the basis capituli, and a
   capsule of Halleris organ with reticulations. Based on a maximum
   likelihood analysis of the sequences of a fragment of approximately 414
   by of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, we showed that O. dyeri
   represents an independent lineage within neotropical species of the
   Argasidae. The bat species Mimon cozumelae and Peropteryx macrotis
   represents a new host record for this argasid. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Title = {A Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis for the Southern Chilean
   Demersal Fishery},
Journal = {MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {350-360},
Abstract = {A multispecies virtual population analysis (MSVPA) model for the
   southern Chilean demersal fishery was developed. Species included the
   Southern Hake Merluccius australis, Pink Cusk-eel Genypterus blacodes
   (hereafter, ``Kingklip{''}), Southern Blue Whiting (SBW) Micromesistius
   australis, and Patagonian Grenadier (also known as Argentine Straptail)
   Macruronus magellanicus (hereafter, ``Hoki{''}). Due to a lack of
   stomach content data, we constructed suitability coefficients based on
   predator-prey size ratios. Terminal fishing mortality (Fterm) was
   estimated by fitting a cohort analysis model to estimates of abundance
   from single-species models developed by the Chilean Instituto de Fomento
   Pesquero (IFOP; Institute for Fishing Development). Values of Fterm were
   used as input data in the MSVPA, driving the dynamics of the species and
   producing adult abundance estimates that were similar to IFOP estimates.
   Comparison of MSVPA and IFOP estimates suggested consistency in adult
   abundance and total abundance estimates for SBW. Differences were
   identified for adult Hoki abundance estimates. Differences in
   recruitment estimates were small for SBW, whereas greater differences
   were found for Hoki. The MSVPA revealed high estimates of predation
   mortality for Hoki, while predation played a minor role in SBW
   population dynamics. Cannibalism and predation by Southern Hake were the
   main components of predation mortality for age-0 Hoki; Southern Hake
   were the most important source of predation for age-1 Hoki. Sensitivity
   analysis suggested that Hoki response variables were sensitive to 10\%
   perturbations in suitability coefficients, while SBW response variables
   were not. This study is a first step toward building a multispecies
   framework that could provide complementary information for the
   sustainable management of fishing resources in southern Chile.},

Title = {Relationship between Oxidative Stress, Circadian Rhythms, and AMD},
Journal = {OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {This work reviews concepts regarding oxidative stress and the mechanisms
   by which endogenous and exogenous factors produce reactive oxygen
   species (ROS). It also surveys the relationships between oxidative
   stress, circadian rhythms, and retinal damage in humans, particularly
   those related to light and photodamage. In the first section, the
   production of ROS by different cell organelles and biomolecules and the
   antioxidant mechanisms that antagonize this damage are reviewed. The
   second section includes a brief review of circadian clocks and their
   relationship with the cellular redox state. In the third part of this
   work, the relationship between retinal damage and ROS is described. The
   last part of this work focuses on retinal degenerative pathology,
   age-related macular degeneration, and the relationships between this
   pathology, ROS, and light. Finally, the possible interactions between
   the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), circadian rhythms, and this
   pathology are discussed.},

   which generates secondary shock waves and the emission of microjets of
   fluid. Cavitation has been recognized as a significant phenomenon that
   produces both desirable and undesirable biomedical effects. Several
   studies have shown that cavitation can be controlled by emitting two
   shock waves that can be delayed by tenths or hundreds of microseconds.
   These dual-pulse pressure pulses, which are known as tandem shock waves,
   have been shown to enhance in vitro and in vivo urinary stone
   fragmentation, cause significant cytotoxic effects in tumor cells, delay
   tumor growth, enhance the bactericidal effect of shock waves and
   significantly increase the efficiency of genetic transformations in
   bacteria and fungi. This article provides an overview of the basic
   physical principles, methodologies, achievements and potential uses of
   tandem shock waves to improve biomedical applications.},

Abstract = {Restoration requires techniques similar to those used in agriculture to
   improve germination and seedling vigor. We treated 6-year-old (collected
   in 2003, S-2003) and 1-month-old (S-2009) seeds of Dodonaea viscosa with
   hydropriming (HP). Seeds were made permeable with hot water prior to
   hydration for 24 or 48 hours (HP-24 and HP-48, respectively) followed by
   dehydration. The resulting seedlings exposed to both HP treatments were
   sown in a lava field in soil mixed with hydrogel (HG) under the shade
   projected by five vegetation patches. The effects of these treatments on
   germination, seedling field survival, and growth were assessed. HP-24 in
   S-2009 and HP-48 in S-2003 increased the germination percentage from
   22.5 and 31.7\% in control seeds (permeable seeds) to 63.3 and 98.3\%,
   respectively. The seedlings-2009 (from S-2009) with HG maintained high
   survival in all vegetation patches. Seedlings-2003, however, had low
   survival. The lack of HG was negatively related to the photon flux in
   each patch. Survival of seedlings-2009 increased with HG of up to 398.41
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1); after which survival decreased. During the rainy
   season, HP enhanced seedling growth, except the basal diameters and
   number of leaves in the seedlings-2003 with HP-24. During the dry
   season, the effects of HG and HP were similar for all the seedlings. In
   the following rainy season, the priming effect was lost while HG
   continued to promote seedling growth. The combined use of HP and HG and
   the shade projected by the patches resulted in a successful vegetation
   recovery strategy.},

   the following: (1) if C-p(X, 2) is Rothberger, then X is pseudocompact;
   (2) for every pseudocompact Sokolov space X with t{*} (X) <= omega,
   C-p(X, 2) is Rothberger; and (3) assuming CH (the continuum hypothesis)
   there is a maximal almost disjoint family A for which the space C-p

Abstract = {A space X is weakly pseudocompact if it is G(delta)-dense in at least
   one of its compactifications. X has property D-Y if for every countable
   discrete and closed subset N of X, every function f : N -> Y can be
   continuously extended to a function over all of X. O-pseudocompleteness
   is the pseudocompleteness property defined by J.C. Oxtoby {[}17], and
   T-pseudocompleteness is the pseudocompleteness property defined by A.R.
   Todd {[}24].
   In this paper we analyze when a space of continuous functions C-p(X, Y)
   is weakly pseudocompact where X and Y are such that C-p(X, Y) is dense
   in Y-x. We prove: (1) For spaces X and Y such that X has property D-Y
   and Y is first countable weakly pseudocompact and not countably compact,
   the following conditions are equivalent: (i) C-p(X, Y) is weakly
   pseudocompact, (ii) C-p(X, Y) is O-pseudocomplete, and (iii) C-p(X,Y) is
   T-pseudocomplete. (2) For a space X and a compact metrizable topological
   group G such that X has property D-G, the following statements are
   equivalent: (i) C-p(X,G) is pseudocompact, (ii) C-p(X, G) is weakly
   pseudocompact, (iii) C-p(X,G) is T-pseudocomplete, and (iv) CpX,G) is
   O-pseudocomplete. (3) For every space X, C-p{*},(X) and C-p{*} (X,Z) are
   not weakly pseudocompact. Throughout this study we also consider several

Title = {Have superfetation and matrotrophy facilitated the evolution of larger
   offspring in poeciliid fishes?},

Abstract = {Superfetation is the ability of females to simultaneously carry multiple
   broods of embryos, with each brood at a different developmental stage.
   Matrotrophy is the post-fertilization maternal provisioning of nutrients
   to developing embryos throughout gestation. Several studies have
   demonstrated that, in viviparous fishes, superfetation and matrotrophy
   have evolved in a correlated way, such that species capable of bearing
   several simultaneous broods also exhibit advanced degrees of
   post-fertilization provisioning. The adaptive value of the concurrent
   presence of both reproductive modes may be associated with the
   production of larger newborns, which in turn may result in enhanced
   offspring fitness. In this study, we tested two hypotheses: (1) species
   with superfetation and moderate or extensive matrotrophy give birth to
   larger offspring compared with species without superfetation or
   matrotrophy; (2) species with higher degrees of superfetation and
   matrotrophy (i.e. more simultaneous broods and increased amounts of
   post-fertilization provisioning) give birth to larger offspring compared
   with species with relatively low degrees of superfetation and
   matrotrophy (i.e. fewer simultaneous broods and lesser amounts of
   post-fertilization provisioning). Using different phylogenetic
   comparative methods and data on 44 species of viviparous fishes of the
   family Poeciliidae, we found a lack of association between offspring
   size and the combination of superfetation and matrotrophy. Therefore,
   the concurrent presence of superfetation and moderate or extensive
   matrotrophy has not facilitated the evolution of larger offspring. In
   fact, these traits have evolved differently. Superfetation and
   matrotrophy have accumulated gradual changes that largely can be
   explained by Brownian motion, whereas offspring size has evolved
   fluidly, experiencing changes that probably resulted from selective
   responses to the local conditions. (C) 2015 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {Study of bioerosion traces in the geologic record of rocky shores is can
   establish the location of ancient shorelines and aid understanding of
   the evolution of marine communities in marginal environments. As an
   example, the ichnologic record associated with cobbles of the
   conglomerate that crops out along the east side of Neovolcanic Ridge,
   near Plan del Rio village in Veracruz State, south-central Mexico is
   described and explained. The conglomerate corresponds to the upper part
   of the Concepcion Formation, deposited during the Miocene. The bivalves
   and gastropods included in the sandy matrix, and the presence of oysters
   and bryozoans on the surfaces of clasts, allowed interpretation of this
   conglomerate as an ancient rocky shore. The present work deals with
   bioerosion recorded in the clasts. Six ichnogenera and ten ichnospecies
   were determined, corresponding to the activity of polychaetes and/or
   sipunculids (Caulostrepsis taeniola, Maeandropolydora sulcans and
   Trypanites weisei), echinoids (Circolites isp.), clionaid sponges
   (Entobia cateniformis, E. geometrica and E. ovula), and boring bivalves
   (Gastrochaenolites cluniformis, G. lapidicus and G. torpedo). The
   relative abundance of boring organisms allows these biota to be placed
   within the Entobia ichnofacies, which is characteristic of hard
   substrates with deep bioerosion. The abundance and diversity of
   Gastrochaenolites and Entobia in the ichnoassociations studied indicate
   a shallow marine environment with a low sedimentation rate, including
   episodes of removal or rolling of clasts. This process is inferred from
   clast roundness and the presence of bioerosion traces on most clast
   surfaces. On the other hand, the presence of complete and eroded
   Gastrochaenolites borings in the same clast shows different episodes of
   bioerosion. Results of this work allow for an understanding of the
   genetic history of the conglomerate, confirming its deposition in a
   rocky shore palaeoenvironment and indicating the location of an ancient
   shoreline on the west margin of the Gulf of Mexico during the Miocene.

Title = {Rindler approximation to Kerr-Newman black hole},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {130},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {We show that the Rindler approximation to the time-radial part of the
   Kerr and Kerr-Newman metrics near their external h(+) and internal h(-)
   horizons only holds outside h(+) and inside h(-), so respectively inside
   and outside the external and internal ergospheres, regions where, in
   Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, both g(tt) and g(rr) are negative, but
   preserving the Lorentzian character of the metric, and r > 0 i.e.
   outside the region r < 0 where closed timelike curves exist. At each
   point, the choice of Rindler coordinates is not trivial, but depends on
   the polar angle theta. The approximation, as is known, automatically
   gives the absolute values of the surface gravities kappa(+/-) as the
   corresponding proper accelerations, and therefore the Hawking
   temperatures tau(+/-) at h(+/-).},

Abstract = {A database with all available published accounts of the ciliate parasite
   species of Mexican fishes was assembled. This information, along with
   records derived from own recent research, allow generating a checklist

   future questions in the areas of ecology, evolutionary biology and
   biogeography of these host-parasite associations. The checklist is
   presented as a parasite-host list, and a host-parasite list. The
   checklist contains 30 nominal species, from 9 genera and 8 families of
   ciliate parasites. Most of the primary records were done for exotic fish
   species, artificially introduced to Mexico for aquaculture purposes;
   however, recent works have been conducted in diverse species of native
   fishes. Excepting one, all the ciliate species listed here have been
   previously recorded for diverse fish species from different localities
   around the world. Based on the amount of information contained in this
   checklist, much more effort is necessary to accurately know the
   diversity of species of this type of parasites in fish fauna of Mexico.},

Abstract = {The Atoms for Peace initiative was announced by U.S. President Dwight D.
   Eisenhower in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 8
   December 1953. The ways in which Eisenhower's proposal was interpreted,
   adapted and reshaped by different countries allows us to understand the
   various meanings and uses of nuclear technologies, particularly in Third
   World countries. Mexico's version of the initiative was related to its
   modernizing nationalism, a distaste for overt geopolitical alignment and
   nuclear weapons, and an intermittent commitment of the federal
   government with nuclear technologies. These ingredients eventually led
   to the promotion of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
   Latin America and the Caribbean, known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco (TT)
   signed in Mexico City in 1967. The TT made Latin America the first
   nuclear weapons-free populated region in the world, thus positioning
   Mexico in the new geopolitical nuclear order through a denuclearization
   discourse and a policy of non-engagement with nuclear technologies.},

Title = {Co-existence in a species-rich grassland: competition, facilitation and
   niche structure over a soil depth gradient},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {674-685},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {QuestionNiche differentiation may promote species co-existence because
   it precludes competitive exclusion. However, in stressful environments,
   facilitation may predominate, and large niche overlaps may result from
   niche widening and positive spatial associations. We analysed the niche
   structure of a species-rich system over a soil depth gradient (a niche
   axis positively correlated with water availability) and tested for
   various patterns expected from competition or facilitation.
   LocationSemi-arid grassland, Oaxaca, Mexico.
   MethodsWe recorded species abundance and soil depth in 1200 0.1x0.1m
   quadrats from four sites. Community structure was described through
   correspondence analysis and correlated with soil depth. We measured
   niche breadth (Levine's index), position (mean depth) and overlap
   (Hurlbert's index). We used a null model to estimate the expected
   overlap if interactions play no role in determining community structure.
   We tested whether overlap changed along the depth gradient. We also
   analysed if niches become narrow with higher competition.
   ResultsData supported three predictions derived from competition: most
   species' niches were relatively narrow and differed in their position
   along the gradient, a pattern reflected in a changing community
   structure; realized niches became narrower where competition was
   stronger; and niche overlap was smaller than expected by chance.
   Facilitation had no support: large niche overlaps expected from stress
   amelioration were as frequent as predicted by chance. Overlap increased
   in the most stressful (shallow) soils, as expected if facilitation
   predominates there, but also in the deepest ones where evidence for
   competition was strong, suggesting an artifact at the extremes of the
   gradient.
   ConclusionsIn this grassland, competition seems to restrict species
   distribution, abating richness in the deepest soils and relegating poor
   competitors (succulent and poikilohydric species) to the shallow soils.
   There, drought tolerance rather than facilitation determined community
   composition and richness. Our results support the idea that hydrological
   niches play an important role in maintaining plant diversity because (1)
   differentiation in hydrological requirements (small niche overlaps over
   the water-use axis) reduces competition, and (2) spatial heterogeneity
   and stress create competition-free patches. Our results also support the
   hypothesis that facilitation is rare when stress is caused by resource
   (in this case, water) scarcity.},

Abstract = {The effect of arthropod presence and litter accumulation on the
   vegetative growth of the vascular epiphytes, on the leaves growth
   pattern in Tillandsia violacea was conducted in an Abies-Quercus
   temperate forest in Central Mexico. The leave production was recorded
   every month for one year in 40 relatively small plants of T. violacea
   (<20 cm at the base of the rosette) revealing that in plants with litter
   and arthropods accumulation, there is an oscillatory period of 9.6787
   month in the leaves production whereas when arthropod presence and
   litter accumulation are restricted, the oscillatory period is lost
   showing an irregular growth pattern. These results suggest the
   importance of arthropods and litter accumulation on the development of
   the epiphytic plants.},

Abstract = {The fauna of the echinoderms of Mexico is represented by 643 species.
   Within these, 113 belong to the class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers). The
   phyllophorids (Holothuroidea: Phyllophoridae) are characterized by the
   presence of more than 10 tentacles and a calcareous ring prolonged
   posteriorly with small pieces forming a mosaic-like appearance. Their
   cryptic habits have made them difficult to record during the many years
   of taxonomic studies regarding this group in Mexico. This paper aims to
   raise awareness of the state of knowledge on the diversity of the
   Phyllophoridae family in Mexican territorial waters. We present 16
   species belonging to six genera, living in shallow (0 - 200 m) to deep
   (>200 m) waters in the Mexican Pacific, Gulf of California, Mexican
   Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Within these, three new records are
   included. A taxonomic identification catalog was obtained for each
   species, providing information about external and internal morphology;
   the material was examined and recorded with information from type
   material and locality, all previous reports for Mexico, the geographic
   and bathymetric distribution as well as photographs taken with Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the shape and combination of the spicules.
   The work is complemented with a dichotomous key for identification.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In most places all over the world -including our
   country-services in emergency rooms are oversaturated. This situation
   frequently forces the continuously arriving ambulances to be redirected
   to other medical units, delaying the admission of patients moved and
   thus adversely affecting their physical condition. Objective: To
   introduce an improvement to the Indice de Saturacion Modificado
   computational system, which monitors the degree of saturation of a
   network of emergency medical services, to include a network of
   ambulances, enabling in the system: (i) the effective allocation of
   ambulances to the site of the accident, or severe clinical event, and
   (ii) the remote booking of beds in the nearest and least saturated
   emergency room available. Material and Methods: The evaluation and
   connectivity of the computational improvement to the Indice de
   Saturacicn Modificado system was carried out with a computational test
   verifying these two aspects, using only differences in postal codes, for
   time measuring. Results: The verification of its sustainability online
   showed the new Indice de Saturacion Modificado y Ambulancias system
   (ISMA) has a robust structure capable of being adapted to mobile phones,
   laptops or tablets, and can efficiently administrate: (i) the
   quantification of excessive demand in the emergency room services of a
   hospital network, (ii) the allocation of ambulances attending the site
   of the event or contingency, and (iii) the allocation of ambulances and
   patients, in the best distance-time conditions, from the site of the
   accident or clinical event to the nearest and least saturated emergency
   room service. Conclusions: This administrative management tool is
   efficient and simple to use, and it optimally relates independent
   service networks.},

   film, deposited by sputtering onto a glass slide using a low-cost
   homemade, near-infrared pulsed laser platform. A 785 nm laser diode of a
   CDDVD pickup head was precisely focused on the sample mounted on a
   motorized two-axis translation stage to generate localized surface
   microbumps on the bismuth films. This simple method successfully
   transferred desired micropatterns on the films in a computer-numerical
   control fashion. Irradiated zones were characterized by atomic force
   microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that final
   results are strongly dependent on irradiation parameters. (C) 2014

Abstract = {We performed DFT calculations (with long-range corrected hybrid density
   functional wB97XD in 6-31G(d, 2p) Gaussian basis set) for the
   interaction of free porphine ligand and a number of its metal complexes
   with C-60 molecule. Its complexation mechanism was analized with the
   help of Hirshfeld, Mulliken and Bader's QTAIM analysis. We found that a
   selected DFT functional perfectly describes the intermolecular distances
   and leads to satisfactory formation energies. Population analysis
   indicated the presence of fullerene polarization in the field of
   metalloporphyrin in all complexes considered. The fullerene complexes
   with MnP and FeP showed a considerable basic state charge transfer of
   0.4e and 0.3e, respectively. Topological analysis of the electron
   density confirmed presence of the van der Weals interactions and
   revealed the presence of strong transit close shell interactions in
   MnP-, FeP- and CoP-complexes, supporting their high formation energies.},

Abstract = {Thelephora is a genus of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes with basidiomes
   of varied shape which has been poorly studied in tropical ecosystems. In
   this paper, we present Thelephora versatilis and Thelephora
   pseudoversatilis, two new species collected in the same localities of
   deciduous and sub-perennial tropical forests of Jalisco, Mexico.
   Basidiomes of both species are brownish gray to violet brown with
   clavarioid-mesopodal, sub-resupinate or completely resupinate growth
   forms. In turn, phylogenetic analyses using nrDNA ITS sequences showed
   that these species are not closed related, nevertheless they are part of
   a well-supported clade conformed by several species of Thelephora,
   Tomentella and some undescribed Thelephorales. Morphological segregation
   of these species was attained by analyzing spore and hyphae characters
   using a wide sample. Significant statistical differences between the new
   species were observed regarding spore size, spine size and context
   hyphae width. This work exemplifies the relevance of integrating both
   morphological and molecular data, as well of the use of an appropriate
   sample size in order to discriminate among morphological cryptic
   species.},

Title = {Ecology, conservation and human history of marine mammals in the Gulf of
   California and Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {In total, 43 marine mammal species, eight of which are threatened,
   inhabit the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Baja California. The
   unique attributes of marine mammal fauna such as species richness, risk
   condition, energy consumption and calving in this region are
   historically and geographically important. Marine mammals in the Baja
   California seas have been hunted for the past 10,000 years and they are
   also currently subject to severe anthropogenic impacts. Commercial
   hunting started in the late 18th century and some populations declined
   until the 1970s. Anthropogenic impacts on marine mammals diversified
   during the 20th century, with fisheries and pollution now being their
   greatest threats. Currently, the coasts surrounding Baja California seas
   are home to 3.06\% of Mexican people and 1.77\% live in relation with
   maritime activities. This is a relatively small population that has been
   growing since the Spanish conquest in the 16th century together with
   decimation of the regional indigenous populations. The scarce people
   around Baja California seas have important contributions to Mexican
   economy and marine disturbance, mostly because the arid environments of
   northwestern Mexico have historically encouraged marine fisheries as the
   major intake of natural living resources in the region. Therefore, the
   region's environmental problems do not stem from an overpopulation
   requiring ecosystem services, with the exception that exhaustion of the
   underground aquifers is of great concern, but from historical Problems
   related with social and economic development. Conservation of marine
   mammals in the Baja California seas may be helpful to geographically and
   socially integrate human development and ecosystem protection, to
   address current problems of illegality, sectorial conflicts and
   partiality in conservation actions as well as to monitor the
   modifications and functionality of the marine ecosystem. (C) 2014

Abstract = {It is well known that long-term exposure to high levels of pollution is
   hazardous to human health. Therefore, it is important to study and
   understand the behavior of pollutants in general. In this work, we study
   the occurrence of a pollutant concentration's surpassing a given
   threshold (an exceedance) as well as the length of time that the
   concentration stays above it. A general N(t)/D/1 queueing model is
   considered to jointly analyze those problems. A non-homogeneous Poisson
   process is used to model the arrivals of clusters of exceedances.
   Geometric and generalized negative binomial distributions are used to
   model the amount of time (cluster size) that the pollutant concentration
   stays above the threshold. A mixture model is also used for the cluster
   size distribution. The rate function of the non-homogeneous Poisson
   process is assumed to be of either the Weibull or the Musa-Okumoto type.
   The selection of the model that best fits the data is performed using
   the Bayes discrimination method and the sum of absolute differences as
   well as using a graphical criterion. Results are applied to the daily
   maximum ozone measurements provided by the monitoring network of the
   Metropolitan Area of Mexico City.},

Title = {Hydrological evaluation of a peri-urban stream and its impact on
   ecosystem services potential},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {628-644},

Abstract = {Rivers are aquatic systems with a unidirectional flow. These systems are
   highly diverse habitats that support a great variety of organisms, which
   vary in shape and function, and sustain a diverse range of hydrological
   ecosystem services (HESs). The HESs provided by rivers varies based on
   complex hydro-geomorphological dynamics and their relationship with the
   functional processes of the basin. Land use changes in transition zones,
   where ecosystem functions are compromised, affect the basin, especially
   basins close to or on the periphery of urban areas. Such is the case for
   Mexico City, where 60 m(3) of water is consumed per second, 30\% of
   which is imported from outside sources.
   The rivers of the Magdalena-Eslava sub-basin are among the few remaining
   surficial water sources in Mexico City. These rivers are located in an
   area classified as a Soil Conservation Zone, which has been intensely
   managed for decades. The aims of this paper are (1) to perform a
   hydrological evaluation of two urban streams and identify their
   relationship with the provision of hydrological ecosystem services via
   (i) a hydraulic balance analysis, (ii) a hydro-geomorphological
   characterization of each stream, (iii) an estimate of present and
   potential hydraulic erosion, (iv) the determination of physicochemical
   and bacteriological parameters and (v) a description of
   macroinvertebrates, macroalgae and their habitats in order to (2)
   identify the impacts of socio-economic dynamics on the responses of this
   rural-urban lotic system. Our results show that water flow, forest cover
   and hydro-geomorphologic heterogeneity are key to sustaining ecosystem
   functioning, especially in the high and middle sections of the basin.
   The highest potential provision of water for direct use was recorded in
   the sub-basin's middle section; however, the stream channels in that
   section have lost their natural water flow due to a water management
   infrastructure built to regulate flow during the rainy season. This
   intervention can be viewed as a regulation of HESs as water management
   infrastructure alters the transport of sediment and reduces available
   natural habitat. The provision of quality water in the lower area of the
   sub-basin has been seriously compromised by the establishment of illegal
   urban settlements. A relationship between biologically diverse
   ecological traits and their response capabilities was established and
   can be considered an indicator of current HES potential. Therefore, this
   sub-basin may constitute an example of good management and maximizing
   potential HESs in an urban-rural setting based on improved management
   strategies that could be applied in other developing nations. (C) 2015

Title = {Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) shows circadian oscillations in
   crayfish Procambarus clarkii putative pacemakers},
Journal = {CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {1135-1144},
Abstract = {Although several studies of glia have examined glial fibrillary acid
   protein (GFAP) and its relationship to the circadian rhythms of
   different organisms, they have not explored the daily GFAP oscillations
   in the putative pacemakers of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii or in
   other crustaceans. In this study we investigated the daily variations in
   GFAP concentrations in the eyestalk and brain, which are considered to
   be putative pacemakers in adult P. clarkii. In both structures, the
   glial GFAP was quantified using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA), and double labeling immunofluorescence was used to detect
   it and its co-localization with protein Period (PER), an important
   component of the circadian clock, in various regions of both structures.
   The ELISA results were analyzed using Cosinor and one-way ANOVA with
   Bonferroni and Scheffe's post hoc tests. The results of this analysis
   showed that the GFAP levels present circadian oscillations in both
   structures. Moreover, GFAP was localized in different structures of the
   eyestalk and brain; however, co-localization with PER occurred only in
   the lamina ganglionaris, specifically in the cartridges of the eyestalk
   and in some of the cluster 9 brain cells. These results suggest that as
   in other invertebrates and vertebrates, glial cells could be involved in
   the circadian system of P. clarkii; however, thus far we cannot know

Abstract = {Reproduction in arthropods is an interesting area of research where
   intrasexual and intersexual mechanisms have evolved structures with
   several functions. The mating plugs usually produced by males are good
   examples of these structures where the main function is to obstruct the
   female genitalia against new sperm depositions. In spiders several types
   of mating plugs have been documented, the most common ones include
   solidified secretions, parts of the bulb or in some extraordinary cases
   the mutilation of the entire palpal bulb. Here, we describe the first
   case of modified setae, which are located on the cymbial dorsal base,
   used directly as a mating plug for the Order Araneae in the species
   Maeota setastrobilaris sp. n. In addition the taxonomic description of
   M. setastrobilaris sp. n. is provided and based on our findings the
   geographic distribution of this genus is extended to the Northern

Abstract = {Although the origin of life cannot be dated with precision, life must
   have appeared soon after the cooling of the Earth, when the existence of
   liquid water on the planet enabled primitive oceans to exist. In fact,
   fossil records support the evidence of life on Earth earlier than 3400
   Ma ago. In order to understand the origin of life, it is useful to track
   geochemical factors such as the presence of carbon and isotopic
   evidence, which also suggests the presence of microbials. Eoarchean
   crustal rocks are located on Akilia Island and on the Isua Greenstone
   belt southwest of Greenland. The oldest recognized microfossil record is
   3430 Ma old from Strelley Pool Formation cherts, Pilbara, Australia. In
   Paleontology, it is necessary to reevaluate the outcrops of the oldest
   rock in light of new technologies, new techniques, and a
   multidisciplinary approach. This will help support data about when life

Title = {Assessing the importance of multiple threats to an endangered globose
   cactus in Mexico: Cattle grazing, looting and climate change},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {73-81},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cacti are a priority for conservation because their slow recovery rates
   and high habitat specificity make their populations particularly
   susceptible to looters who raid their populations, anthropogenic
   disturbance and climate change (CC). Identifying the most damaging
   threat is critical to the direction and efficiency of conservation
   efforts. We analyzed the impacts of looting, disturbance and CC on the
   geographically rare globose cactus Coryphantha werdermannii in Coahuila,
   Northern Mexico. We collected evidence on looting and estimated the
   impacts of seed and adult plant extraction through demographic models.
   We compared 10 sites differing in disturbance intensity and analyzed the
   effect on plant density, size structure and reproduction. The potential
   distribution of C. werdermannii under current conditions and future,CC
   was assessed through ecological niche modeling. We found that looting is
   mostly confined to seeds, which have little impact on population growth
   and therefore not responsible for population decline. As in many globose
   cacti, the density of C. werdermannii populations increased with
   disturbance, likely because cattle grazing increases recruitment rates.
   Contrastingly, even the most optimistic CC scenarios suggest a 90\%
   reduction in the potential distribution area by 2050, indicating that C.
   werdermannii is an endangered species most threatened by CC. We suggest
   that relocation programs and the maintenance of livestock levels
   appropriate for this species (moderate-high) may effectively counteract
   or delay the effects of CC. Our results suggest that current efforts are
   devoted to relatively minor threats, while CC is neglected, and
   highlight the importance of formal assessments of multiple threats. (C)

Abstract = {Predesigned push-pull azo-dye polymers were homogeneously dispersed
   within a SiO2 sol-gel matrix synthesized via the sonogel (SG) route.
   High-quality spin-coated films were obtained with these hybrid
   structures in the liquid sol-phase. The spectroscopic UV-Vis analyses
   reveal the appropriate insertion of these organic compounds within the
   highly pure SG-environment whereas the thermal (DSC) analysis and
   photoacoustic measurements evidence the thermomechanical stability of
   the amorphous hybrid layers. As the optical attenuation, refractive
   index and film thickness values of the obtained films are adequate for
   opto-electronic applications; these hybrid films were implemented to
   fabricate optical waveguiding prototypes. In this sense, functional
   planar waveguides were fabricated for nonlinear optical (NLO)
   applications after performing a molecular ordering via a corona
   DC-poling procedure in order to achieve a macroscopic polar order
   (ferroelectric and noncentrosymmetric arrangement of the organic
   chromophores). The poled films were then able to exhibit stable
   NLO-waveguiding effects as excited with a Nd:YAG laser system in order
   to generate second harmonic waves travelling within the planar layer.},

Abstract = {Intraluminal gestation, as it occurs in viviparous goodeids, allows a
   wide diversity of embryo-maternal metabolic exchanges. The branchial
   placenta occurs in embryos developing in intraluminal gestation when
   ovarian folds enter through the operculum, into the branchial chamber.
   The maternal ovarian folds may extend to the embryonic pharyngeal
   cavity. A branchial placenta has been observed in few viviparous
   teleosts, and there are not previous histological analyses. This study
   analysis the histological structure in the goodeid Ilyodon whitei. The
   moterno ovarian folds extend through the embryonic operculum and reach
   near the gills, occupying part of the branchial chamber. These folds
   extend also into the pharyngeal cavity. In some regions, the epithelia
   of the ovarian folds and embryo were in apposition, developing a
   placental structure in which, maternal and embryonic capillaries lie in
   close proximity. The maternal epithelium has desquamated cells which may
   enter through the branchial chamber to the pharyngeal cavity and the
   alimentary tract. The complex processes that occur in the ovaries of
   viviparous teleosts, and its diverse adaptations for viviparity, as the
   presence of branchial placenta, are relevant in the study of the
   evolution of vertebrate viviparity. J. Morphol. 275:1406-1417, 2014. (c)

Title = {Bacterial genomes lacking long-range correlations may not be modeled by
   low-order Markov chains: The role of mixing statistics and frame shift

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between exponential correlation functions
   and Markov models in a bacterial genome in detail. Despite the well
   known fact that Markov models generate sequences with correlation
   function that decays exponentially, simply constructed Markov models
   based on nearest-neighbor dimer (first-order), trimer (second-order), up
   to hexamer (fifth-order), and treating the DNA sequence as being
   homogeneous all fail to predict the value of exponential decay rate.
   Even reading-frame-specific Markov models (both first- and fifth-order)
   could not explain the fact that the exponential decay is very slow.
   Starting with the in-phase coding-DNA-sequence (CDS), we investigated
   correlation within a fixed-codon-position subsequence, and in
   artificially constructed sequences by packing CDSs with out-of-phase
   spacers, as well as altering CDS length distribution by imposing an
   upper limit. From these targeted analyses, we conclude that the
   correlation in the bacterial genomic sequence is mainly due to a mixing
   of heterogeneous statistics at different codon positions, and the decay
   of correlation is due to the possible out-of-phase between neighboring
   CDSs. There are also small contributions to the correlation from bases
   at the same codon position, as well as by non-coding sequences. These
   show that the seemingly simple exponential correlation functions in
   bacterial genome hide a complexity in correlation structure which is not
   suitable for a modeling by Markov chain in a homogeneous sequence. Other
   results include: use of the (absolute value) second largest eigenvalue
   to represent the 16 correlation functions and the prediction of a 10-11
   base periodicity from the hexamer frequencies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Superfoetation is the ability of females to simultaneously bear multiple
   broods of embryos at different developmental stages. Most studies on the
   phylogenetic distribution of superfoetation and on the factors that
   potentially promote superfoetation ignore variation within species.
   Here, we studied 11 populations of two species of viviparous fishes of
   the family Poeciliidae (Poeciliopsis gracilis and Poeciliopsis infans)
   and document wide variation in superfoetation and in three related life
   history traits: brood size, individual embryo mass and total
   reproductive allotment. We found significant differences in the average
   number of simultaneous broods among populations of P. gracilis but not
   among populations of P. infans. In addition, we found even greater
   variation between months within populations for both species, although
   no specific pattern of temporal variation was evident. Instead of the
   expected consistency of seasonal differences in superfoetation across
   populations, we found that large variation among months within seasons
   and the amount and direction of this monthly variation differed widely
   between populations. Our results emphasize the importance of including
   intraspecific variation in superfoetation and other life history traits
   in studies that aimed at finding general explanations of life history
   trait evolution.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Viviparous fishes of the family Poeciliidae have been model systems in
   the study of life histories because of their remarkable variation in
   life-history traits both within and among species, and because of the
   diversity of selective environments that they occupy. However, the life
   histories of several poeciliids remain unknown. In this study, we
   describe the life history of Gambusia vittata, a poorly known poeciliid
   endemic to eastern Mexico. We analyze variation in number of embryos per
   reproductive female, size of individual embryos, size at maturity,
   reproductive effort, the amount of maternal transfer of nutrients to
   developing embryos, and the relationship between female size and
   life-history traits. We collected individuals from three sites across 3
   months. We found that brood size varied significantly across sites and
   that brood size, embryo mass, and reproductive allotment varied across
   months within sites. Brood size, embryo mass, and reproductive allotment
   all increased with female size. We found that this species exhibits
   moderate matrotrophy, meaning that females transfer small amounts of
   nutrients to embryos during development. We compare our results to other
   poeciliid species and provide tentative explanations for the patterns of
   intraspecific variation that we observed in the life history of G.
   vittata.},

Title = {Patterns of spatio-temporal variation in the survival rates of a

Abstract = {Examination of the spatial and temporal variation in survival rates
   provides insight on how the action of natural selection varies among
   populations of single species. In this study, we used mark-recapture
   data from seven populations of the viviparous lizard Sceloporus
   grammicus in Central Mexico and a multi-model inference framework to
   examine interpopulation variation in the survival of adult males and
   females. We aimed to analyze the potential effects of aridity,
   human-induced disturbance, and reproductive costs on the survival rates
   of these lizards. For females in particular, we also searched for a
   negative relationship between litter size (adjusted for female size) and
   female survival. Our results demonstrate seasonal changes in survival
   for males and females. In three out of our seven study sites female
   survival decreased during the birthing season. In contrast, male
   survival did not appear to decrease during the mating season. We found
   an interaction between site-specific aridity and reproductive season
   affecting female survival. A decrease in female survival during the
   birthing season was observed in relatively arid sites. In one of these
   arid sites we found a negative effect of size-adjusted litter size on
   female survival: females producing more offspring than those expected
   for their size were more likely to die. This result represents evidence
   of a physiological trade-off for gravid females occurring in at least
   one of the studied populations. Interpopulation variation in the degree
   of human-induced disturbance could not explain the observed patterns of
   spatial variation in survival rates. Our results demonstrate wide
   variation in sex-specific survival patterns of this viviparous lizard
   and provide evidence that negative associations between reproduction and
   survival are highly dependent on the local environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {A topological space is almost irresolvable if it cannot be written as a
   countable union of subsets with empty interior. Given a cardinal kappa,
   denote by ({*}kappa) the statement ``the Cantor cube 2(2 kappa) has a
   dense subspace of size kappa which is almost irresolvable and whose
   dispersion character is equal to kappa.{''} In this paper we prove:
   (1) ({*}kappa) is equivalent to the existence of a dense subspace of 2(2
   kappa) which is Baire submaximal and whose cardinality and dispersion
   character are both equal to is. In particular, ({*}kappa) implies that
   kappa is measurable in an inner model of ZFC.
   (2) If the Continuum Hypothesis holds, ({*}kappa) fails for all kappa.
   (3) ({*}kappa) is equivalent to the existence of an omega(1)-complete
   ideal I on kappa containing all sets of cardinality < kappa and such
   that the quotient Boolean algebra P(kappa)/I is isomorphic to the
   complete Boolean algebra that adjoins 2(kappa) Cohen reals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Oogonial proliferation in fishes is an essential reproductive strategy
   to generate new ovarian follicles and is the basis for unlimited
   oogenesis. The reproductive cycle in viviparous teleosts, besides
   oogenesis, involves development of embryos inside the ovary, that is,
   intraovarian gestation. Oogonia are located in the germinal epithelium
   of the ovary. The germinal epithelium is the surface of ovarian lamellae
   and, therefore, borders the ovarian lumen. However, activity and
   seasonality of the germinal epithelium have not been described in any
   viviparous teleost species regarding oogonial proliferation and
   folliculogenesis. The goal of this study is to identify the histological
   features of oogonial proliferation and folliculogenesis during the
   reproductive cycle of the viviparous goodeid Ilyodon whitei. Ovaries
   during nongestation and early and late gestation were analyzed. Oogonial
   proliferation and folliculogenesis in I. whitei, where intraovarian
   gestation follows the maturation and fertilization of oocytes, do not
   correspond to the late oogenesis, as was observed in oviparous species,
   but correspond to late gestation. This observation offers an example of
   ovarian physiology correlated with viviparous reproduction and provides
   elements for understanding the regulation of the initiation of processes
   that ultimately result in the origin of the next generation. These
   processes include oogonia proliferation and development of the next
   batch of germ cells into the complex process of intraovarian gestation.

Title = {Do freshwater ecoregions and continental shelf width predict patterns of
   historical gene flow in the freshwater fish Poecilia butleri?},

Abstract = {We examined historical patterns of gene flow in the freshwater fish
   Poecilia butleri in western Mexico. We tested the hypothesis that the
   boundaries between four freshwater ecological communities (ecoregions)
   might have limited the movement of P.butleri because changes in species
   compositions might restrict establishment between adjacent ecoregions,
   even in situations where a physical barrier is absent. Hence, we
   predicted that boundaries between ecoregions should correspond to
   phylogeographical breaks in P.butleri. We also tested the hypothesis
   that the width of the continental shelf affected historical gene flow in
   P.butleri because a broad continental shelf provides a greater
   opportunity for rivers to coalesce during historical episodes of low sea
   levels as opposed to a narrow continental shelf that should restrict the
   potential for gene flow among adjacent rivers. Hence, we predicted
   greater amounts of historical gene flow among neighbouring river basins
   in the region of western Mexico where the continental shelf is wider,
   whereas, in the region where the continental shelf is narrower, we
   expected to detect limited levels of historical gene flow. We analyzed
   mitochondrial DNA sequence data (cytochrome b) taken from 264
   individuals of P.butleri collected from 34 locations distributed across
   four different ecoregions in western Mexico. To examine patterns of
   phylogenetic diversification and historical gene flow in P.butleri, we
   employed several analytical approaches, including traditional tree-based
   phylogenetic analyses (likelihood and parsimony), haplotype network
   reconstruction, analyses of molecular variance, and spatial analysis of
   molecular variance. We found genetic breaks coinciding with two out of
   three different ecoregion boundaries, suggesting limited historical gene
   flow. In addition to different species compositions between these
   adjacent ecoregions, geological features such as the Trans-Mexican
   Volcanic Belt and the mountainous topography in south-western Mexico,
   likely contributed to these observed genetic breaks. By contrast, no
   genetic break was evident between two other ecoregions, a result that
   partially rejects our first hypothesis. Several results were consistent
   with our second hypothesis. Changes in the width of the continental
   shelf in western Mexico are associated with the observed patterns of
   historical gene flow. Our results indicate that the interactions among
   multiple geological and biological factors affect the spatial patterns
   of genetic diversity of widespread freshwater species.(c) 2014 The

Abstract = {A taxonomic revision of the populations referable to the wide ranging
   species Incilius occidentalis was conducted based on 10 morphometric
   variables and other external morphological traits. Thirty three
   populations were geographically defined from more than 220 locality
   records of the species. A brief summary of the nomenclatural history of
   this species is presented and the external morphological variation is
   analyzed. Incilius occidentalis is here redescribed on the basis of
   comparisons with the 3 specimens housed at the Old Collection of the
   Torino Museum, and over 850 specimens held at several herpetological
   collections. Statistical analysis using principal components analysis
   (PCA) demonstrated that SVL concentrates the main part of the variance
   observed in these populations. No distinguishable populations were
   detected on the basis of morphometric differences using the Tukey HSD
   analysis. Body proportions are fairly similar between the 33 populations
   defined, suggesting the idea that the typical body shape of the bufonid
   genera is also perceived in this species. The species I. occidentalis is
   fully redescribed, 1 lectotype and 2 paralectotypes are designated. The
   geographic range of this species is accurately defined and the type
   locality is restricted to the City of Guanajuato, and surroundings,
   Mexico.},

Abstract = {The notion of monotonically monolithic space was introduced by V.V.
   Tkachuk in 2009 {[}8]. In this paper we introduce the notion of monotone
   stability and show that a space C-p (X) is monotonically monolithic if
   and only if X is monotonically stable. As a consequence, a space C-p (X)
   is monotonically stable if and only if X is monotonically monolithic. We
   also prove that C-p (X) is monotonically monolithic when X is a
   Sigma(k)-product of a family of Lindelof Sigma-spaces. These results
   answer some questions posed by A. Tamariz-Mascarua and the author in a
   previous paper {[}7]. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A test of the fast-slow continuum model of life-history variation in the
   lizard Sceloporus grammicus},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {235-248},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The fast-slow continuum hypothesis (Promislow and Harvey,
   1990) suggests that mortality rates are a strong selective factor that
   shapes inter-and intraspecific variation in life-history traits. At the
   fast end of the continuum, we expect higher mortality rates, faster
   growth rates, small size and/or early age at maturity, short lifespan,
   and large litters with smaller offspring. At the slow end, we expect the
   opposite.
   Question: Is intraspecific (spatial) variation in life-history traits
   associated with spatial differences in mortality rates, as the fast-slow
   continuum hypothesis suggests?
   Organism: The viviparous lizard Sceloporus grammicus (Sauria:
   Phrynosomatidae).
   Study system: Eight different populations of S. grammicus in central
   Mexico (latitudinal range: 19 degrees 11'N to 20 degrees 47'N).
   Methods: We used likelihood methods to calculate mortality rates from
   mark-recapture data. We also measured rates of body growth, size and age
   at maturity, litter size, offspring size, and offspring body condition
   from marked animals, preserved specimens, and females kept in captivity.
   We used a multi-model inference framework to examine inter-population
   variation in life-history traits and their potential association with
   mortality. Each model represented a different hypothesis about variation
   in life-history traits, and the relative fit of each was determined
   using AICc (adjusted Akaike Information Criterion).
   Conclusions: Life-history traits differed widely among populations, but
   litter size was the only trait that varied with site-specific mortality
   rates. Larger litters were associated with higher mortality, consistent
   with the fast-slow continuum hypothesis. Other life-history traits
   showed no clear evidence of influence of mortality rates.},

Title = {Informed dispersal in plants: Heterosperma pinnatum (Asteraceae)
   adjusts its dispersal mode to escape from competition and water stress},
Journal = {OIKOS},

Volume = {123},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Informed-dispersal theory (IDT) states that organisms may use
   information on the quality of the local environment when deciding
   whether to disperse or not. Dispersal is expected to occur from adverse
   patches where the costs of philopatry (lack of dispersal) are greater
   than those of dispersal. Evidence of informed dispersal in plants is
   scarce, and experiments under natural conditions are lacking. We tested
   IDT in a semiarid grassland using the annual forb Heterosperma pinnatum,
   which produces awned, zoochorous achenes and unawned, philopatric ones.
   We expected the proportion of awned seeds to increase under adverse
   conditions that reduce fitness, (i.e. under high competition and water
   stress). Heterosperma pinnatum was sown along natural moisture gradients
   with and without a shade that increased water availability. We found
   that competition (number of conspecific neighbors) and water stress
   reduced fitness. As expected, the proportion of highly dispersible seeds
   increased under such conditions, probably as a strategy to escape from
   unsuitable patches. Many plants species do not behave as expected by
   IDT. Our results suggest that experiments under natural conditions in
   systems where the assumptions of IDT are met may prove to be a wealthy
   source of evidence for informed dispersal in plants.},

Title = {A phylogenetic approach to the early evolution of autotrophy: the case
   of the reverse TCA and the reductive acetyl-CoA pathways},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {91-97},
Abstract = {In recent decades, a number of hypotheses on the autotrophic origin of
   life have been presented. These proposals invoke the emergence of
   reaction networks leading from CO or CO2 to the organic molecules
   required for life. It has also been suggested that the last (universal)
   common ancestor (LCA or LUCA) of all extant cell lineages was a
   chemolitho-autotrophic thermophilic anaerobe. The antiquity of some
   carbon fixation pathways, the phylogenetic basal distribution of some
   autotrophic organisms, and the catalytic properties of iron-sulfur
   minerals have been advanced in support of these ideas. Here we
   critically examine the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of
   enzymes that are essential for two of the most ancient autotrophic means
   of metabolism: the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle and the
   reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of citryl-CoA
   synthetase and of citryl-CoA lyase, key enzymatic components of the rTCA
   cycle, and of CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, a key enzyme in the
   reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, revealed that all three enzymes have
   undergone major lateral transfer events and therefore cannot be used as
   proof of the LCA's metabolic abilities nor as evidence of an autotrophic
   origin of life.},

   middle-upper part of Ixtaltepec Formation, establishes for the first
   time their presence in the Pennsylvanian of Mexico, age previously dated
   by the presence of several groups of brachiopods. The morphology of the

Volume = {85},

Abstract = {Based on a thorough analysis of the literature on Lepidoptera associated
   with Mexico, and a review of the database MARIPOSA (> 500 000 records
   and specimens), a synthesis of the global Lepidoptera diversity is
   presented, including estimates and proportions of diversity and endemism
   in Mexico. In addition, a detailed examination of the species richness
   and endemism of one of the best-known families in Mexico, Papilionoidea
   s. lat., is provided, preceded by a summary of state-level,
   habitat-specific and transect-based research on Lepidoptera diversity
   conducted over the past 3 decades. In summary, Mexico hosts about 14 500
   documented species of Lepidoptera, with about 23 750 species estimated.
   These figures suggest that 10\% of the world's Lepidoptera taxa are
   represented in Mexico. Among Papilionoidea, similarly, about 10\% of the
   world's taxa are reported from Mexico. Percentages of endemic species
   for the various families of Papilionoidea in Mexico are: Hesperiidae
   15.83\%, Papilionidae 6.3\%, Pieridae 12.98\%, Lycaenidae 5.27\%,
   Riodinidae 11.86\% and Nymphalidae 16.29\%. When subspecies are
   considered, 22.2\% of these taxa are endemic to Mexico, almost a quarter
   of all subspecies in the country. The number of endemic taxa represented
   in each state and biogeographic province is tabulated from a list of
   about 450 endemic subspecies. Oaxaca and the Sierra Madre del Sur
   represent the state and biogeographic province with the highest
   proportion of endemic taxa, while Chiapas and the Gulf Coast region
   represent the state and biogeographic province hosting the greatest
   overall diversity.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to map the burned areas of the Selva El Ocote
   Biosphere Reserve for the period 19982012, using Landsat TM/ETM+ images.
   The method was based on a visual comparison of false color images and
   the pre/post-fire spectral indices Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); it used official records
   of wildfires from the National Commission for Natural Protected Areas
   and National Forestry Commission, and hotspots identified by the
   National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity and the Fire
   Information for Resource Management System. Landsat images were
   downloaded during the fire season, January-June, for each year.
   According to the results, 54,756 ha were affected by 1095 fires during
   1998-2012. We estimated that 352 of them involved tropical forest and
   743 pasture, savannah and secondary tropical forest. The catastrophic
   years were associated with El Nino events 1998 (42,240 ha), 2003 (1,643
   ha) and 2005 (1,248 ha), suggesting that the meteorological conditions
   contributed to the vulnerability of vegetation to fire. These results
   illustrate a method for analysing the pattern of spatial and temporal
   distribution of burned areas and for identifying zones that merit
   priority attention with regard to agricultural burning and wildfires.},

Abstract = {In Mexico, 146 species of heterotrophic flagellates, included in
   Rhizaria, Stramenopiles and Excavata, have been reported. Parabasalids,
   opalines, trypanosomatids and bodonids have the higher specific
   richness. The genera Trypanosoma, Trichomonas, Metadevescovina and Bodo,
   contain the greatest number of species, and Bodo has been reported from
   a variety of habitats. Trypanosoma is the genus with the widest
   geographic distribution due to its presence in 20 Mexican states. We
   conclude that the study of heterotrophic flagellates is only partial and
   new species, new habitats and new geographic records are possible.},

   Crystal-Violet-Dye/H2O Based Dissolutions via the Pulsed
   Laser Photoacoustic Technique},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Different thermoelastic parameters, for example, the acoustic
   attenuation and the speed of sound, are fundamental for instrumental
   calibration and quantitative characterization of organic-based
   dissolutions. In this work, these parameters as functions of the
   concentration of an organic dye (crystal-violet: CV) in distillated
   water (H2O) based dissolutions are investigated. The speed of sound was
   measured by the pulsed-laser photoacoustic technique (PLPA), which
   consists in the generation of acoustic-waves by the optical absorption
   of pulsed light in a given material (in this case a liquid sample). The
   thermally generated sound-waves traveling through a fluid are detected
   with two piezoelectric sensors separated by a known distance. An
   appropriate processing of the photoacoustic signals allows an adequate
   data analysis of the generated waves within the system, providing an
   accurate determination of the speed of sound as function of the
   dye-concentration. The acoustic attenuation was calculated based on the
   distance of the two PZT-microphones to an acoustic-source point and
   performing linear-fitting of the experimental data (RMS-amplitudes) as
   function of the dye-concentration. An important advantage of the
   PLPA-method is that it can be implemented with poor or null optical
   transmitting materials permitting the characterization of the mechanical
   and concentration/aggregate properties of dissolved organic compounds.},

Pages = {69-88},

Abstract = {Conspecific populations inhabiting different environments may exhibit
   morphological differences, potentially reflecting differential local
   adaptation. In anuran amphibians, morphology of the pelvis and hindlimbs
   may often experience strong selection due to effects on locomotion. In
   this study, we used the cane toad Rhinella marina to test the hypothesis
   that populations experiencing a higher abundance of predators should
   suffer higher mortality rates and exhibit morphological traits
   associated with enhanced locomotor performance (narrower pelvis and
   head, longer pelvis and hindlimbs, shorter presacral vertebral column).
   We investigated inter-population variation in survival rate, abundance
   of predators, and body shape across five populations in rivers in
   western Mexico. We conducted (1) mark-recapture experiments to calculate
   survival rates, (2) linear transects with point counts to estimate
   abundance of predatory spiders, snakes, and birds, and (3) geometric
   morphometric analyses to investigate body shape variation. We found
   significant differences among populations in survival rates, abundance
   of predators, and body shape. However, these three variables were not
   necessarily inter-related. Increased predator abundance did not result
   in decreased survival rates, suggesting other causes of mortality affect
   these populations. While some morphological differences supported our
   predictions (trend for longer pelvis, shorter presacral vertebral
   column, and narrower head in sites with increased abundance of spiders
   and snakes), other aspects of morphology did not. We discuss alternative
   explanations for the lack of clear associations between predation,
   survival, and morphology.},

Abstract = {In 1920, the German botanist Hans Winkler coined the concept of the
   `genome'. This paper explores the history of a concept that has
   developed in parallel with advances in biology and supports novel and
   powerful heuristic biological research in the 21st century. From a
   structural interpretation (the genome as the haploid number of
   chromosomes), it has changed to keep pace with technological progress
   and new interpretations of the material of heredity. In the first place,
   the `genome' was extended to include all the material in the nucleus,
   then the sum of all genes, and (with the discovery of the structure of
   DNA) the sum of the nucleotide base sequences. In the early 21st
   century, it has become a much more complex and central concept that has
   spawned the growing field of studies referred to as the `omics'.},

   insight on the particular selection pressures that drive phenotypic
   divergence among populations. We conducted a demographic study of eight
   distinct populations of the viviparous lizard Sceloporus grammicus in
   central Mexico. We estimated variation among populations in
   stage-specific survival, growth, and fecundity. Using these data we
   constructed site-specific population projection matrices to estimate
   population growth rates, which we interpreted as measures of the average
   fitness of each population. Elasticity analysis was used to calculate
   the relative contribution of the three life-cycle components to
   population growth rates. The three life-cycle components had relatively
   high elasticity values, which meant that survival, growth, and fecundity
   contributed similarly to fitness. However, some variation was found
   among populations. We searched for potential associations between the
   observed interpopulation variation in these measures of relative
   importance for average fitness and interpopulation variation in
   temperature, rainfall, population density, microhabitat availability,
   degree of human-induced disturbance, and overall mortality. None of
   these environmental factors or their interactions could explain the
   observed interpopulation variation in the relative importance of the
   life-cycle components. Our results provide insight about how these
   viviparous lizards allocate resources to survival, growth, and fecundity
   in different environments.},

Abstract = {Pristine ecosystems are scarce worldwide. Understanding the community
   structure of amphibians and reptiles in pristine forests allows us to
   quantify the essential habitat features necessary for the species of
   animals and plants to survive. Data on the herpetofaunal community in
   pristine ecosystems also provides a baseline to evaluate the impacts of
   disturbance. We surveyed five vegetation types within a coniferous
   forest protected by indigenous people in a high mountain forest in
   southern Mexico. We found high endemism of the herpetofauna associated
   with temperature and humidity along an elevation gradient. Salamander
   richness and abundance was greater at higher elevations (2,760-3,260 m)
   in broadleaf and coniferous forests, and lizard and snake richness was
   greater at lower elevations (1,940-2,400 m) in riparian vegetation,
   oak-pine, and pine-oak forests. Some salamander and snake species were
   restricted to particular vegetation types suggesting that the alteration
   of these vegetation types may negatively impact unique species. The
   community structure of amphibians and reptiles, based on composition,
   richness, and abundance, can be used as an indicator to evaluate
   environmental changes in conservation and restoration projects.},

Abstract = {Documenting patterns of published studies on the biodiversity of
   megadiverse countries can offer valuable insights on global biodiversity
   knowledge. Here, I present results from a bibliometric analysis of 5,264
   indexed publications on biodiversity in Colombia published during the
   period 1990-2011 and gathered by searching the Web of Knowledge
   database. I classified studies into six overlapping subjects: taxa
   lists, new taxa, new records, conservation, genetic diversity, and
   other. Publications were also classified by geographic location and the
   taxonomic group studied. I found variation in the number of studies per
   year, which presented a long-term trend of increasing volume. The 31
   continental departments of Colombia and both the Atlantic and the
   Pacific oceans were represented in the studies, which included 98
   taxonomic classes from 47 phyla. However, there were strong biases in
   taxonomic, geographic, and subject coverage. For instance, 75 \% of
   studies focused on animals; and the Atlantic Ocean showed the highest
   number of studies, followed by Antioquia and Valle del Cauca
   departments. Genetic diversity and conservation were the least-studied
   subjects. I also found that Colombian researchers and Colombian
   institutions have played an important role in documenting the country's
   outstanding biodiversity. However, Colombian biologists still prefer to
   publish in domestic or Latin American journals, which are mainly
   regional and have low international visibility. The patterns I present
   here can have important implications for optimizing and guiding research
   on Colombian biodiversity, and the paper concludes with some
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {The production of biodiesel utilizing microalgae has driven innovation
   worldwide, especially trying to overcome the current economic and
   technological limitations of the whole process. Within these efforts,
   the use of wastewater to cultivate oleaginous microalgae or the use of
   dual-purpose microalgae-bacteria-based systems that treat wastewater and
   produce oleaginous microalgae have become an attractive alternative. The
   aim of this work was to evaluate the population dynamics which occurred
   in mixed cultures of Neochloris oleoabundans with other native
   microalgae, in mixtures of a synthetic medium (BBM) and water of an
   urban polluted river. The effect of temperature, nutrient availability
   and the microscopic monitoring of the population dynamics in such mixed
   cultures were carried out. Furthermore, the isolation of the predominant
   consortium of diatoms and the evaluation of its kinetics of growth and
   its capacity for removal of pollutants was also performed. Results
   indicated that such green microalgae only predominated in mixtures
   containing 80\% or 60\% of the synthetic medium. In mixtures containing
   a volume of the polluted river higher than 40\%, other microalgae
   predominated, especially diatoms of various genera. The diatom
   consortium isolated from a 100\% of the river's water sampled in spring
   (April), was formed mainly by a population of Nitzchia frustulum and in
   less extent of Navicula sp. It showed a significantly higher specific
   growth rate when cultivated in water from the river, compared to
   cultures in synthetic modified diatom medium (MDM) and at 32 degrees C,
   compared to cultures incubated at 25 degrees C. The consortium was able
   to remove 95.45\% and 95.78\% of ammonia nitrogen, 60\% and 62.5\% of
   nitrates at 32 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively, after 2 days.
   It also removed 95\% of phosphates at 32 degrees C and 67\% at 25
   degrees C after 4 days from the polluted river. Diatoms also showed
   significant accumulation of lipids after 10 days of cultivation when
   stained with Sudan III. In conclusion, such diatom consortium showed a
   large potential for being used in a dual-purpose system that could treat
   the water from polluted streams and that could produce lipid rich
   biomass.},

Abstract = {We introduce a construction to ``periodize{''} a quasiperiodic lattice
   of obstacles, i.e., embed it into a unit cell in a higher-dimensional
   space, reversing the projection method used to form quasilattices. This
   gives an algorithm for simulating dynamics, as well as a natural notion
   of uniform distribution, in quasiperiodic structures. It also shows the
   generic existence of channels, where particles travel without colliding,
   up to a critical obstacle radius, which we calculate for a Penrose
   tiling. As an application, we find superdiffusion in the presence of
   channels, and a subdiffusive regime when obstacles overlap.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating lung disorder of unknown
   etiology. Although its pathogenesis is unclear, considerable evidence
   supports an important role of aberrantly activated alveolar epithelial
   cells (AECs), which produce a large variety of mediators, including
   several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which participate in fibroblast
   activation and lung remodeling. MMP-1 has been shown to be highly
   expressed in AECs from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs although its
   role is unknown. In this study, we explored the role of MMP-1 in several
   AECs functions. Mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE12) transfected with
   human Mmp-1 showed significantly increased cell growth and proliferation
   at 36 and 48 h of culture (p < 0.01). Also, MMP-1 promoted MLE12 cell
   migration through collagen I, accelerated wound closing, and protected
   cells from staurosporine- and bleomycin-induced apoptosis compared with
   mock cells (p < 0.01). MLE12 cells expressing human MMP-1 showed a
   significant repression of oxygen consumption ratio compared with the
   cells with the empty vector. As under hypoxic conditions
   hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) mediates a transition
   from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, we analyzed activation of HIF-1
   alpha. Higher activation of this factor was detected in
   MMP-1-transfected cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Likewise, a
   significant decrease of both total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen
   species was observed in MMP-1-transfected cells. Paralleling these
   findings, attenuation of MMP-1 expression by shRNA in A549 (human) AECs
   markedly reduced proliferation and migration (p < 0.01) and increased
   the oxygen consumption ratio. These findings indicate that epithelial
   expression of MMP-1 inhibits mitochondrial function, increases HIF-1
   alpha expression, decreases reactive oxygen species production, and
   contributes to a proliferative, migratory, and anti-apoptotic AEC
   phenotype.},

Abstract = {Seminiferous tubules in mammals have histological arrangements defined
   by the associations between somatic cells and germ cells. The processes
   of DNA synthesis in meiotic and mitotic cells have different features
   that are not easily distinguishable through morphological means. In
   order to characterize the pre-meiotic S phase, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
   (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally into Wistar rats, which were
   sacrificed 30 min, 2 hr, and 24 hr after injection. We found three
   different labeling patterns. One of these patterns was characterized by
   a distribution of the label in the form of speckles, most of which were
   associated with the nuclear envelope (labeling type I). We suggest that
   this pattern is due to mitotic DNA synthesis of type B spermatogonia.
   Labeling type II consisted of labeled foci scattered throughout the
   nuclear volume, which can be correlated with preleptotenic cells in
   pre-meiotic DNA synthesis. After 24 hr of incorporation, a third type of
   labeling, characterized by large speckles, was found to be related to
   cells in the bouquet stage; that is, cells in transition between the
   leptotene and zygotene phases. Our results indicate that BrdU
   incorporation induces different labeling patterns in the mitotic and
   pre-meiotic S phases and thus makes it possible to identify somatic and
   germinal cells.},

   characters of the G. dubius group but differs from all other species of
   Geophis by having the loreal shorter than the combined prenasal and
   postnasal length, one postocular scale, one supraocular scale, the fifth
   supralabial and parietal in contact, dorsal scales in 17 rows, dorsal
   scales smooth throughout the length of the body or, if keeled, not
   anteriorly to the posterior fourth of the body, 129-140 ventrals in
   females and 125-139 in males, 26-31 subcaudals in females and 34-39 in
   males, 159-170 ventrals plus subcaudals in females and 161-174 in males,
   9 maxillary teeth, anterior tip of the maxilla toothless, an overall
   dark dorsum, a predominantly cream venter, and a short tail in males. A
   Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome b

Title = {Seed germination and early development in seedlings of Noveloa
   coulteriana (Podostemaceae)},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {25-30},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Unlike other aquatic plants, in Podostemaceae sexual reproduction is the
   primary mode of reproduction. Thus, germination and seedling
   establishment are essential processes in the life history of these
   plants, as they determine their distribution, survival, and abundance.
   Few studies have examined germination and early seedling development of
   the Mexican species of this family. In this paper, we experimentally
   evaluated the influence of light quality (white, red, far red, and
   darkness), storage time (three months, six months, and 10 years) and
   temperature (constant 25 degrees C and alternate 15-25 degrees C) on
   Noveloa coulteriana germination. Seeds were positive photoblastic, and
   showed high germination capacity in white and red light treatments
   (>80\%). In contrast to previously studied Mexican podostemads, N.
   coulteriana seeds are recalcitrant. Seeds were also thermoblastic;
   germination rate was slower in alternate temperature compared to
   constant temperature. Additionally, using electron microscopy, we
   observed ex situ seedling development during one month (until its
   senescence). Micromorphologically, N. coulteriana seedlings showed the
   characteristic developmental pattern of the subfamily Podostemoideae,
   where the embryonic shoot and root meristems are lost. Our results
   indicate that environmental factors such as light quality or temperature
   fluctuation modify seed germination of N. coulteriana and may play an
   important role in the reestablishment of natural populations. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Availability of water, soil conditions and recurring disturbances are
   the main factors that limit plant establishment in disturbed sites in
   tropical dry forests. The objective of this study was to assess the
   effect of applying compost and of plastic mulch on survival and initial
   plant growth of the woody species Dodonaea viscosa, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Lysiloma divaricatum, in a degraded pasture in
   northwestern Morelos. In 2009, 121-124 plants of each species were
   planted; 500 mL of compost, made from cattle manure, grass and tomato
   plant residues, and later, a plastic mulch (40 x 40 cm square) were
   applied to plants of each species selected at random. The following
   treatments were obtained: 1) compost, 2) plastic mulch, 3) compost and
   mulch, and 4) control (without compost or mulch). Survival and growth
   were recorded bi-monthly for one year. Survival was analyzed with a
   generalized linear model, and analyses of variance were performed for
   growth variables. The species with the highest survival rate was L.
   divaricatum (61 \%) and that with the lowest was D. viscosa (8 \%).
   Plastic mulch increased survival by 17 \% to 31 \%, depending on the
   species. Addition of compost had a significant effect (p <= 0.05) only
   on growth in diameter of L. leucocephala. Use of plastic mulch increased
   restoration success and can be used in other sites where soil
   characteristics and water stress limit establishment of woody species.},

Title = {Reconstructing shifts in vital rates driven by long-term environmental
   change: a new demographic method based on readily available data},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {2273-2284},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Frequently, vital rates are driven by directional, long-term
   environmental changes. Many of these are of great importance, such as
   land degradation, climate change, and succession. Traditional
   demographic methods assume a constant or stationary environment, and
   thus are inappropriate to analyze populations subject to these changes.
   They also require repeat surveys of the individuals as change unfolds.
   Methods for reconstructing such lengthy processes are needed. We present
   a model that, based on a time series of population size structures and
   densities, reconstructs the impact of directional environmental changes
   on vital rates. The model uses integral projection models and maximum
   likelihood to identify the rates that best reconstructs the time series.
   The procedure was validated with artificial and real data. The former
   involved simulated species with widely different demographic behaviors.
   The latter used a chronosequence of populations of an endangered cactus
   subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbance. In our simulations, the
   vital rates and their change were always reconstructed accurately.
   Nevertheless, the model frequently produced alternative results. The use
   of coarse knowledge of the species' biology (whether vital rates
   increase or decrease with size or their plausible values) allowed the
   correct rates to be identified with a 90\% success rate. With real data,
   the model correctly reconstructed the effects of disturbance on vital
   rates. These effects were previously known from two populations for
   which demographic data were available. Our procedure seems robust, as
   the data violated several of the model's assumptions. Thus, time series
   of size structures and densities contain the necessary information to
   reconstruct changing vital rates. However, additional biological
   knowledge may be required to provide reliable results. Because time
   series of size structures and densities are available for many species
   or can be rapidly generated, our model can contribute to understand
   populations that face highly pressing environmental problems.},

Title = {New Approaches to the Biogeography and Areas of Endemism of Red Oaks
   (Quercus L., Section Lobatae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {555-573},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {An area of endemism is defined by the spatial congruence among two or
   more species with distributions that are limited by barriers. In this
   study, we explored and discussed the use of the network analysis method
   (NAM) and neighbor-joining (NJ) to analyze the areas of endemism of
   Quercus sect. Lobatae (red oak species) in Mexico and Central America.
   We compared the NAM and NJ with other methods commonly used in
   biogeographic studies to show the advantages of these new approaches and
   to identify the shortcomings of other approaches. The NAM used in this
   study is based on notions of centrality measures, such as betweenness.
   We incorporated the strength of the ties within the internal networks
   through p-cores and aggregate constraints in iterative analyses. The NAM
   based on betweenness is ideal for recognizing completely allopatric
   areas of endemism. The iterative NAMs increase the number of possible
   areas of endemism because they minimize the effect of minimal overlap,
   and the p-core is efficient at identifying the closest relationships
   among species in the cases in which betweenness is not informative. The
   number of areas of endemism increases when the sympatry matrix minimizes
   the dispersal effect and the sample effort is maximized, allowing the
   identification of the greatest number of these areas. The NJ method
   supports the idea that areas diverge among themselves in a differential
   way; the long branches correspond to zones with high speciation rates
   and complex histories (biotic and tectonic), and the short branches
   correspond to zones with low speciation rates and simple histories. In a
   classification scheme, NJ was capable of identifying the areas that are
   considered biotically complex because of their high speciation rates.
   The results obtained with the NAM and NJ showed that the physiographic
   regions of Mexico are not natural units and that many of them are
   composed of at least two different biotic components. {[}Areas of

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Mexico is considered a megadiverse country containing more than 10\% of
   the world's biodiversity. The distribution of this species richness and
   endemism is different among the different Mexican states. We examined
   the species richness patterns of 13 families of vascular plants
   (including ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms) in Mexico using political
   divisions (states) as units of analysis. We analysed the species
   richness values (absolute richness, endemic richness and restrictive
   richness) of these plant families using stepwise multiple regression
   analysis, assessing their relationship with a set of 10 environmental
   variables (expressed as heterogeneity coefficients). A combined cluster
   analysis with multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and an analysis of
   similarities were also undertaken to define the spatial-geographical
   patterns. Additionally, we proposed a methodological strategy to
   determine which states of Mexico have priorities for conservation. Our
   results suggested that the three species richness values used were
   significantly predicted by environmental factors, especially by climatic
   heterogeneity. Notwithstanding that a linear pattern was recognized, the
   Mexican states were gathered in four groups, which were confirmed by the
   MDS and the cluster analysis: (1) the Yucatan Peninsula, (2) arid
   Mexico, (3) the Mexican Transition Zone and (4) the megadiverse states.
   We proposed that 12 Mexican states include all the environmental
   conditions and are candidates for developing conservation programmes:
   (1) Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Yucatan, (2) Baja California, Chihuahua
   and Sinaloa, (3) Guerrero, Jalisco and Nuevo Leon and (4) Chiapas,
   Oaxaca and Veracruz.},

Abstract = {Large vegetation disturbance rates have been reported in the ``Zoquiapan
   y Anexas{''} Protected Natural Area in Central Mexico. Arceuthobium
   globosum and A. vaginatum coexist within this area and have a
   deleterious impact on Pines hartwegii. This study seeks to understand
   the relationship between this disturbance and the two dwarf mistletoe
   species prevalent in this zone. Twenty-four plots measuring 60 x 55 m
   containing P. hartwegii trees were selected. Within these plots, the
   physical features of the land, the density of host and non-host trees,
   the prevalence of each mistletoe species, and six disturbance indicators
   were recorded. We found that A. vaginatum infests up to 47 \% of P.
   hartwegii trees and that its prevalence is affected positively by the
   slope, non-host tree density, and the proportion of stump and dead
   trees, but is negatively affected by the prevalence of A. globosum, fire
   incidence, waste deposit, and the distance to the nearest disturbance.
   Arceuthobium globosum infests up to 37 \% of the trees and is affected
   positively by altitude, the density of non-host trees, waste deposit and
   the distance to the nearest disturbance, but is negatively affected by
   the prevalence of A. vaginatum and the proportion of dead trees. The
   prevalence of both mistletoe species within the study area is governed
   by the physical environment, the anthropogenic disturbance and the
   negative interaction between these mistletoe species. Disturbance has an
   important impact on mistletoe populations, modifying their prevalence;
   so it is primordial to understand this relationship in order to propose
   control methods.},

Abstract = {The use of satellite data in combination with ground-based measurements
   can provide valuable information about atmospheric chemistry and air
   quality. In this study, ground-based Differential Optical Absorption
   Spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) conducted in
   central Mexico are compared with the space-borne Ozone Monitoring
   Instrument (OMI) dataset of 2006-2011. Ground-based measurements
   exhibited large day-to-day variations and were on average three times
   higher than the space-borne derived average over the observation site.
   This difference is attributed to strong horizontal inhomogeneity of the
   lower layer of the measured NO2 columns, sampled over a large footprint
   from the satellite instrument. Also, a reduced sensitivity of the
   satellite observation near the surface, where the largest concentrations
   are expected, could be responsible for this large discrepancy. From the
   analyzed OMI dataset, distribution maps of NO2 above central Mexico were
   reconstructed, allowing to identify three main areas with increased NO2
   column densities: The dominating metropolitan area of Mexico City, the
   heavily industrialized region of Tula to the north and the Cuernavaca
   valley to the south. In this analysis, seasonal variability of NO2
   columns over central Mexico was detected, finding higher NO2 columns
   during the dry and cold season, followed by the dry and warm period, and
   finally the lowest NO2 columns were found during the rainy season.
   Pollution transport of this gas from Tula into Mexico City, as well as
   towards the Cuernavaca valley, is evident from this dataset.},

Abstract = {In this work, we present a variational numerical method for structured
   convex hexahedral grid generation. This method is superior to the
   standard scheme in the sense that Azarenok presents in Azarenok (2006)
   {[}2]. It produces grids with good quality measured in terms of {[}2]
   and Ushakova (2001) {[}3]. To illustrate this new grid generation
   method, we include an application to a blast wave problem simulation in
   simply-connected domains studied by LeVeque et al. (2008) {[}9], where
   the resulting grids are smoother/better than {[}9]. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Consider a polynomial f is an element of R {[}x, y] whose Hessian curve
   is compact and the unbounded connected component of its complement is
   hyperbolic. We study the fields of asymptotic directions on this
   component. Thus, we determine an index formula for the field of
   asymptotic directions involving the number of connected components of
   the Hessian curve constituting the boundary of this component, and the
   number of the corresponding Gaussian cusps. As an application of this
   study we show an example of a polynomial of degree 4 with 10 Gaussian
   cusps. Moreover, we determine the parity of the Gaussian cusps on the
   boundary of the unbounded region of a graph of a polynomial.},

Abstract = {A deep understanding of the processes affecting the population dynamics
   of living organisms requires fine-scale analyses of basic demographic
   parameters such as stage-specific survival and growth rates. In this
   study we estimated survival, detection, and transition rates (growth)
   for different stages of the life cycle of a Knob-scaled Lizard of the
   genus Xenosaurus. We also examined potential sources of variation for
   these parameters by means of a multiple-model inference framework. Our
   capture mark recapture data revealed that survival rates were
   homogeneous among stage classes but markedly different between the rainy
   and dry seasons. Contrary to our expectation, survival probability was
   higher during dry months. Detection probability varied considerably
   among stage classes and through time. Consistent with theoretical
   predictions, the rate at which lizards moved from a particular stage
   class to the following (transition rates) varied among stage classes,
   with the fastest rates observed in yearlings and the slowest in adults.
   Also consistent with our predictions, we found a tendency toward faster
   transition rates during rainy months. We discuss the potential causes
   and implications of the patterns of variation observed in these key
   demographic parameters.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity in macroscopic fungi has been poorly studied in
   comparison to plants or animals and only general aspects of these
   changes have been described. In this work, the phenotypic variation in
   the basidiomata of Thelephora sp. (Thelephoraceae) was examined, as well
   as some aspects of its ecology and habitat, using 24 specimens collected
   in the tropical forests of the Chamela Biological Station, Jalisco,
   Mexico. Our observations showed that this taxon has clavarioid
   basidiomata that can become resupinate during development and growth if
   they are in contact with rocks, litter or live plants, establishing in
   the latter only an epiphytic relationship. This tropical species may
   form groups of up to 139 basidiomata over an area of 32.2m(2), and in
   both types of vegetation (tropical sub-evergreen and deciduous forest)
   were primarily located on steep (>20 degrees) South-facing slopes. It is
   found under closed canopy in both tropical forests, but its presence in
   sub-evergreen forests is greater than expected.},

Title = {Identifying the demographic processes relevant for species conservation

Abstract = {The identification of the demographic processes responsible for the
   decline in population growth rate (lambda) in disturbed areas would
   allow conservation efforts to be efficiently directed. Integral
   projection models (IPMs) are used for this purpose, but it is unclear
   whether the conclusions drawn from their analysis are sensitive to how
   functional structures (the functions that describe how survival, growth
   and fecundity vary with individual size) are selected. We constructed 12
   IPMs that differed in their functional structure by combining two
   reproduction models and three functional expressions (generalized
   linear, cubic and additive models), each with and without
   simplification. Models were parameterized with data from two populations
   of two endangered cacti subject to different disturbance intensities.
   For each model, we identified the demographic processes that most
   affected lambda in the presence of disturbance. Simulations were
   performed on artificial data and analyzed as above to assess the
   generality of the results. In both empirical and simulated data, the
   same processes were identified as making the largest contribution to
   changes in lambda regardless of the functional structure. The major
   differences in the results were due to misspecification of the fecundity
   functions, whilst functional expression and model simplification had
   lesser effects. Therefore, as long as the demographic attributes of the
   species are well known and incorporated into the model, IPMs will
   robustly identify the processes that most affect the growth of
   populations subject to disturbance, making them a reliable tool for
   developing conservation strategies.},

Title = {DOES RETAINED-SEED PRIMING DRIVE THE EVOLUTION OF SEROTINY IN DRYLANDS?
   AN ASSESSMENT USING THE CACTUS MAMMILLARIA HERNANDEZII},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {100},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-373},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Premise of the study: Serotinous plants retain their seeds for a long
   time. In deserts, retained seeds undergo hydration-dehydration cycles
   and thus may become primed. Priming enhances germination and seedling
   vigor. We test the hypothesis that serotiny evolves because it provides
   a site protected from predators in which seeds can become primed.
   Rainfall-cued dispersal of primed seeds may enhance this effect.
   Methods: We tested this hypothesis with Mammillaria hernandezii through
   protein-content analyses; field and laboratory germination experiments
   with primed, unprimed, and retained seeds; and fitness estimations from
   demographic models.
   Key results: Hydration-dehydration cycles induced priming, enhancing
   germination. Artificial priming and retention in the parent plant for 1
   yr induced similar changes in seed protein patterns, suggesting that
   priming occurs naturally while seeds are retained. Under field
   conditions, germination of seeds retained for 1 yr more than doubled
   that of seeds of the same cohort that were not primed or that remained
   buried for 1 yr. The first seeds to germinate died rapidly. Serotinous
   plants whose seeds underwent priming had higher fitness than those whose
   seeds were in the soil seed bank or that did not experience priming.
   Conclusions: Priming in soil seed banks may be costly because of high
   predation, so seed protection during priming is sufficient to promote
   the evolution of serotiny. Bet hedging contributes to this process.
   Rapid germination of primed seeds that respond to brief rainfall events
   is disadvantageous because such rainfall is insufficient for seedling
   survival. Serotinous species counteract this cost by cueing dispersal
   with heavy precipitation.},

Abstract = {A simple and inexpensive alternative to high-power lasers for the direct
   fabrication of microchannels and rapid prototyping of
   poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is presented. By focusing the infrared
   laser beam of a commercial, low-power CD-DVD unit on absorbing carbon
   micro-cluster additives, highly localized PDMS combustion can be used to
   etch the polymer, which is otherwise transparent at such wavelengths.
   Thanks to a precise and automated control of laser conditions,
   laser-induced incandescence is originated at the material surface and
   produces high-resolution micropatterns that present properties normally
   induced with lasers of much greater energies in PDMS: formation of in
   situ nanodomains, local fluorescence and waveguide patterns. An
   extensive study of the phenomenon and its performance for PDMS
   microfabrication are presented.},

Abstract = {On the basis of a general low polymorphism, several studies suggest that
   balancing selection in the class II major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) is weaker in marine mammals as compared with terrestrial mammals.
   We investigated such differential selection among Cetacea, Artiodactyla,
   and Primates at exon 2 of MHC-DQB gene by contrasting indicators of
   molecular evolution such as occurrence of transpecific polymorphisms,
   patterns of phylogenetic branch lengths by codon position, rates of
   nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions as well as accumulation of
   variable sites on the sampling of alleles. These indicators were
   compared between the DQB and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb)
   as a reference of neutral expectations and differences between molecular
   clocks resulting from life history and historical demography. All
   indicators showed that the influence of balancing selection on the DQB
   is more variable and overall weaker for cetaceans. In our sampling,
   ziphiids, the sperm whale, monodontids and the finless porpoise formed a
   group with lower DQB polymorphism, while mysticetes exhibited a higher
   DQB variation similar to that of terrestrial mammals as well as higher
   occurrence of transpecific polymorphisms. Different dolphins appeared in
   the two groups. Larger variation of selection on the cetacean DQB could
   be related to greater stochasticity in their historical demography and
   thus, to a greater complexity of the general ecology and disease
   processes of these animals.},

Abstract = {This work reviews concepts regarding the endogenous circadian clock and
   the relationship between oxidative stress (OS), light and entrainment in
   different organisms including crustaceans, particularly crayfish. In the
   first section, the molecular control of circadian rhythms in
   invertebrates, particularly in Drosophila, is reviewed, and this model
   is contrasted with recent reports on the circadian genes and proteins in
   crayfish. Second, the redox mechanisms and signaling pathways that
   participate in the entrainment of the circadian clock in different
   organisms are reviewed. Finally, the light signals and transduction
   pathways involved in the entrainment of the circadian clock,
   specifically in relation to cryptochromes (CRYs) and their dual role in
   the circadian clock of different animal groups and their possible
   relationship to the circadian clock and redox mechanisms in crustaceans
   is discussed. The relationship between metabolism, ROS signals and
   transcription factors, such as HIF-1 alpha in crayfish, as well as the
   possibility that HIF-1 alpha participates in the regulation of circadian
   control genes (ccgs) in crustaceans is discussed.},

Abstract = {Monitoring of influenza like illnesses (ILI) using the Internet has
   become more common since its beginnings nearly a decade ago. The initial
   project of Der Grote Griep Meting was launched in 2003 in the
   Netherlands and Belgium. It was designed as a means of engaging people
   in matters of scientific and public health importance, and indeed
   attracted participation from over 30,000 people in its first year. Its
   success thus gathered a wealth of potentially valuable epidemiological
   data complementary to those obtained through the established disease
   surveillance networks, and linked to rich background information on each
   participant. Since then, there has been an accelerated increase in the
   number of countries hosting similar websites, and many of these have
   generated rather promising results.
   In this talk, an analysis of the data from the Mexican monitoring
   website, ``Reporta{''} is presented, and the risk factors that are
   linked to reporting of ILI symptoms among its participants are
   determined and analyzed. The data base gathered from the launching of
   Reporta in May 2009 to September 2011 is used for this purpose. The
   definition of suspect ILI case employed by the Mexican Health Ministry
   is applied to distinguish a class C of participants; the traits gathered
   in the background questionnaire are labeled X-i. Risk associated to any
   given trait X-i is evaluated by considering the difference between the
   frequency with which C occurs among participants with trait X-i and in
   the general population. This difference is then normalized to assess its
   statistical significance.
   Interestingly, while some of the results confirm the suspected
   importance of certain traits indicative of enhanced susceptibility or a
   large contact network, others are unexpected and must be interpreted
   within an adequate framework. Thus, a taxonomy of background traits is
   proposed to aid interpretation, and tested through a new assessment of
   the associated risks. This work illustrates a way in which
   Internet-based monitoring can contribute to our understanding of disease
   spread.},

Abstract = {This study is a contribution to the biodiversity and community structure
   of clavarioid Agaricomycetes in the tropical forests of the Chamela
   Biological Station, in Jalisco, Mexico. The collections were made during
   the rainy seasons from 2005 to 2008 during which we recorded the
   morphological and ecological information, including basidiocarp
   morphology and patterns of growth. Likewise, records were also taken for
   habitat preferences, types of substrate, orientation, slope inclination,
   range of distribution and abundance. The 86 specimens recorded,
   corresponded to 17 different species, from which Physalacria changensis,
   R inflata, Pterula verticillata and Scytinopogon scaber are new records
   for Mexico. The species S. pallescens, Pterula sp. 2 and Thelephora sp.
   were the most abundant, while other 6 species were observed only once.
   Results suggested a non-random distribution of the basidiomes, showing
   clear preferences of these fungi to fruit in the southern slopes of
   tropical evergreen forest vegetation at angles from 21 degrees to 30
   degrees.},

Abstract = {Fourteen species of productid brachiopods from Ixtaltepec Formation,
   Oaxaca State in southeast Mexico, are described. All the species and
   most of the genus that are reported represent first records for Mexico,
   in the case of Echinoconchella this is the first report of the genus for
   North America. The species belong to the superfamilies Echinoconchoidea
   (Echinoconchus zapoteco sp. nov., Echinaria knighti, Karavankina cf.
   fasciata, Echinoconchella elegans), Linoproductoidea (Linoproductus cf.
   prattenianus, Linoproductus platyumbonus, Linoproductus sp.,

   Cancrinella nunduva sp. nov., Ovatia muralis and Nuanducosia sulcata,
   new genus and species of Subfamily Anidanthinae) and Aulostegoidea
   (?Sinuatella sp.). The stratigraphic distribution of E knighti,
   Karavankina cf. fasciata, Linoproductus cf. prattenianzts, L.
   platyumbonus, M. aureocollis and Marginovatia cf. pumila confirms a
   Pennsylvanian age (Morrowan-Desmonesian) for the strata of the middle
   part of Ixtaltepec Formation; the finding of Marginovatia minor and
   Ovatia muralis in basal strata of the formation sets a Middle-Upper
   Mississippian age (Chesterian) for bearing units. The fauna described
   has a strong similarity to species of the east-central region of the
   United States, similarity that confirms the existence of a connection
   between the two regions during the Carboniferous through a
   epicontinental sea.},

   present a morphological description of the female stage, together with
   16S rDNA sequences that confirm the conspecificity of our female, male,

   the dorsal surface is smooth (nothoaspis), appearing to consist of 3
   large ``subunits,{''} 1 anterior and 2 posterior, each with a small
   sublateral ``subunit{''} on either side. The remaining dorsal covered
   integument is a cell-like configuration. The hood is large and bluntly
   rounded, and visible dorsally. The spiracular plate is oval. It
   possesses 1 pair of posthypostomal setae. The palpal trochanter has 1
   pair of setae and a 5/5 hypostome decreasing to 4/4 at the apex. There
   is a single central pore at the base of the hypostome.},

Title = {Intraspecific variation in mortality rates of the livebearing fish
   Poeciliopsis baenschi},

Abstract = {Identifying differences in mortality rates in wild fish populations can
   provide insight into ecological and evolutionary variation within
   species, including differences between sexes. In this study, we examined
   natural mortality patterns among four populations of a viviparous
   freshwater fish (Poeciliopsis baenschi) from western Mexico that shows
   sexual size dimorphism. Our purpose was to test for differences in
   mortality rates among populations and to determine if these differences
   are sex- or size-dependent. We fit mark-recapture data to several
   competing models to test for differences in mortality rates among
   collection localities and between sexes, as well as to evaluate a
   potential relationship between size and mortality. The best-fitting
   model included an interaction between size and source population without
   a sex effect, indicating a strong relationship between size and
   mortality that differed among populations. In three populations, adult
   individuals of medium sizes experienced increased mortality rates
   compared to smaller or larger adults. In one of these three populations,
   this pattern was more pronounced with medium-sized individuals suffering
   strikingly higher mortality. In the remaining population, we found the
   opposite pattern: adult individuals of medium sizes experienced lower
   mortality rates compared to smaller or larger adults. In all cases,
   these effects were independent of sex. We consider explanations for this
   pattern based on ecological factors, such as differences in predation
   intensity, and discuss our results in the context of intraspecific
   phenotypic divergence. Our findings demonstrate the value of comparing
   mortality rates among populations within a fish species.},

Title = {Cross compatibility between Marathrum rubrum and Marathrum

   Pacific Mexican Coast},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {102},

Abstract = {Marathrum is a Neotropical genus of Podostemaceae that has been
   recognized for its elevated degree of vegetative polymorphism. Marathrum
   rubrum Novelo \& Philbrick and Marathrum schiedeanum Cham. represent a
   clear example: are these distinct species or morphological variants
   determined by the environment? Three populations were analyzed where we
   carried out intra-population manual cross-pollinations and compared
   these to heterospecific pollinations and open-pollinations (control) to
   test for the presence of reproductive barriers between species. Pollen
   tube development, seed production, seed size, and germination were
   observed in legitimate and heterospecific crosses. Our results indicate
   that there are no reproductive barriers between these species, since we
   did not find differences in abundance and/or distribution of pollen
   tubes among pollination treatments. Significant differences among
   populations in the average number of ovules were found. Similarly, seed
   number differed among pollination treatments. In general, heterospecific
   crosses produced less seeds than manual cross-pollinations and
   open-pollinated flowers. Average seed size was larger for heterospecific
   crosses than manual cross-pollinations and open-pollinations, whereas no
   differences in seed germination among populations or pollination
   treatments were detected. The results support the hypothesis that these
   `species' constitute morphological variants of the same species. These
   results are consistent with the proposal that M. rubrum and M.
   schiedeanum are conspecific with the more widespread Mesoamerican
   species Marathrum foeniculaceum Bonpl. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In this article we answer some questions related to monotonically

   (2009) {[}17], and V.V. Tkachuk (2012) {[}18]. We prove: (1) C-p(C-p(X))
   is monotonically monolithic if and only if X is monotonically
   monolithic: (2) if X is a Sigma(kappa)-product of a family of spaces
   with countable network weight, then C-p(X) is monotonically monolithic:
   (3) if X is the product of Lindelof Sigma-spaces, then C-p(X) is
   monotonically monolithic: (4) if C-p(X) is monotonically monolithic and
   Y is a cozero subset of X, then C-p(Y) is monotonically monolithic: (5)
   every compact omega-monotonically monolithic space is monotonically
   monolithic.
   Moreover, we introduce the notion of monotonically <kappa-monolithic
   space and prove that any of these spaces X with nw(X) = kappa is
   hereditarily D. Finally, we prove that for every pseudocompact space X
   with network weight less or equal to omega(1), C-p(X) is hereditarily D.

Abstract = {Mixed-species bird flocks are a prevalent characteristic of Andean avian
   communities. We describe the species composition of mixed-species bird
   flocks observed in a high mountain zone (3,000 to 3,450 m) of Quindio,
   central Andes, Colombia. The total number of species observed in
   mixed-species flocks was 42, and the mean number of species and
   individuals per flock were 5.1 and 11.5, respectively. Flock species
   composition was similar along the elevation gradient studied. Our
   observations suggest that five species (Margarornis squamiger,
   Iridisornis rufivertex, Conirostrum sitticolor, Mecocerculus
   stictopterus, and Diglossa cyanea) could be nuclear species in the
   flocks. Received 11 August 2011. Accepted 7 February 2012.},

Title = {EDAPHIC AND SEASONAL HETEROGENEITY OF SEED BANKS IN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS
   OF A TROPICAL DRY FOREST REGION IN SOUTHERN MEXICO},
Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The slash-and-burn agriculture practiced across tropical dry regions
   results in the elimination of native vegetation. Upon field abandonment,
   the seed bank becomes a potentially important mechanism of natural
   regeneration at early successional stages. Soil properties and climate
   seasonality may affect seed bank characteristics, thus we analyzed the
   effects of these two factors on seed bank density and composition in
   agricultural fields of a seasonally dry tropical region of southern
   Mexico. Soil cores were collected for the rainy and the dry seasons in
   order to assess changes occurring in the seed bank from the time of
   harvest to the moment when succession could potentially start (the next
   rainy season). The 12 studied fields comprised three different soil
   types recognized by local inhabitants: sandy and stony, silty, and
   clayey soils, locally known as cascajo, black soil, and red soil,
   respectively. At each field 20 soil cores (8 cm diameter, 4.5 cm depth)
   were collected and mixed to form four pooled samples, which were placed
   in a greenhouse to induce germination. A total of 4,422 seedlings (2,291
   seeds m(-2)) representing 40 species were recorded. The most abundant
   species were, in decreasing order, Melanthera nivea, Rhynchelytrum
   repens, Waltheria indica, Amaranthus scariosus, Digitaria bicornis, and
   Cenchrus pilosus. Herbs were the prevailing growth form (> 80\% of total
   richness). No clear pattern was observed in the seed bank related to
   soil type; however, seed bank characteristics tended to be associated
   with the time of use of the agricultural fields, a variable that was not
   controlled in the study. Seed bank species richness was significantly
   larger in the dry season, and although seed density showed a similar
   trend, it was not significant. The studied seed banks contain no
   elements of the regional primary tropical dry forest, which suggests
   that seed banks in deforested areas cannot guarantee their maintenance
   beyond forested areas.},

Abstract = {The corrected Waterman-Truell model and the Elastodynamic Finite
   Integration Technique were used to analyze the ultrasonic wave
   dispersion in trabecular bones mimicking phantoms. A simple two-phase
   model of the trabecular bone is assumed; the trabeculae structure and
   the bone marrow. The phase velocity for frequencies within the range
   from 400 kHz to 800 kHz were computed for different scatterer arrays
   varying their dimensions and number. The theoretical and numerical
   results were compared to experimental published data, obtained from a
   mimicking phantom composed by a periodic array of nylon shreds
   (trabeculae array) immersed in a water tank. Our results showed an
   excellent consistency when compared to experimental data. The negative
   dispersions of -8.48 m/s/MHz and -9.16 m/s/MHz were computed by the
   multiple scattering method and the numerical approach, respectively,
   where the latter is closer to the experimental dispersion of -12.09
   m/s/MHz. Similar result has been reported in the literature, where the
   dispersion predicted by the Generalized Self-Consistent Method {[}J.

Abstract = {Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a plant considered as a pest in
   the canals of the Xochimilco Protected Natural Area (PNA), nevertheless
   it could be used for phytoremediation. Since phytoremediation is a
   plant-site system specific technology, this study evaluated the
   potential use of water hyacinth as an accumulating plant for metals in
   the Xochimilco canals. For this purpose, we performed statistical
   analyses comparing the metal concentrations in the roots and shoots;
   also we calculated the translocation and bioaccumulation coefficients.
   We collected water hyacinth in tourist, agricultural and urban activity
   areas. After the acid digestion of samples, we quantified the
   concentration of 14 metals and a metalloid (As) in the areal and
   underwater structure of the plant using ICP-MS, ICP-OES and GF-AAS
   techniques. The underwater structure accumulated higher concentrations
   of metals than the shoots, except Sr. Bioaccumulation coefficients
   showed that water hyacinth from Xochimilco could be used as a remedial
   plant for metals, however it must be periodically removed from the
   canals. Furthermore, statistical cluster analysis showed that
   urban-influenced site (El Potrero) is the most polluted with metals.},

Abstract = {A bioclimatic modeling of the tree Ternstroemia lineata DC.
   (Ternstroemiaceae) was undertaken. The genus itself is considered as
   diagnostic or characteristic of the Mexican cloud forest. Ternstroemia
   lineata has the broadest distribution of all species in this family in
   Mexico and northern Central America. This species consists of two
   subspecies, T. lineata subsp. lineata and T. lineata subsp. chalicophila
   (Loes.) B. M. Barthol. Ecological niche models for both subspecies were
   generated using the genetic algorithm for rule-set production method.
   The ecological models for the years 2020, 2050, and 2080 were obtained
   under the effects of global climatic change considering two emission
   scenarios (A2a and B2a). When climatic change values were introduced,
   the ecological niche representation for both subspecies contracted in
   such a way that they became almost lost throughout their entire
   geographical range. In both cases, predictions for all years in both
   scenarios contracted more than 90\%. This species may not be able to
   adapt to modifications caused by climatic change to future conditions,
   so it is at risk of extinction in the immediate future.},

Volume = {167},
Pages = {16-25},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We propose a biochemical model providing the kinetic and energetic
   descriptions of the processivity dynamics of kinesin and dinein
   molecular motors. Our approach is a modified version of a well known
   model describing kinesin dynamics and considers the presence of a
   competitive inhibition reaction by ADP. We first reconstruct a
   continuous free-energy landscape of the cycle catalyst process that
   allows us to calculate the number of steps given by a single molecular
   motor. Then, we calculate an analytical expression associated to the
   translational velocity and the stopping time of the molecular motor in
   terms of time and ATP concentration. An energetic interpretation of
   motor processivity is discussed in quantitative form by using
   experimental data. We also predict a time duration of collective
   processes that agrees with experimental reports. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   famafa, N. fantara, N. farihy, N. gamela, N. lakana, N. mamba, N. saka,
   N. tany, and N. tsiba. Tolegnaro includes two new species: T sagani and
   T. kepleri. A phylogenetic data matrix of 436 terminals and 341
   morphological characters was extracted from the Goblin Spider Planetary
   Biodiversity Inventory (PBI) descriptive database. The monophyly of
   Noideattella and Tolegnaro was tested in a phylogenetic analysis of this
   matrix. In this analysis other oonopid genera recently revised were also
   recovered as monophyletic and with high support values. A key for all
   species described here is provided. Noideattella species can be
   differentiated by having the pars cephalica strongly elevated in lateral
   view, forming a posterior cone, tibia and metatarsi with spines, and
   abdomen completely covered by scuta. Tolegnaro species in addition
   present plumose seta around the pedicel area.},

Abstract = {Let tau and gamma be infinite cardinal numbers with tau <= gamma. A
   subset Y of a space X is called C-tau-compact if f vertical bar Y
   vertical bar is compact for every continuous function f : X -> R-tau. We
   prove that every C-tau-compact dense subspace of a product of gamma
   non-trivial compact spaces each of them of weight <= tau is
   2(tau)-resolvable. In particular, every pseudocompact dense subspace of
   a product of non-trivial metrizable compact spaces is c-resolvable. As a
   consequence of this fact we obtain that there is no sigma-independent
   maximal independent family. Also, we present a consistent example,
   relative to the existence of a measurable cardinal, of a dense
   pseudocompact subspace of \{0, 1\}(2 lambda), with lambda = 2(omega 1),
   which is not maximally resolvable. Moreover, we improve a result by W.
   Hu (2006) {[}17] by showing that if maximal theta-independent families
   do not exist, then every dense subset of square(theta) \{0, 1\}(gamma)
   is omega-resolvable for a regular cardinal number theta with omega(1) <=
   theta <= gamma. Finally, if there are no maximal independent families on
   kappa of cardinality gamma, then every Baire dense subset of
   \{0,1\}(gamma) of cardinality <= kappa and every Baire dense subset of
   {[}0, 1](gamma) of cardinality <= kappa are omega-resolvable. (c) 2011

Abstract = {New fauna of gastropods and bivalves colleted in outcrops of Tuzancoa
   Formation, near Otlamalacatla town, northeast of Hidalgo state, are
   described. The specimens are preserved like imperfect moulds with some
   deformation that limit the precise taxonomic determination. However, it
   is possible to report the presence of five species of gastropods from
   the families Bellerophontidae, Omphalotrochidae, Eotomariidae,
   Naticopsidae and Soleniscidae, and 20 species of pelecypods from the
   families Nuculidae, Mytilidae, Myalinidae, Plerineidae, Bakevellidae,
   Euchondriidae, Aviculopectinidae, Deltopectinidae, Chaenocardiidae,
   Streblochondriidae, Heteropectinidae, Acanthopectinidae, Limidae,
   Schizodidae, Trigoniidae, Astartidae, Sanguinolitidae and
   Solenomorphidae; most of these species are reported for the first time
   in Mexico. The principal affinities of this fauna are found in West
   Texas and belong to earlier Permian (Cisuralian) of Grandian province.},

Volume = {85},

Abstract = {Fog is a factor that affects deeply the structure of vegetation of
   coastal deserts. Guadalupe is an oceanic island located 260 km off the
   coast of Baja California, and is one of the few places of the Sonoran
   Desert coasts with scarped coastal topography and frequent fog. With the
   aim to identify the effect of fog on the community of the palm forest
   (palmar) of Brahea edulis located in the northern tip of the island: (1)
   we analyzed the richness and composition of vascular plants in the
   palmar compared to the remainder of the island, and (2) we analyzed the
   altitudinal variation of the abundance of palms, herbs and mosses to
   identify if there is altitudinal variation of the vegetation. Although
   species composition was not different between palmar and the rest of
   island, species richness and vascular plant cover were greater in the
   palmar. On the other hand, we found a clear altitudinal zonation of the
   vegetation in the palmar that is similar to that found in South American
   fog-driven plant communities such as the lomas. Thus, the palmar
   community of Guadalupe Island may be considered as a fog oasis, one of
   the very few that occur in North America.},

Abstract = {We investigated the diversity of a denitrifying gene (nirK) and the
   emission of CO2 and N2O, in a ``chinampa{''} soil contaminated with
   methyl parathion. Soil at 40\% of water holding capacity was spiked with
   methyl parathion at four concentration:; (i.e. 0, 0.7, 1.47 and 4.27 g
   kg(-1) dry soil), while emission of N2O and CO2 and nirK diversity was
   determined after 0, 1, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days. The emission of N2O on a
   daily base and the cumulative emission of CO2 was not affected by the
   different concentrations of methyl parathion applied to soil. The
   diversity of the nirK gene, determined by using temperature gradient gel
   electrophoresis (TGGE), decreased with increased methyl parathion
   application. It was found that methyl parathion had effect on the
   emissions of N2O and CO2, and reduced the diversity of the nirK gene.
   Consequently, the reduced diversity of the nirK gene could affect the
   emission of N2O. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {First principles electronic structure investigations of the nature of
   adsorption, relaxation of the atoms near the adsorption site, and the
   charging of the Au-2 particle on the relaxed-rumpled MgO(100) surface
   have been carried out within the density functional
   theory-cluster-embedding approach. The investigations focus on an Au-2
   molecule, perpendicular to the surface, adsorbed at different locations.
   Three bonding sites are studied: a five coordinated oxygen regular
   terrace site O5c, an F-s neutral color center (two electrons in an O
   vacancy), and an F-s(+) positive charged color center (one electron in
   an O vacancy). The studies indicate that large relaxation of the
   neighboring atoms and large charge transfer occurs for an Au-2 over the
   color centers. An analysis of the one-electron energy levels of the Au
   dimer, the MgO surface and the Au2MgO(100) complex for each absorption
   site allows us to rationalize the nature of the bonding, surface
   relaxation, calculated absorption and dimerization energies and electron
   charge transfers.},

Abstract = {Several authors have discussed whether Peromyscus furvus is a monotypic
   species rather than a polytypic entity, that it includes more than one
   species. Here, we analyze these questions by means of traditional
   morphometrics and by genetic analyses using ND3-ND4 mtDNA genes as
   markers. In spite of a generalized overlap of the measurable characters
   among populations, our analyses show that the northernmost populations,
   which was assignable to P. latirostris, consistently show larger
   dimensions overall. The amount of genetic differentiation revealed by
   our molecular data, support conclusive evidence to suggest this taxon is
   a valid species. Our results also disclose that morphometric and
   molecular segregation between P. furvus and P. angustirostris is still
   incomplete. Finally, the two populations from the state of Oaxaca showed
   more morphometric affinity with those attributable to P. furvus and
   revealed a discrete degree of genetic differentiation. Nevertheless,
   their systematic position is not clear yet. (C) 2011 Deutsche

Abstract = {It has been proposed that at moderate concentrations, reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) play an important role as regulatory mediators in
   signaling processes. Many of the ROS-mediated responses, such as those
   mediated by the glutathione (GSH) system, protect cells against
   oxidative stress and reestablish redox homeostasis. The response to
   stress is controlled by specific transcription factors, such as
   hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which interacts with chaperones such
   as heat shock proteins (HSP) that stabilize intracellular components. We
   have reported that the oxidation produced by extreme light cycles was
   coupled to cellular fluctuations in the production of free radicals and
   ROS in crayfish. Herein, we investigated whether ROS resulting from
   lightdark cycles (20:4 LD) with a long photoperiod activated HIF-1a in
   the putative pacemakers of crayfish. Our results indicate that both the
   light resulting from equatorial and extreme daily light cycles and the
   constant darkness-induced HIF-1a and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)
   appeared to regulate each other. The interaction between these proteins
   and the ability of crayfish to shift from the oxidative to glycolytic
   pathways, thereby synchronizing to extreme illumination conditions and
   maintaining a rhythmic predictive relationship with the environment,
   suggest HIF-1 as a key factor in these rhythmic metabolic interactions.},

Abstract = {Basic demographic information for turtles in tropical and sub-tropical
   regions is still scarce. As a consequence, prospective management and
   conservation plans for these long-lived vertebrates lack the necessary
   quantitative background for successful implementation. In this study, we
   used capture mark recapture techniques in two populations of the Mexican
   mud turtle (Kinosternon integrum) located at different elevations in
   central Mexico. We estimated stage-specific survival, growth, and
   fecundity rates and constructed a population projection matrix for each
   population. In the low-elevation population, the finite rate of
   population growth (lambda) was not significantly different from unity,
   indicating demographic stability. In the high-elevation population,
   lambda was significantly lower than unity, indicating population
   decline. Survival of adults was the vital rate that contributed most to
   population persistence in both populations. We discuss our results in
   the context of demographic patterns of turtle species, emphasizing the
   differences between the two populations studied and potential
   conservation implications.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},

Volume = {79},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1029-1046},

Abstract = {In viviparous organisms, pregnant females typically experience an
   increase in body mass and body volume. In this study, the prediction
   that variation in reproductive traits among populations of viviparous
   organisms should be related to variation among populations in body shape
   was tested in the Pacific molly Poecilia butleri, a viviparous fish that
   inhabits western Mexico and northern Central America. Variation among 10
   populations in four reproductive traits was examined: brood size,
   individual embryo mass, total reproductive allotment and degree of
   maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing embryos. Variation
   among these populations in body shape was also examined. Significant
   variation among populations was observed in both brood size and
   reproductive allotment but not in embryo mass or degree of maternal
   provisioning. Significant variation among populations was also observed
   in body shape. After correcting for female size, however, reproductive
   traits and body shape were not associated among populations. This
   suggests that selective pressures acting on reproduction do not
   necessarily affect morphology and vice versa. Several factors might
   contribute to this unexpected lack of association between reproductive
   traits and morphology. (C) 2011 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology (C)

Abstract = {The influence of climatic variables on the distribution of 15 species of
   Bursera in Morelos Mexico, was analyzed. Data on the presence of species
   and climatic variables from 47 meteorological stations were obtained,
   and maps of actual and potential distribution were made using a GIS; the
   influence of the main climatic variables on the distribution was
   analyzed by principal component and cluster analyses. The species of
   Bursera are found in an altitudinal range of 800-2 800 m; species
   richness is higher in the warm, relatively dry areas south of the state.
   Two main groups of species were distinguished: a), those having a
   restricted distribution, found mainly in warm sites and, b), those
   having a wider distribution, including relatively cool sites.
   Precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, evapotranspiration and
   its seasonality, all influenced the distribution of the species. Bursera
   bicolor, B. bipinnata, B. cuneata, B. copallifera, B. fagaroides, B.
   grandifolia and B. glabrifolia are found on sites having a relatively
   low minimum temperature (5-10 degrees C) and high precipitation, while
   B. aptera, B. ariensis, B. lancifolia, B. linanoe, B. longipes, B.
   tnorelensis, B. schlechtendalii and B. submoniliformis are found in
   areas experiencing higher minimum temperatures (>= 14 degrees C) and

Abstract = {Large amounts of methyl parathion are used to control pests on crops
   when cultivated in chinampa soils of Mexico City. The effect of adding
   methyl parathion on soil characteristics, CO2 emissions, mineral N and
   4-nitrophenol, a degradation product of methyl parathion, and the
   degradation of methyl parathion, was investigated in an aerobic
   incubation experiment. Treatments were sterilized and non-sterilized
   soil amended with or without methyl parathion at 280 mg kg(-1), a
   concentration sometimes found in the top soil. Methyl parathion removal
   followed a first-order kinetic with a half-life ranging from 16 to 34
   days, while small amounts of 4-nitrophenol were detected after three
   days. No abiotic processes affected the methyl parathion concentration
   and no 4-nitrophenol was formed in the sterilized soil. It was found
   that methyl parathion was removed rapidly from soil and less than 35 mu
   g kg(-1) 4-nitrophenol was found in soil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Title = {Time-place learning is altered by perinatal low-protein malnutrition in

Abstract = {Malnutrition produces changes in the central nervous system (CNS) of
   mammals during development, related to the intensity and timing of the
   malnutrition insult during the pre- or postnatal period. Protein
   malnutrition produces irreversible changes in hippocampal formation and
   some brain stem nuclei. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is
   dramatically altered by low-protein diets during the gestational and
   perinatal periods. Also, it is known that circadian oscillators regulate
   physiological, behavioral, and cognitive processes and there is evidence
   that the time-place learning process exhibits a daily temporal
   distribution. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of
   chronic, prenatal, or postnatal malnutrition on daily patterns of the
   time-place learning process in the adult rat. Forty Sprague-Dawley male
   90-day-old rats, were divided into four groups: 10 well nourished
   controls (Co), 10 chronically (CM), 10 prenatally malnourished (PrM),
   and 10 postnatally malnourished (PtM) rats. Efficiency in time-place
   learning was tested by using a behavioral T-maze. Each rat was assayed
   for 10 trials before considering the final probe of efficiency. Each
   trial was 60 seconds long, final efficiency was measured by the amount
   of time the rat took to reach the end of an arm containing a water pot.
   Each rat was tested in 2-hour spans until completion of a full 24-hour
   cycle. A Cosinor analysis was used to evaluate acrophase and percentage
   of rhythmicity. The obtained results suggest that time-place learning
   process is influenced by the circadian clock. The severity and timing of
   prenatal or chronic protein malnutrition modifies the acrophase and
   rhythmicity of the learning circadian pattern, which can impact
   important cognitive functions.},

Abstract = {Cacti are thought to be highly vulnerable to chronic anthropogenic
   disturbance (CAD). To assess its effects, we modeled the dynamics of
   three populations of the endangered cactus Coryphantha werdermannii
   exposed to different intensities of disturbance. Because no seedlings
   germinated and survived in the less-disturbed site, we analyzed two
   different scenarios: If the same, average germination probability was
   used for all sites, the population growth rates (lambda) decreased with
   disturbance, but lambda remained unchanged if a very low germination
   probability was assigned to the less-disturbed site and the observed
   probabilities were used for the remaining populations. Retrospective
   analysis showed that different demographic processes affected lambda as
   a result of increasing disturbance: The unsuccessful establishment of
   seedlings in the preserved site diminished lambda. The damage caused by
   livestock to reproductive structures in the site with intermediate
   disturbance was responsible for a reduction in lambda. In the most
   disturbed site, the reduced individual growth rates that seemingly
   resulted from land degradation caused a decrease in lambda. No simple
   management strategy can be proposed because different threats require
   attention depending on disturbance intensity. CAD had both positive and
   negative effects on lambda, conferring this species with a certain
   degree of tolerance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the spatio-temporal dynamics of a
   pollinator-plant-herbivore mathematical model. The full model consists
   of three nonlinear reaction-diffusion-advection equations defined on a
   rectangular region. In view of analyzing the full model, we firstly
   consider the temporal dynamics of three homogeneous cases. The first one
   is a model for a mutualistic interaction (pollinator-plant), later on a
   sort of predator-prey (plant-herbivore) interaction model is studied. In
   both cases, the interaction term is described by a Holling response of
   type II. Finally, by considering that the plant population is the unique
   feeding source for the herbivores, a mathematical model for the three
   interacting populations is considered. By incorporating a constant
   diffusion term into the equations for the pollinators and herbivores, we
   numerically study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the first two mentioned
   models. For the full model, a constant diffusion and advection terms are
   included in the equation for the pollinators. For the resulting model,
   we sketch the proof of the existence, positiveness, and boundedness of
   solution for an initial and boundary values problem. In order to see the
   separated effect of the diffusion and advection terms on the final
   population distributions, a set of numerical simulations are included.
   We used homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.},

Abstract = {Both females and males may suffer from increased mortality risk as a
   result of the activities and physiological processes associated with
   reproduction. In this study I estimated sex-specific reproductive costs
   in the survival rates of a viviparous and territorial lizard (Xenosaurus
   grandis grandis), accounting for the potential effects of population
   density, population growth rate and the size of individuals. I used a
   multi-model inference framework to test the following hypotheses: 1)
   female survival rate should decrease when they experience the late
   phases of embryo development and immediately after births take place;
   and 2) male survival rate should decrease when they search and compete
   for potential mates. Capture-mark-recapture data supported the first
   hypothesis but not the second. Female survival appeared to decrease
   right before and after parturition events. In contrast, male survival
   did not decrease during the mating season. I discuss the potential
   causes and implications of this sex-specific trade-off between
   reproduction and survival.},

Abstract = {Serotiny-the retention of seeds in the mother plant for over a year-in
   unpredictable environments may increase the probability that at least
   some seeds are dispersed during favorable periods. Propagules may be
   expelled when environmental cues announcing favorable conditions occur,
   or be gradually released into the environment. This could be a
   bet-hedging strategy increasing the long-term fitness by reducing
   interannual variability in reproduction. However, the impact of seed
   retention on the population dynamics of serotinous species and its
   contribution to fitness has been barely explored under field conditions.
   We assessed these issues in the threatened Mammillaria pectinifera, a
   small globose cactus that gets established only in exceptionally rainy
   years. This species expels some seeds actively during unusually rainy
   periods, while dispersing others passively over several years. Dynamics
   of the seeds in the mother plant over two very contrasting years in
   terms of precipitation was incorporated into a stochastic matrix model.
   Seed retention was found to increase significantly the probability that
   some of the seeds retained in any given year are dispersed within a
   subsequent rainy period. Active seed-expulsion raises this probability
   even further. As expected in bet hedgers, seed retention increased
   fitness in the presence of temporal variability. Active fruit expulsion
   did not affect fitness, but reduced demographic stochasticity. The
   incomplete serotiny and fruit expulsion observed is the evolutionary
   outcome expected for the environment and life-history attributes of the
   species.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the distributional patterns of 66 species of
   leptosporangiate ferns inhabiting in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO),
   Mexico, using grid-cells and endemism index values, parsimony analysis
   of endemicity (PAE) and track analysis. The strict consensus area
   cladogram obtained with PAE showed a polytomy and four main groups or
   clades, two of them including only two or three grid-cells. The largest
   group included grid-cells located along the SMO, mainly in the
   central-southern portions of the SMO; a second group was located at the
   southern portion of the SMO in the leeward zone of this mountain chain.
   The track analysis of the fern taxa allowed us to recognize five
   generalized tracks in the SMO and their convergence showed five nodes.
   With endemism index values, 11 grid-cells were identified as important
   areas for ferns, seven of them corresponding to the group 1 of PAE (from
   montane environments), and four grid-cells to the group 2 of PAE (from
   leeward areas of the Sierra Madre Oriental). The results obtained herein
   slightly agree with other published works using other kinds of
   organisms. The analyses used herein serve to generate useful information
   about the biogeographic history of this complex area, and led us to
   support, detect, test and propose areas, important from biogeographic
   viewpoint, for ferns.},

Abstract = {Distribution and diversity of springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola) on the
   altitudinal gradient of a temperate forest in Mexico. Mountain
   ecosystems have shown slow mineralization activity due to weather
   conditions, and to some groups with arthropods with special roles. The
   Collembola is an important group for litter fragmentation, showing
   different distribution patterns. The objective of the present study was
   to determine the diversity of Collembola along a volcano attitudinal
   gradient. For this, four sampling expeditious evaluated four attitudinal
   levels (I=2 753, II=3 015, III=3 250 and IV=3 687 mast) in Iztaccihuatl
   Volcano, from November 2003, and March. June and August 2004. Shannon
   diversity (W). Pielou evenness (J) and Simpson dominance (I/lambda)
   indices were calculated. The similarity between the associations of
   springtails between the sampling sites was evaluated by a cluster
   analysis using the Pearson correlation coefficient, as distance and the
   unpaired arithmetic averages (UPGMA) as amalgamation method. A total of
   24 075 springtails, distributed in 2 families, 46 genera and 86 species
   was collected. The higher species abundance was found at the attitudinal
   Area II. The lowest diversity value was recorded in IV, while the higher
   diversity values were found in III. Significant differences between
   Shannon indices were found between zones II-III (t(001, 187)=4.11, p <
   0.05) and between III-IV (t(0.01, 187)=3.8, p < 0.05) according to
   modified t-test. When considering sampling dates, no significant
   differences were found. The dendrogram showed that in composition the
   level I is more homogeneous throughout the year. In conclusion, a
   statistically significant seasonal variation in springtail abundances
   was not found, but it was observed that, the lower altitude (I) resulted
   more homogeneous along the studied period, followed by level It and III.
   There is a particular assemblage of springtails community in each
   attitudinal area studied; in general, the sites with low slope resulted
   more diverse in Collembola communities. These results show that there
   are important factors such as altitude, vegetation type and microhabitat
   heterogeneity that may affect the distribution of springtails
   communities along an attitudinal gradient. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (1):

Volume = {98},

Abstract = {Premise of the study : Oaks are dominant trees and key species in many
   temperate and subtropical forests in the world. In this study, we
   analyzed patterns of distribution of red oaks (Quercus, section Lobatae)
   occurring in Mexico and Central America to determine areas of species
   richness and endemism to propose areas of conservation.
   Methods : Patterns of richness and endemism of 75 red oak species were
   analyzed using three different units. Two complementarity algorithms
   based on species richness and three algorithms based on species rarity
   were used to identify important areas for conservation. A simulated
   annealing analysis was performed to evaluate and formulate effective new
   reserves for red oaks that are useful for conserving the ecosystems
   associated with them after the systematic conservation planning
   approach.
   Key results : Two main centers of species richness were detected. The
   northern Sierra Madre Oriental and Serranias Meridionales of Jalisco had
   the highest values of endemism. Fourteen areas were considered as
   priorities for conservation of red oak species based on the 26 priority
   political entities, 11 floristic units and the priority grid-cells
   obtained in the complementarity analysis. In the present network of
   Natural Protected Areas in Mexico and Central America, only 41.3\% (31
   species) of the red oak species are protected. The simulated annealing
   analysis indicated that to protect all 75 species of red oaks, 12
   current natural protected areas need to be expanded by 120 000 ha of
   additional land, and 26 new natural protected areas with 512 500 ha need
   to be created.
   Conclusions : Red oaks are a useful model to identify areas for
   conservation based on species richness and endemism as a result of their
   wide geographic distribution and a high number of species. We evaluated
   and reformulated new reserves for red oaks that are also useful for the
   conservation of ecosystems associated with them.},

   diversity and distribution},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},

Pages = {281-291},
Abstract = {The Mexican Pacific Ocean, defined as east of 122 degrees W and from 12
   to 34 degrees N, encompasses an oceanographic transition zone with
   dynamic population and community processes. In order to gain insight
   into possible marine mammal ecological responses to the current rapid
   environmental changes, we compiled and analyzed data from 11 145 marine
   mammal sightings made between 1981 and 2008 by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California
   Sur, and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. In 2 x 2 degrees
   cells, we computed alpha and beta diversities in terms of species
   richness, commonness as the occurrence of species among years,
   tropicality as the proportion of tropical species, and degree of threat
   according to the IUCN Red List. Current marine mammal distributions seem
   to derive from a postglacial northwards expansion of tropical pelagic
   species and a retention of upwelling-rich tropical and subtropical
   habitats nearshore by antitropical species. Analysis of commonness
   indicates that species distributions and thus biogeographic boundaries
   are dynamic, since marine mammals transit large distances, especially
   around southern Baja California. Analysis of beta diversity showed a
   considerable degree of spatial heterogeneity, but without well-defined
   regions. The species at risk are concentrated in the northern Gulf of
   California, but also occur off Pacific Baja California, Jalisco, and
   Guerrero coasts. The Gulf of California could be considered a refuge of
   global value for these animals.},

Abstract = {We present a review on the conservation status and population trends of

   analyses on the information gathered by the International Union for the

   well as on available literature about imminent or potential threats to
   these organisms in Mexico. This country has the fifth largest amphibian
   fauna in the world and almost 58\% of the species that inhabit this
   country are considered as threatened. We highlight the proportion of
   species per order, family, and genus that are currently under severe
   risk in Mexico. In addition, we prepared a detailed list of the main
   factors that are threatening amphibians in this country. Evidence is
   provided that the six main mechanisms that are globally leading
   amphibians to extinction (alien species, over-exploitation, land use
   change, global changes, pollution, and infectious diseases) are indeed
   currently operating in Mexico. We discuss the relative importance of
   each of these causes. We also highlight the paucity of quantitative
   studies that support the current conservation status of Mexican
   amphibian species.},

Abstract = {The high performance of cerium dioxide (CeO2) as support for Au in
   catalysis relies on its ability to anchor Au clusters and transfer
   charge to the gold nanoparticles. These two processes are governed by
   oxygen vacancy formation. To study the localization and the mobility of
   the electrons left behind by the vacancy from the relaxed oxygen, an
   experimental and theoretical study is hereby reported. CeO2 powder was
   synthesized by the polyacrylamide gel method and its microstructure was
   characterized by X-ray diffraction and high resolution scanning electron
   microscopy. We have determined the presence of only the fluorite cubic
   phase in our samples and the formation of acicular particles of similar
   to 1 mu m in length. In the electron spin resonance study, we observed
   that the unpaired electrons are quasi free. A single-line paramagnetic
   signal is observed that exhibits spin characteristics with a g-value of
   2.0039 at room temperature. This compares well to the value of 2.0023
   determined for free electrons. In addition, we have conducted a
   theoretical study using a density functional theory cluster approach and
   calculate the electron spin density of CeO2 clusters. We find that spin
   density clouds are localized around the cerium ions. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {Although the molecular mechanisms that control circadian rhythms in many
   animals, particularly in the fly, are well known, molecular and
   biochemical studies addressing the location and function of the proteins
   and genes contributing to the cycling of the clock in crayfish
   Procambarus clarkii are scarce. In this study, we investigated whether
   three proteins that interact in the feedback loop of the molecular clock
   described for Drosophila are expressed in the putative circadian
   pacemakers of crayfish retina, eyestalk and brain and whether their
   expression cycles in a manner consistent with elements of the circadian
   clock. Here we identified PER, TIM and CLK immunoreactivity in the
   cytoplasm and nucleus of cells located in the retina as well as in
   clusters of cells and neuropils of the optic ganglia, lateral
   protocerebrum and brain. Brain clusters 6, 10, 9 and 11, in particular,
   showed Per, Tim and Clk-like immunoreactivity at the perikarya and
   nucleus, and these antigens colocalized at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 and/or
   ZT 12. A biochemical assay demonstrated circadian functionality of Per,
   Tim and Clk proteins. Both in the eyestalk and in the brain, these
   proteins demonstrated apparent daily and circadian rhythms. The presence
   and colocalization of these clock proteins in the cytoplasm and/or
   nucleus of several cells of retina, optic lobe and brain, depending on
   time, as well as their circadian oscillations, suggest interactions
   between positive and negative transcription factors and clock proteins
   similar to those forming the feedback loop of the canonical model
   proposed for different animals.},

Abstract = {We updated the floristic checklist of the Nizanda region, Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec (southern Mexico), characterized the occurring plant
   communities based on dominant species, and described the region's flora
   according to life form, growth form, growth type, and growth habit
   spectra. Ten years of botanical exploration, along with surveys in 188
   100-m(2) samples from different vegetation types, provided the baseline
   floristic information. Ordination and classification analyses were
   performed to examine the degree of differentiation between communities.
   Geographical ranges of all species were used to assess biogeographical
   relationships of this flora. The inventory includes 920 species (553
   genera, 124 families). More than one-third of the families were
   represented by a single species, whereas the 10 richest families had
   43\% of the species richness. Dendrograms showing plot classification at
   three taxonomic levels (species, genus and family) revealed savannah as
   the most strongly differentiated community amid seven vegetation types.
   Regarding growth forms, forbs and trees prevailed. Phanerophytes were
   the most common life form category, whereas herbs and woody plants were
   the dominant growth types. The largest richness for all taxonomic levels
   was recorded in the tropical dry forest. The expanded floristic
   knowledge gained for the Nizanda region provided better criteria to
   revise the classification scheme of its vegetation. Our preliminary
   biogeographical analysis illustrates the role of the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec as a corridor for thermophilous floras between two oceanic
   watersheds, and as a natural distributional limit for several
   Mesoamerican plant species.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {40},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A completely Lorentz-invariant Bohmian model has been proposed recently
   for the case of a system of non-interacting spinless particles, obeying
   Klein-Gordon equations. It is based on a multi-temporal formalism and on
   the idea of treating the squared norm of the wave function as a
   space-time probability density. The particle's configurations evolve in
   space-time in terms of a parameter sigma with dimensions of time. In
   this work this model is further analyzed and extended to the case of an
   interaction with an external electromagnetic field. The physical meaning
   of sigma is explored. Two special situations are studied in depth: (1)
   the classical limit, where the Einsteinian Mechanics of Special
   Relativity is recovered and the parameter sigma is shown to tend to the
   particle's proper time; and (2) the non-relativistic limit, where it is
   obtained a model very similar to the usual non-relativistic Bohmian
   Mechanics but with the time of the frame of reference replaced by sigma
   as the dynamical temporal parameter.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of a degree of freedom associated to an axial vector in
   contact with a heat bath is described by means of a probability
   distribution function obeying a Fokker-Planck equation. The equation is
   derived by using mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics and permits a
   formulation of a dynamical theory for the axial degree of freedom
   (orientation, polarization) and its associated order parameter. The
   theory is used to describe dielectric relaxation in homogeneous and
   non-homogeneous systems in the presence of strong electric fields. In
   the homogeneous case, we obtain the dependence of the relaxation time on
   the external field as observed in experiments. In the non-homogeneous
   case, our model accounts for the two observed maxima of the dielectric
   loss giving a good quantitative description of experimental data at all
   frequencies, especially for systems with low molecular mass. (C) 2010

Abstract = {In this study, we analyzed the soil microfungal community from a banana
   (Musa paradisiaca L.) plantation in Teapa, a municipality of Tabasco
   State in Mexico. The objectives were to determine the fungal species
   present and to analyze the community composition throughout an entire
   year. We performed 4 samplings during different seasons and the fungal
   isolates were recovered using the dilution plate technique. We isolated
   91 strains from 30 different mitosporic species where only Aspergillus
   flavus Link, Fusarium nivale (Fr.) Ces and Trichoderma harzianum Rifai
   were considered as resident species while the remaining species were
   sporadic. The Sorensen similarity index suggested that species
   succession had occurred among the sampling seasons. From all the species
   identified in this survey, 8 had not been found as inhabitants of
   Mexican soils. The study shows the high microfungal richess of this soil
   and highlights the importance of Mexican soils as sources of mitosporic
   fungal species.},

Abstract = {The gregarious behavior of individuals of populations is an important
   factor in avoiding predators or for reproduction. Here, by using a
   random biased walk approach, we build a model which, after a
   transformation, takes the general form u(t) = {[}D(u)u(x)](x) + g( u).
   The model involves a density-dependent non-linear diffusion coefficient
   D whose sign changes as the population density u increases. For negative
   values of D aggregation occurs, while dispersion occurs for positive
   values of D. We deal with a family of degenerate negative diffusion
   equations with logistic-like growth rate g. We study the one-dimensional
   traveling wave dynamics for these equations and illustrate our results
   with a couple of examples. A discussion of the ill-posedness of the
   partial differential equation problem is included.},

Title = {DEMOGRAPHY OF A KNOB-SCALED LIZARD IN NORTHEASTERN QUERETARO, MEXICO},

Abstract = {Demographic data are essential to determine the probability that species
   will persist over time. Unfortunately, demographic studies are rarely
   part of the initial evaluation of potentially threatened or endangered
   species. Here, we studied the population dynamics of a poorly known
   knob-scaled lizard species (Xenosaurus sp.) from Mexico with the use of
   a population matrix modeling approach. We measured annual fecundity and
   survival over three consecutive years (2001-2004) and used these data to
   generate transition matrices. From these matrices we estimated annual
   variability in finite population growth rate (lambda), stable stage
   structure, and the relative importance of the life-cycle components for
   lambda (elasticity values). In 2 of the 3 yr population growth rates
   indicated a tendency toward population increase (lambda(01-02) = 1.20
   and lambda(02-03) = 1.14), whereas in 1 of the 3 yr population growth
   rate indicated population decrease (lambda(03-04) = 0.78). The negative
   population trend observed during 2003-2004 was explained by warmer and
   drier environmental conditions that caused the lowest observed survival
   rates in all size classes. We examined this annual demographic
   variability using stochastic simulations. This allowed us to project
   population trends under hypothetical scenarios with increasing frequency
   of unfavorable years, manifest through reduced survival, fecundity, or
   both. Our simulations revealed that small increases in the frequency of
   harsh annual conditions vastly increased extinction risk in this
   species. Given the highly restricted geographic distribution of this
   species mid its susceptibility to extinction, we recommend that it be
   given a high priority for conservation.},

Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics is used to formulate a model
   describing nonhomogeneous and non-Debye dielectric relaxation. The model
   is presented in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability
   distribution of noninteracting polar molecules in contact with a heat
   bath and in the presence of an external time-dependent electric field.
   Memory effects are introduced in the Fokker-Planck description through
   integral relations containing memory kernels, which in turn are used to
   establish a connection with fractional Fokker-Planck descriptions. The
   model is developed in terms of the evolution equations for the first two
   moments of the distribution function. These equations are solved by
   following a perturbative method from which the expressions for the
   complex susceptibilities are obtained as a function of the frequency and
   the wave number. Different memory kernels are considered and used to
   compare with experiments of dielectric relaxation in glassy systems. For
   the case of Cole-Cole relaxation, we infer the distribution of
   relaxation times and its relation with an effective distribution of
   dipolar moments that can be attributed to different segmental motions of
   the polymer chains in a melt. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {A population of the river shrimp Potimirim mexicana from the Maquinas
   River in Veracruz, Mexico, was analyzed. The pattern of size
   distribution by sex in this species suggests that it is a sequential
   hermaphrodite. A discriminant analysis method applied to establish the
   subgroups that are part or the population showed the existence of 3
   classes: sexually undifferentiated organisms, males and females. Within
   the male subgroup 3 types or organisms were established depending on the
   length of the appendix masculina. With this analysis it is confirmed
   that P. mexicana is a species with sequential hermaphroditism.},

Title = {UV-B radiation severely affects embryo development in the Mexican
   axolotl},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-318},
Abstract = {Amphibians are greatly affected by diversity loss and recent declines in
   amphibian populations are well documented. One of the proposed causes of
   such declines, UV-B radiation, has been reported to induce lethal and
   sub-lethal effects on different ontogenetic phases of development. Of
   these phases, the embryo stage is likely the most vulnerable. We used an
   experimental approach to test for the effects of UV-B radiation on
   embryo development of the Mexican axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum.
   Recently, its natural populations experienced a 60\% decline. We
   conducted experimental trials over the course of a year in which we
   exposed A. mexicanum eggs to 3 different treatments of varying UV-B ray
   intensities. Our results indicate that environmental UV-B radiation in
   Mexico City adversely affects the embryos of the Mexican axolotl at
   particular times of the year. The embryos exposed to 100\% UV-B
   radiation had strikingly more deformities (mostly blisters and edemas),
   shorter periods of embryonic development, smaller hatchling size, and
   experienced increased mortality in comparison with embryos that were
   partially or totally protected from UV-B rays. The breeding season of A.
   mexicanum coincides with the time of the year in which the effects of
   UV-B radiation are most harmful (February through April). The observed
   negative effects of UV-B rays could act synergistically with chemical
   pollutants, exotic species, and pathogens to yield the negative
   population trends currently observed in this endemic Mexican amphibian.

   of the base map f provided that X is a graph. In this note we describe a
   continuum X and a continuous map f : X -> X where the density of
   periodic points of the induced map 2f does not imply the density of
   periodic points of the base map f. Also we study a condition of f
   equivalent to the density of periodic points of 2(f)},

Abstract = {Asteraceae is one of the largest families of Angiospermae, and contains
   the Mikania genus. Several species of this family contain polyacetylenic
   and thiophenic compounds which are used as taxonomic markers. Also,
   their phototoxic activity acts as plant defense mechanism. In this paper
   we report the absence of these compounds in Mikania micrantha. We also
   describe the composition of the volatile oil from the seeds and
   inflorescence in the species. Linalool and alpha-pinene were the main
   components of this M. micrantha's essential oil. This study tested the
   ability of extracts of Mikania micrantha to inhibit the mouse ear
   inflammation in response to topical application of
   12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The antibacterial activity
   of extracts was also evaluated against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia
   coli. Ethyl acetate extracts of this plant exhibited significant
   antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, it could be
   used as a medicinal plant.},

Title = {Species-specific disturbance tolerance, competition and positive
   interactions along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1027-1040},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Question
   As it has been found that stress promotes positive interactions mediated
   by physical amelioration of the environment, is it possible that
   interactions may turn positive with increasing chronic anthropogenic
   disturbance (CAD) intensity? Also, is it possible that species that do
   not tolerate disturbance may require environmental amelioration by their
   neighbours in disturbed areas, whereas tolerant species may not?
   Location
   The semi-arid grassland in Concepcion Buenavista, Oaxaca, southern
   Mexico.
   Methods
   We assessed interaction intensity and importance through a neighbour
   removal experiment along a CAD gradient for three species differing in
   disturbance tolerance. Water potential was monitored on vegetated and
   bare soil.
   Results
   A shift from competitive effects in low CAD sites to positive
   interactions in degraded sites was found. The disturbance-tolerant
   species did not respond to CAD, whereas the less tolerant species
   changed its interactions drastically in terms of growth and
   reproduction. The species with medium tolerance had an intermediate
   response. Neighbours promoted germination in all species. Vegetation
   removal reduced soil humidity.
   Conclusions
   Positive interactions seemingly resulted from the amelioration of the
   abiotic stresses induced by vegetation removal. The dependence on
   neighbours to germinate, grow, or reproduce suggests that if CAD
   eliminates the plant cover, vegetation will hardly recover. Irreversible
   changes are known to occur in communities where positive interactions
   predominate, but CAD may set the conditions for irreversible shifts even
   in communities where interactions are normally competitive.},

Abstract = {This paper presents two extensions of the second order polymorphic
   lambda calculus, system F, with monotone (co) inductive types supporting
   (co) iteration, primitive (co) recursion and inversion principles as
   primitives. One extension is inspired by the usual categorical approach
   to programming by means of initial algebras and final coalgebras;
   whereas the other models dialgebras, and can be seen as an extension of
   Hagino's categorical lambda calculus within the framework of parametric
   polymorphism. The systems are presented in Curry-style, and are proven
   to be terminating and type-preserving. Moreover their expressiveness is
   shown by means of several programming examples, going from usual data
   types to lazy codata types such as streams or infinite trees.},

Title = {Identifying the impacts of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on two
   threatened cacti to provide guidelines for population-dynamics
   restoration},

Abstract = {Species frequently have to be preserved in disturbed areas. Restoring
   their predisturbance population dynamics may increase their population
   growth rate (lambda) while preventing the development of vulnerable
   genetic- or age-structures in the population. We assessed how population
   dynamics have been affected by anthropogenic disturbance in the
   threatened cacti Mammillaria dixanthocentron and Mammillaria
   hernandezii. We worked in areas exposed to different intensities of
   disturbance, and applied a retrospective analysis to detect which of the
   vital rates affected by disturbance were responsible for reductions in
   lambda. M. dixanthocentron had lower lambda s in more disturbed
   conditions as a consequence of the reduced survival of adults because of
   livestock trampling and increased predation by hares. M. hernandezii had
   significantly higher lambda s with intermediate disturbance. The
   reduction in lambda under intense disturbance resulted from reduced
   reproduction and adult plant mortality. The death of these individuals
   seemingly was associated to the change in soil conditions due to
   overgrazing. However, the factor with the greatest influence over both
   species was temporal variability, which interacted with disturbance
   sometimes increasing its negative effects. The identification of
   hypothetical mechanisms reducing lambda was facilitated by the
   retrospective analysis, which is then a valuable heuristic tool guiding
   research. As long as they are not properly tested, these hypotheses
   should be considered carefully in management plans, but they may provide
   timely information. Retrospective analysis allows taking initial
   conservation measures, while suggesting guidelines for future research
   that may improve such measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   confirmed the presence of tetrasporophytic and gametophytic thalli in
   populations, proving that the Polysiphonia type of the alternation of
   generations cycle was present at least one period within the annual
   cycle. The results establish a variation of the chromosome number of 3,
   4 and 5 chromosomes in the tetrasporophyte whose modal number was 2n = 4
   chromosomes, and a variation of 1, 2 and 3 chromosomes in the
   gametophyte (modal number n = 2). Chromosome values were found in the

   time in the freshwater green algal flora from Mexico. Physical and
   chemical water quality data were also recorded in the investigated
   environments. All taxa were found at high temperatures (22-28 degrees
   C), neutral to moderately alkaline waters (pH 7-8) with high ionic
   content (total dissolved solids 593-1884 mg l(-1), specific conductance
   826-1952 mu S cm(-1)), with sulfate-bicarbonate/calcium as dominant
   ions. The populations were associated with slow current velocity (<= 30
   cm s(-1)), shallow water depth (<= 41 cm) and silt to sand substratum
   with high organic matter content. The taxa were found in a wide range of
   incident radiation (340-2234 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), except for N.
   farcata var. sieberi which was found in shady sites (24 mu mol photons
   m(-2) s(-1)). All the populations investigated were found in mesotrophic

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the species composition and
   functional groups of ants in nonagricultural (NA) and in irrigated areas
   (S, seasonal irrigation; P, irrigation with well water; W, irrigation
   with wastewater) in an and agricultural region in central Mexico,
   throughout 2005 and 2006. A total of 52,358 ants belonging to 6
   subfamilies, 21 genera and 39 species was collected using pitfall traps.
   The species best represented in all plots were: Forelius pruinosus,
   Pheidole obtusospinosa, Monomorium minimum and Dorymyrmex spp. NA plots
   recorded the highest density of ants. The highest values for diversity
   (H') and equitativity (P) were recorded in NA and P plots, while the
   lowest were recorded in W plots. Cluster analysis showed two different
   groups regarding species composition: NA-S and W-P. Functional groups
   recorded were: dominant Dolichoderinae, three species; subordinate
   Camponotini, five species; hot climate specialists, three species;
   tropical climate specialists, seven species; cold climate specialists,
   five species; cryptic species, one species; opportunists, six species;
   generalized Myrmicinae, nine species. Agricultural activity affects the
   structure of the ant community with epiedaphic forage, and the constant
   use of irrigation wastewater in conjunction with intense agricultural
   practices has negative effect upon species richness of epiedaphic ants.},

Abstract = {The morphology and phenology of a monoecious population of Sirodotia
   suecica Kylin was evaluated seasonally in a central Mexican fifth-order
   high-altitude stream. Abundance of gametophytes is positively correlated
   with concentrations of total dissolved solids, specific conductivity and
   total ionic concentration; being present the whole dry season and
   disappearing in the rainy season. The gametophytes grew in eutrophic
   circumstances and particular microhabitat conditions: high current
   velocity (66-122 cm s(-1)), low irradiance (75-263 mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)) and shallow depth (7-26 cm). Percent cover of gametophytes ranged
   from 5-90\% and significant differences in abundance were not observed
   when alga was present. Some morphological and reproductive
   characteristics seem to be adaptations to high current velocity:
   abundant secondary branches, spermatangia and carpogonia. `Chantransia'
   stage, microscopic creeping filaments associated with the base of the
   gametophyte, were not observed in natural conditions. In terms of
   reproductive success, the population studied can be regarded as highly
   efficient, considering the high fertilized carpogonia rate, similar to
   monoecious populations in lotic habitats. However S. suecica was not
   common in the study region because it was restricted to particular
   microhabitat conditions.},

Title = {FLORISTIC DIFFERENTIATION IN LIMESTONE OUTCROPS OF SOUTHERN MEXICO AND
   CENTRAL BRAZIL: A BETA DIVERSITY APPROACH},
Journal = {BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD BOTANICA DE MEXICO},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {45-58},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We studied the spatial arrangement of floristic diversity in two systems
   of limestone outcrops, located in two distant Neotropical sites: the
   region of Nizanda (S Mexico) and the Parana Valley (Central Brazil). We
   addressed the question whether their vegetation Could display a similar
   zonation, and we explored the relative effects of distance and an
   environmental gradient on alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversities. The
   limestone outcrops at both sites are similar in size and in elevation,
   but strongly differ ill between-outcrop distance by all order of
   magnitude. At each Study site three individual limestone outcrops were
   selected; in each of them three plant communities along the edaphic
   gradient were distinguished (a xerophytic scrub and two tropical dry
   forests types, one of which had a more xeric character than the other),
   and sampled for structural variables and floristic composition in
   100-m(2) plots. At both study sites, structural variables responded
   similarly to the edaphic gradient. Species density was larger in Nizanda
   for both alpha- and gamma-diversity, but the largest value of
   beta-diversity was obtained in Parana. The edaphic gradient produced
   larger mean beta-diversity values than the simple distance effect, with
   the interaction of both factors resulting in an even larger
   beta-diversity. Classification analyses by site showed larger floristic
   similarities between the two xerophytic communities than those existing
   between them and the more mesic forests. The spatial arrangement of
   diversity showed that both alpha- and gamma-diversity were smaller for
   the xerophytic communities. As hypothesized, the more extreme changes in
   community physiognomy were associated with larger P-diversity values.},

Abstract = {To determine stress effects at histological level in the digestive
   system, organisms of Paralabrax maculatofasciatus were submitted to 2
   stress models. One of decreasing the water level (n=84) for 30 and 60
   min daily, and another at high density cultures (n=96) of 1.6 and 3.2
   Kg/100 l. Stomach and the liver samples were fixed in 10\% formalin,
   embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 6 mu m and stained with
   haematoxylin-eosin. In both stress conditions, the stomach showed
   important morphological changes in the mucosa layer, such as hypertrophy
   and atrophy. In the liver, coloration and texture changes were observed
   as well as haemolisis, inflammation and necrosis. In the water decrease
   model, the mucosa layer of stomach showed significant morphometric
   differences (P<0.05), between different times of stress exposure and/or
   between different days, in some of the measured parameters. In the
   high-density model, significant differences in the stomach mucosa showed
   a sampling-density interaction in 4 parameters and 6 other parameters
   showed differences with no interaction. Liver showed significant
   differences in nuclear perimeter between sampling-days. Stress caused by
   high-density culture proved to be the factor that caused the most
   serious tissue damage.},

Title = {β-Diversity and vegetation structure as influenced by slope
   aspect and altitude in a seasonally dry tropical landscape},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-482},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Topography strongly affects the distribution of insolation in the
   terrain. Patterns of incoming solar radiation affect energy and water
   balances within a landscape, resulting in changes in vegetation
   attributes. Unlike other regions, in seasonally dry tropical forest
   areas the potential contribution of topography-related environmental
   heterogeneity to beta-diversity is unclear. In Mt. Cerro Verde (Oaxaca),
   S. Mexico, we: (1) modelled potential energy income for N- and S-facing
   slopes based on a digital elevation model, (2) examined the response of
   vegetation structure to slope aspect and altitude and (3) related
   variations in plant diversity to topography-related heterogeneity.
   Vegetation survey and modelling of potential energy income (SOLEI-32
   model) were based on 30 plots equally distributed among three
   altitudinal belts defined for each slope of the mountain; combining the
   three altitudinal belts and the two slopes produced six environmental
   groups, represented by five vegetation plots each. Potential energy
   income was about 20\% larger on the S than on the N slope (9,735 versus
   8,138 MJ/m(2)), but it did not vary with altitude. In addition, the
   temporal behaviour of potential energy income throughout the year
   differed greatly between slopes. Vegetation structure did not show
   significant changes linked to the environmental gradients analysed, but
   altitude and aspect did affect beta-diversity. We argue that the classic
   model of slope aspect effect on vegetation needs reconsideration for
   tropical landscapes.},

Abstract = {We study the shear-induced diffusion effect and the transition to
   irreversibility in suspensions under oscillatory shear flow by
   performing an analysis of the entropy production associated with the
   motion of the particles. We show that the Onsager coupling between
   different contributions to the entropy production is responsible for the
   scaling of the mean square displacement on particle diameter and applied
   strain. We also show that the shear-induced effective diffusion
   coefficient depends on the volume fraction, and use lattice-Boltzmann
   simulations to characterize the effect through the power spectrum of
   particle positions for different Reynolds numbers and volume fractions.
   Our study gives a thermodynamic explanation of the transition to
   irreversibility through a pertinent analysis of the second law of
   thermodynamics.},

Abstract = {This paper has a twofold aim. On one side, it explains what is
   understood by a semantic approach proof of the strong
   soundness-completeness theorem. On the other, it introduces such a proof
   for Godel's famous theorem, using the compactness theorem and other
   semantic results. The ingredients of the proof are well-known, but the
   proof itself is original, elegant and clear, because it avoids the
   unintuitive syntactic manipulations derived from the use of a given
   deductive calculus. We will be working within first order classical
   logic and a slightly modified version of the formal system concept,
   where the definition of formal derivation includes the possibility to
   establish restrictions to the applications of inference rules.},

Abstract = {The ant community from the shrub layer in a tropical deciduous forest
   was sampled for two years with Malaise traps. A total of 1,256 ants
   belonging to 48 species and 21 genera were collected. The most abundant
   species were Ecrton burchelli, Crematogaster brevispinosa and Pheidole
   sp. 1, which represented more than 60\% of the total. A time series
   analysis was performed to evaluate the seasonality in the ant abundance.
   This showed a cyclical pattern, with a displacement around 15 days
   between the first rain the abundance peak of ants. A significant
   positive correlation was found between precipitation and ant abundance,
   while the temperature did not have a significant relationship. The use
   of Malaise traps is useful to characterize the structure of the

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {This article illustrates a practical way to connect and coordinate the
   teaching and learning of physics and mathematics. The starting point is
   the electrostatic potential, which is obtained in any introductory
   course of electromagnetism from the Coulomb potential and the
   superposition principle for any charge distribution. The necessity to
   develop solutions to the Laplace and Poisson differential equations is
   also recognized, identifying the Coulomb potential as the generating
   function of harmonic functions. Correspondingly, the convenience of
   expressing the electrostatic potential in terms of its multipole
   expansion in spherical coordinates, or as integral transforms based on
   harmonic functions in different coordinate systems, is also established.
   These connections provide a motivation for teachers and students to
   acquire the necessary mathematics as a basic tool in the study of
   electromagnetic theory, optics and quantum mechanics.},

Abstract = {We conducted a 5 year demographic study in one population of the
   viviparous lizard Sceloporus grammicus Wiegmann, 1828 in central Mexico.
   The population was structured in three size classes (juveniles, small
   adults, and asymptotic adults) for which we estimated annual survival
   and fecundity rates. A population projection matrix was constructed for
   each annual transition. All of them resulted in finite rates of
   population growth (lambda) that, although variable from year to year
   (from 0.808 to 1.065), were not significantly different than unity,
   indicating population stability. Elasticity analysis revealed that
   survival staying in the same size class was the demographic process that
   made the greatest contribution to lambda values in most years.
   Similarly, the stasis of large adults was the vital rate with the
   highest relative importance for population persistence. To incorporate
   the observed yearly variation in long-term population projections, we
   used a mean matrix, a stochastic simulation, and a resampling procedure.
   All these resulted in long-term population growth rates that were not
   significantly different than unity. Our results indicate overall
   demographic stability for the studied population of S. grammicus.},

Journal = {AGROCIENCIA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Pages = {827-834},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {Although the deforestation rate of the dry tropical forests in Mexico is
   high, very few native species are propagated in local nurseries, which
   limits their restoration. Many Bursera species are dominant elements of
   these forests, but their propagation is difficult because of the reduced
   germination of their seeds. In this work an evaluation is made of seed
   germination of six species of Bursera (B. bicolor, B. bipinnata, B.
   cipallifera, B. fagaroides, B. glabrifolia and B. grandifolia) of the
   northwestern region of Morelos, Mexico. In a First assay, a high
   proportion of empty seeds was found in B. pinnata, B. fagaroides and B.
   grandifolia. Germination was higher with fluctuating temperature rather
   than with constant temperature. The germination of stored seeds of these
   three species during six months at room temperature and in refrigeration
   (5 degrees C) did not differ significantly and was from 30 to 60\% in B.
   bicolor, B. copallifera and B. glabrifolia. A solution of benzyladenine
   (150 ppm) increased germination of one of the three species (B.
   copallifera). In the field, the seeds of B. bicolor and B. copallifera
   presented germination percentages similar to those registered at
   fluctuating temperature.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {72},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {Cactus seedlings often establish under nurse plants which modify
   environmental conditions by increasing moisture and decreasing solar
   radiation, which may cause beneficial and detrimental effects,
   respectively, on seedling growth. Three soil moisture treatments (5\%.
   25\% and 60\%) and two solar radiation levels (100\% exposure = 243 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1), and 40\% = 102 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were used in a
   factorial design to analyze seedling growth response of three rare
   cactus species (Mammillaria pectinifera, Obregonia denegrii and
   Coryphantha werdermannii). The variables evaluated were relative growth
   rate (RGR), root/shoot ratio (R/S), and K (RGR(roots)/RGR(shoot)),
   obtained from an initial seedling harvest (6-month-old seedlings) and a
   final harvest 6 months after treatment application. All three species
   had slow RGRs (0.002-0.012 gg(-1) day(-1)). O. denegrii had the lowest
   RGR values, but was the only species for which RIS and K varied with
   soil moisture. While all seedlings responded markedly to soil moisture,
   no response was observed to radiation treatments. The latter might have
   been related to the relatively low solar radiation levels present in the
   greenhouse. Yet, our results suggest that the main benefit nurse plants
   offer to seedlings is the increase in soil moisture. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {The structural and electronic properties of Au and Au-2 adsorbed on five
   coordinated oxygen and magnesium regular terrace sites, on the neutral
   F-s color center (oxygen vacancy containing two electrons), and on the
   charged F-s(+) color center (oxygen vacancy containing one electron) of
   the MgO(100) surface have been investigated using a density functional
   theory cluster embedding approach. Two types of calculations have been
   performed. In one, we optimized and calculated the energetics of the
   systems using a generalized gradient approximation, and in the second,
   we used a combined approach, optimizing the geometries using a local
   density approximation and then performing a single point energy
   calculation using a generalized gradient approximation. Our studies also
   examine the effect of relaxation of the substrate. This was accomplished
   through two studies: first, both the MgO surface and the Au atoms were
   optimized, and second, the MgO surface atoms were kept fixed while the
   Au atoms were allowed to relax. We report the geometry, adsorption, and
   dimerization energies of the lowest energy and low energy isomers at
   each adsorption site, charge transfers from the MgO surface to the Au
   atoms in the lowest energy isomers, and compare our findings with
   previous theoretical studies. This comparison allowed us to establish in
   most of the cases limits for the adsorption energies, binding energies,
   and geometrical parameters at each adsorption site. For the case of
   Au-2, for each adsorption site, our studies confirm the lowest energy
   isomer and most of the low energy isomers, previously reported, when
   both the surface and the Au-2 are optimized. For most cases, the studies
   with frozen MgO surface atoms produced similar results as the studies
   when the MgO surface atoms were optimized. However, for the Mg site we
   found that the restrictions introduced by keeping the surface frozen
   favored the coexistence of an additional low energy isomer, and for the
   F-s(+) site, the restrictions favored the dissociation of the adsorbed
   Au-2 dimer into two surface adsorbed Au atoms. In general, both fully
   generalized gradient and combined calculations produced similar results,
   though, in the case of the F-s site the combined calculations found
   another low lying isomer, and in the case of the F-s(+) site it
   predicted the dissociation of the adsorbed Au-2 dimer, and inverted the
   energetic order of the lowest energy and low energy isomers. An increase
   in the charge transfer from the MgO surface to the Au atoms at the
   different adsorption sites according with the number of localized
   electrons at the adsorption sites was found. Finally, we found that the
   site with the largest adsorption and dimerization energies, and where an
   Au atom is most stable and can grow, is the neutral F-s center.},

   paper we investigate 1/2-homogeneity of the 2-fold symmetric product

   compact, connected ANR, then F-2(X) is 1/2-homogeneous if and only if X
   is an arc or a simple closed curve. We also show that this
   characterization does not generalize to higher dimensions. Further, we
   give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the 2-fold
   symmetric product of an n-manifold is 1/2-homogeneous. (C) 2008 Elsevier

   infinite minimal sets for continuous functions on connected linearly

   can fail to be metrizable. However, no examples of such subsets have

Abstract = {We evaluated the plant richness and conservation value of three areas
   recently added to the territory of the Pedregal de San Angel Ecological
   Reserve: two of them added to the Southeastern core area (SO1 and SO2),
   and one to the buffer zone called A13. Cumulative plant richness was 199
   species (57.6\% of the species previously recorded in the literature).
   In SO1, SO2 and A13, the numbers of recorded plant species were 148, 152
   and 149, respectively. Mammillaria haageana subsp. san-angelensis, which
   is an endangered cactus species, Bletia urbana, a threatened orchid, as
   well as a two new records for this site (Eupatorium pazcuarense and
   Adiantum andicola) were found in A13. Pennisetum clandestinum is an
   introduced species that occurs in disturbed areas of this reserve. With
   these three species, the total plant richness of the reserve goes up to
   340 taxa. Based on a conservation value index calculated on the basis of
   eight parameters, A 13 showed the highest value (21 points), followed by

Abstract = {Biogeographical patterns of the Mexican flora are explained based on 3
   different theories, considering number of species, endemisms, and
   relations among areas: 1) dispersalist theory, where Mexico has been
   considered as the receiver of elements of different sources or
   geographic areas, considering that it is located in the transition zone
   between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, which along the
   autochthonous ones form a complex mixture of species with different
   origins, both spatial and temporal, 2) vicariant theory, that proposes a
   close relationship between the earth's history and the history of the
   biota, so that the number of species and their distribution may be
   explained by the complex geologic history of Mexico, and 3) pleistocenic
   glaciations, which explain the recent distributional patterns of plants
   based on ecological and historical arguments, based on paleoclimatic
   changes of the recent past. A continuous debate within historical
   biogeography has high lighted the importance of biogeography as source
   of evidence for taxonomy and vice versa. Historical biogeography has a
   close relationship with systematics, but is an independent discipline
   within comparative biology. Biogeography is undergoing a conceptual
   revolution that is causing a revision of its fundamentals and methods.
   The utilization of different methods in an integrative manner in the
   same analysis may maximize the advantages of each one.},

Abstract = {We study the time until first occurrence, the first-passage time, of
   rare density fluctuations in diffusive systems. We approach the problem
   using a model consisting of many independent random walkers on a
   lattice. The existence of spatial correlations makes this problem
   analytically intractable. However, for a mean-field approximation in
   which the walkers can jump anywhere in the system, we obtain a simple
   asymptotic form for the mean first-passage time to have a given number k
   of particles at a distinguished site. We show numerically, and argue
   heuristically, that for large enough k, the mean-field results give a
   good approximation for first-passage times for systems with
   nearest-neighbour dynamics, especially for two and higher spatial
   dimensions. Finally, we show how the results change when density
   fluctuations anywhere in the system, rather than at a specific
   distinguished site, are considered. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2008.},

Abstract = {Testicular development occurs prenatally in mammals. The developmental
   underlying mechanism is only partially understood. The aim of the
   present investigation was to study the expression of the gene coding for
   insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf-1) and Igf-1 type 1 receptor (Igf-1r)
   and their respective proteins in mouse Sertoli and Leydig cells at
   gestation day 12 (E12)-E18. Moreover, we sought to determine the effect
   of IGF-1 on the proliferation of both cell types and to establish the
   signal transduction mechanism involved in the IGF-1 pathway. Transcripts
   for the Igf-1 and lgf-lr genes were found in Sertoli and Leydig cells
   from E12-E18. Highest IGF-1 and IGF-Ir protein expression levels were
   found in both cell types at E18. Exogenous IGF-1 administration
   increased Sertoll and Leydig cell proliferation at E14-E18 in vitro.
   Inhibition of the pathway mitogen-activated extracellular
   signal-regulated protein kinase (MEK) 1/2 with UO126 diminished the
   proliferation of the Sertoli and Leydig cells in vitro. We propose that
   IGF-1 and IGF-1r regulate Sertoli and Leydig cell proliferation through
   the MEW extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signal
   transduction pathway, leading to development and growth of the mouse
   embryonic testis.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study both, analytically and numerically, the
   spatio-temporal dynamics of a three interacting species mathematical
   model. The populations take the form of pollinators, a plant and
   herbivores; the model consists of three nonlinear
   reaction-diffusion-advection equations. In view of considering the full
   model, as a previous step we firstly analyze a matualistic interaction
   (pollinator-plant), later on a predator-prey (plant-herbivore)
   interaction model is studied and finally, we consider the full model. In
   all cases, the purely temporal dynamics is given; meanwhile for the
   spatio-temporal dynamics, we use numerical simulations, corresponding to
   those parameter values for which we obtain interesting temporal
   dynamics.},

   of the Hurst exponent of fractional kinetics. Theory is compared with

Abstract = {Prasiolales are characterized by high morphological plasticity. This
   problem in taxonomic delimitation of the species may be a result of
   environment heterogeneity. Habitat characteristics and morphological
   variation of P. mexicana and P. nevadensis, two species of freshwater
   leaf-like thallus green algae, were investigated in five sites in
   central Mexico where the morphological traits of these species overlap.
   Comparisons were made between habitat characteristics among streams and
   transects with and without Prasiola samples. Although no consistent
   correlation was found between environmental variables and morphological
   traits, a significantly wider range of habitat characteristics of
   current velocity and irradiance and morphometric variation (lamina
   length, lamina diameter, cell length, surface of the thallus, thickness
   and number of layers) suggested that P. mexicana was more plastic than
   P. nevadensis in its physicochemical requirements. Our results suggest
   that small variation of microhabitat conditions in P. nevadensis
   (irradiance and current velocity) could explain its very restricted
   geographic range in streams in central Mexico.},

Abstract = {Thalli of Prasiola mexicana J.Agardh (Chlorophya) were collected in the
   river Magdalena D.F. monthly during a year 2000-2001 (December-November)
   and the associated diatoms were analyzed. Two different collected points
   were selected. The first (P1) located in an inclined zone of permanent
   flow where P mexicana was always in contact with the water: the annual
   average of current velocity was 0.77 m s(-1). The second (P2) was
   located in a backwater at river edge where P mexicana was occasionally
   exposed to drying; the annual average of current velocity was 0.17 m
   s(-1). A total of 31 species of diatoms were recorded (7 new records for
   the region), 19\% of them compatible with temperate and Nordic-alpine
   zones. The species richness was 24 at P1 and 31 at P2 and was more
   constant at P1. The most abundant and frequent diatoms in the two
   communities were Achnanthes lanceolata, Cocconeis placentula, Navicula
   cryptocephala and Cymbella silesiaca. The Friedman test are applied for
   pigments and diversity showed that the collected points were
   significantly different, and the multiple linear regression in both
   communities suggested that the environmental and microenvironmental
   variables evaluated did not display a significant relation to the
   changes in the structure of the communities of diatoms. Were found that
   the diversity at P1 had a positive relation whit the concentration of
   chlorophyll b and the free ash dry weight of Prasiola mexicana (p <
   0.05), whereas at P2 this relation only occured with the free ash dry
   weight (p < 0.05). Observations in field and laboratory suggests that
   the dynamics of the communities of each of the collected points at the
   two zones was related with the expression of Prasiola mexicana: the
   smooth thalli had scarce sediments at P1 mainly epiphytic diatoms
   whereas the rough thalli had abundant sediments at P2 with epiphytic,
   epipsammic and edaphic species also, such as Achnanthes exigua, Navicula
   radiosa, Navicula rhynchocephala, Pinnularia borealis and Rhoicosphenia
   abbreviata.},

Abstract = {Environmental conditions and resource availability under the canopy of
   nurse shrubs in xeric ecosystems are not homogeneous and affect growth
   rate, survivorship and some morphological traits of young cacti plants.
   We studied the effect of a gradient of photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) on two traits of the columnar cactus Neobuxbaumia
   tetetzo: (1) individuals height and (12) length of its apical thorns
   under the nurse shrub Mimosa luisana in the Zapotitlan Salinas Valley,
   Puebla (Mexico). We found a positive correlation between the length of
   the apical thorns and the distance from the nurse shrub, as well as
   between the height of N. tetetzo and the length of apical thorns.
   Likewise, the correlation between N. tetetzo size and the distance from
   the nurse shrub was positive. A multiple regression analysis showed that
   the length of the apical thorns depends on the size of N. tetetzo
   individuals, but not on the distance from the nurse shrub. Additionally,
   the sizes of the N. tetetzo individuals were also dependent on distance
   from the nurse shrub. When N. tetetzo establishes on the periphery of a
   nurse shrub the recruitment probability is low as a cause of the high
   radiation level. Likewise, this factor can have a, negative effect on
   the growth rate because high temperatures reduce photosynthetic rates.},

Title = {Stress in callus of Hippocratea excelsa:: Catalase activity,

Journal = {INTERCIENCIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Stress factors often induce oxidative stress in plant cells, generally
   leading to the synthesis of signal molecules that activate a range of
   signal transduction pathways and antioxidants. One of the signal
   molecules produced under stress is H2O2, which has been associated to
   production in vitro of secondary metabolites (SM) and to antioxidant
   activity. Canophyllol production by Hippocratea excelsa was used as an
   example to show the enhanced production of SM under stress. Seeds
   obtained from fruits were cultured in vitro. Two stresses were applied:
   nutritional, by reducing the amount of N-2, and osmotic, using
   polyethylene glycol. Canophyllol, H2O2 content and catalase activity
   were measured. Nutritional stress caused a different response than
   osmotic stress for catalase activity and canophyllol accumulation,
   whereas H2O2 contents increased under both stresses. The highest amount
   of canophyllol (8 times the control) was obtained under the nutritional
   stress, in the treatment with 25\% of control N-2 strength. This work
   demonstrates that the responses of canophyllol production and catalase
   activity in H. excelsa callus are differentially signaled by the
   different stress factors.},

Title = {The narrow-leaf syndrome: a functional and evolutionary approach to the

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {151},

Abstract = {Plants that use fog as an important water-source frequently have a
   rosette growth habit. The performance of this morphology in relation to
   fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from
   physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits
   (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or
   epiphytism) which constitute the ``narrow-leaf syndrome{''} should
   increase fog-interception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum
   models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and
   were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven
   species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The total
   amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf
   area, while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency (measured as
   interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is
   physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can only have a few
   blades. At the limits of this constraint, net fog interception was
   independent of leaf form, but interception efficiency was maximized by
   large numbers of narrow leaves. Atmospheric Tillandsia species show the
   narrow-leaf syndrome. Their fog interception efficiencies were
   correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum-model data. In the larger
   xerophytic rosette species, the interception efficiency was greatest in
   plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome. The adaptation to
   fog-harvesting in several narrow-leaved rosettes was tested for
   evolutionary convergence in 30 xerophytic rosette species using a
   comparative method. There was a significant evolutionary tendency
   towards the development of the narrow-leaf syndrome the closer the
   species grew to areas where fog is frequently available. This study
   establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing
   genera as contrasting as Tillandsia and Agave as a result of their
   dependence on fog.},

Abstract = {Echeveria longissima, a threatened herb whose habitat has been severely
   overgrazed and eroded, was studied for three years in a currently grazed
   and a fenced area. Matrix population models were used to assess if
   livestock elimination provides a proper management strategy. The merits
   of retrospective perturbation analyses in terms of management planning
   have been debated. Nevertheless, they may prove useful when applied in
   combination with exclosures because they may detect the effects of
   anthropogenic disturbance on population dynamics. Thus, the results of
   retrospective and prospective methods were compared. A rapid decrease in
   population size was projected in both areas, even though it was faster
   in the exposed one. The demographic processes that were favourable or
   detrimental in a given year were magnified outside of the fence, but
   buffered in the exclosure, showing a strong drought-disturbance
   synergism. Thus, the largest difference in the population growth rate
   lambda between areas was observed in the driest year. Higher nurse-plant
   density inside the fence seems to alleviate drought effects. The use of
   prospective analysis alone may lead to erroneous management decisions,
   since the highest elasticities corresponded to transitions that were
   favoured by human activities. While allowing for an increased lambda in
   the short term, intervention aimed at increasing these transitions
   further without attending others that are lessened by disturbance may
   introduce large changes in the population dynamics, with negative
   long-term consequences. Retrospective methods can detect which processes
   have been altered by disturbance and its synergisms, so we may more
   efficiently restore healthy population dynamics.},

Abstract = {In spite of its importance and diversity, species of the genus Bursera
   are not propagated extensively in Mexican nurseries, and there are few

   in cuttings of Bursera lancifolia, B. longipes, B. fagaroides, B.
   bicolor, B. glabrifolia, B. copallifera, and B. bipinnata in response to
   two treatments: application of indolebutyric acid (IBA) powder (1500 and
   10 000 ppm) and a control, with 15-18 cuttings per treatment. The
   cuttings were kept four months in bags with a sand, black earth and
   compost substrate in a rural nursery of Huajintlan, SW of the State of
   Morelos. The bags were in the open with regular irrigation and no
   control of environmental humidity. The percentage of callus formation
   was high (27-85\%) in six species. The species with higher root
   production were B. fagaroides (70\%) and B. glabrifolia (51\%). In these
   species, as in B. copallifera (18\%), root production did not increase
   with the application of IBA. In B. lancifolia (27\%) and B. bipinnata
   (29\%) there was not significant response in roots production with IBA
   application. Root production was low in B. longipes and B. bicolor (9

Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {3},
Number = {11},
Pages = {794-802},
Abstract = {TOR (Target of rapamycin) kinase is a central component of a signal
   transduction pathway that regulates cellular growth in response to
   nutrients, mitogens and growth factors in eukaryotes. Knowledge of the
   TOR pathway in plants is scarce, and reports in agronomical relevant
   plants are lacking. Previous studies indicate that Arabidopsis thaliana
   TOR (AtTOR) activity is resistant to rapamycin whereas maize TOR (ZmTOR)
   is not, suggesting that plants might have different regulation
   mechanisms for this signal transduction pathway. In the present work
   maize ZmTOR cDNA was identified and its expression regulation was
   analyzed during germination on different tissues at various stages of
   differentiation and by the main ZmTOR regulators. Our results show that
   ZmTOR contains all functional domains characteristic of metazoan TOR
   kinase. ZmTOR expression is highly regulated during germination, a
   critical plant development period, but not on other tissues of
   contrasting physiological characteristics. Bioinformatic analyses
   indicated that maize FKBP12 and rapamycin form a functional structure
   capable of targeting the ZmTOR protein, similar to other non-plant
   eukaryotes, further supporting its regulation by rapamycin ( in contrast
   with the rapamycin insensitivity of Arabidopsis thaliana) and the
   conservation of rapamycin regulation through plant evolution.},

Volume = {352},

Abstract = {In this work, following Naumis' ideas {[}G.G. Naumis, Phys. Rev. B 61
   (2000) R9205], we include the floppy modes as a free energy in order to
   obtain the configurational and excess entropy as well as the jump of the
   heat capacity of the chalcogenide glasses as function of the
   coordination number < r >. Theoretically, we find that S-ex/S-c ranges
   from 1.5 for strong liquids (< r > = 2) to 2 for fragile ones (< r > =
   2.4). These results are consistent with the values reported by Angell
   and Borick {[}C.A. Angell, S. Borick, J. Non-Cryst. Solids 307\&310
   (2002) 393], who find experimentally for selenium, < r > = 2, S-ex/S-c =
   1.47. The proportionality between the configurational and total excess
   entropies supports the non-existence of the Adam-Gibbs equation paradox.
   Finally, using S, in the Adam-Gibbs equation we obtain a VFT-like
   equation as function of < r >, predicting that when < r > increases, D
   decreases as well, as it has been seen in previous work. (c) 2006

Year = {2006},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Succulent plants are prone to overheating due to their massive organs
   and lack of daytime transpiration. Thus; they frequently grow in cool
   microenvironments. Due to their verticality, cliffs avoid sunlight at
   noon, providing a cool refuge during the hottest hours of the day. We
   test the hypothesis that species in the genus Mammillaria (Cactaceae)
   are associated with cliffs in hot areas. We compared the temperatures
   and light interception of Mammillaria crucigera experimentally placed on
   a cliff and on the plateau above it. Through comparative analysis of 10
   species we tested if those living in warmer areas inhabit steeper
   slopes. We found that plants and soil on the cliff were 9.9 and 14.4
   degrees C cooler than their counterparts in the plateau at noon. While
   the temperatures on the plateau were within the range that has been
   found to inhibit photosynthetic activity, those on the cliff were closer
   to the optimal ones for CO2 fixation in other cacti. Living on the cliff
   may be costly because radiation is reduced by 38.2\%. A comparative
   analysis revealed an evolutionary trend toward living on steeper slopes
   when the climate is hot. This may contribute to explain why
   cliff-dwellers have evolved in so many succulent-plant families. (c)

Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3773-3799},

Abstract = {The main goal of this study is to document the biogeographical patterns,
   current status and conservation of 24 species of vascular plants in
   Mexico, all of them recorded in some risk category in the Mexican
   official publication named `Norma Oficial Mexicana 059' (NOM-059) and
   some of them in the IUCN red lists (the World Conservation Union) and
   CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species); many of
   these species are linked to Mexican cloud forests and other temperate
   vegetation types. Distribution maps of these 24 species were generated
   with information obtained from specialized literature, herbarium
   specimens, institutional databases, and field work; with this
   information, the patterns of richness and endemism of these species were
   obtained. For this, the Mexican territory was divided using a grid
   system based on a chart index (scale 1:50,000 system composed by grids
   of 15' x 20'). Also, we up to date the knowledge of these species and
   their populations and current habitats, and evaluate their geographic
   distribution in relation to the current Mexican National Parks and
   Reserves System and Mexican Priority Regions for Conservation. We also
   discuss some changes of categories in the NOM-059 and suggest the urgent
   incorporation of some of the species in the recent IUCN Red Data List of
   Threatened Species (2003). Most of the species studied require special
   policies for their conservation due to problems that affect their
   natural populations; also we consider that these taxa are
   underrepresented in the current Mexican System of Natural Protected
   Areas, especially those with restricted distributions.},

Abstract = {A novel approach to the dynamics of dilute solutions of polymer
   molecules under flow conditions is proposed by applying the rules of
   mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics (MNET). The probability density
   describing the state of the system is taken to be a function of the
   position and velocity of the molecules, and on a local vector parameter
   accounting for its deformation. This function obeys a generalized
   Fokker-Planck equation, obtained by calculating the entropy production
   of the system, and identifying the corresponding probability currents in
   terms of generalized forces. In simple form, this coarse-grained
   description allows one to derive hydrodynamic equations where molecular
   deformation and diffusion effects are coupled. A class of non-linear
   constitutive relations for the pressure tensor are obtained. Particular
   models are considered and compared with experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Shrubs are important elements of semi-desert vegetation. They provide
   microhabitats for the establishment of many species under their canopies
   thus maintaining community structure and diversity. Yet, little is known
   regarding their population processes and the factors that affect them.
   In this study, we report an analysis of the population dynamics of the
   shrub Acacia bilimekii. We followed a population sample (N = 314) for a
   one-year period (2001-02) and built a projection matrix. We also carried
   out germination and seedling establishment experiments in two
   contrasting conditions: a well preserved and an eroded site, and both
   under the shade of shrubs and in the open. The results of these
   experiments were used to calculate the fecundity entries for the
   transition matrix. Germination was not affected by microhabitat (shade
   vs. open conditions) or site (eroded vs. well-preserved). However,
   seedling establishment after 7 months was significantly higher under the
   shade than in exposed conditions. Finite population growth rate was
   significantly higher than unity (lambda = 1.23 +/- 0.173). Stasis was
   the demographic process that contributed mostly to lambda (ca. 60\%),
   followed by growth and fecundity. Even with a simulated decrease in
   fecundity values due to increased erosion, the A. bilimekii population
   would maintain a high lambda-value. Thus, our results suggest that this
   population has the potential to persist even under relatively high
   disturbance levels. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Biogeography is a discipline included in comparative biology that
   studies the distribution of organisms; the distributional patterns of
   organisms are analyzed through the application of different methods,
   depending on the question formulated. In this work the principles and
   advantages of some of these methods when the the principles and
   advantages of some of these methods when they are applied to the
   geographic distribution of the gymnosperms of Mexico are presented, and
   the convenience and applicability of each method in relation to the
   distributional range of the species is discussed. Particularly, in the
   case of Mexican gymnosperms, parsimony analysis of endemicity and
   panbiogeography have the disadvantage that their methods do not include
   those species with restricted ranges, whereas cladistic biogeography
   only includes taxa with phylogenetic information. In contrast,
   areograpky and predicted distributions consider all the species,
   independently of their distributional range and availability of
   phylogenetic information. It is concluded that the different
   bio-geographic methods can be used under the same analysis as
   complementary phases or components, despite the fact that some of them
   have been considered as antagonist research programs. This kind of
   studies generates valuable information that permits to extend the
   knowledge about the history of Mexican biota and to increase the
   knowledge on the biogeography of Mexican gymnosperms.},

Title = {Demography of Bursera glabrifolia, a tropical tree used for folk

Abstract = {Tropical dry forest in Mesoamerica has long been disturbed by the
   extraction of different forest products by local inhabitants. Bursera
   glabrifolia (white ``copalillo{''}) is a dry tropical forest tree
   extensively used in several communities of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico,
   for the elaboration of folk-art woodcarvings called ``alebrijes{''}.
   Historically, the extraction of B. glabrifolia had not been regulated;
   however, in October 2002, the first management plan for this species was
   implemented in San Juan Bautista Jayacatlan, based on abundance,
   distribution and dasonomic data. However, no demographic information is
   available on which to base a sounder management plan that would
   guarantee the ecological sustainability of this extractive activity.
   Thus, we studied the population dynamics of this species over a 2-year
   period in Jayacatlan, where no tree extraction had taken place since
   1998. We used stem expansion rates and observations on survival and
   fecundity to build size-based population projection matrices. The
   projected population growth rate values (lambda) were 1.14 and 1.04 for
   the 2001-2002 and the 2002-2003 periods, respectively. These values
   suggest that the B. glabrifolia population at Jayacatlan shows a growing
   trend. Several harvesting scenarios were simulated to theoretically
   assess the impact on population dynamics of harvesting whole trees and,
   in particular, to ascertain whether the extraction regime recommended by
   the management plan (8 trees/ha/yr) is sustainable. For this purpose, we
   used an average population matrix where specific entries were modified
   to simulate different extraction levels. The results suggest that the
   harvesting regimes established in the management plan for B. glabrifolia
   are sustainable. However, resource managers should not exceed the
   amounts recommended by the management plan and should avoid
   extrapolating our results to other regions of the country where no
   demographic studies have been carried out. The need for long-term
   demographic studies and their incorporation in `adaptive management
   plans' is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We studied three species of columnar cacti in the genus Neobuxbaumia
   which differ in their degree of rarity: Neobuxbaumia macrocephala (the
   rarest), Neobuxbaumia tetetzo (intermediate), and Neobuxbaumia
   mezcalaensis (the most common). To investigate the ecological factors
   that limit their distribution and abundance, we surveyed 80 localities
   within the region of Tehuacan-Cuicatlan, in Central Mexico. At each
   locality we measured several environmental variables, and the density of
   the Neobuxbaumia populations present. We used a principal component
   analysis (PCA) to identify the factors that are associated to the
   presence/absence of each species. Additionally, we carried out multiple
   regressions between environmental variables and population density to
   test whether the variation in these variables was related to changes in
   abundance. The results show that factors significantly affecting the
   distribution of these species are mean annual temperature, altitude,
   rainfall, and soil proper-ties such as texture and organic matter
   content. N mezcalaensis reaches maximum population densities of 14,740
   plants per ha (average density = 3943 plants per ha) and is associated
   with localities with relatively abundant rainfall. N tetetzo shows
   maximum population densities of 14,060 plants per ha (average = 3070
   plants per ha), and is associated with sites located at high latitudes
   and with high phosphorous content in the soil. The rarest species, N
   macrocephala, shows maximum densities of 1180 plants per ha (average =
   607 plants per ha) and is associated with localities with high soil
   calcium content. The distribution of this species is limited to sites
   with specific values of the environmental variables recorded, conferring
   it a high habitat specificity which accounts for its rarity. (c) 2006

Abstract = {In this study we use a demographic approach to analyse the differing
   abundance of three congeneric columnar cacti: Neobuxbaumia macrocephala
   ( the rarest), Neobuxbaumia tetetzo ( intermediate), and Neobuxbaumia
   mezcalaensis ( the most common). Populations of these species were
   studied in the Tehuacan Valley ( Central Mexico) over a 3-year period.
   We employed traditional models and life table response experiments
   (LTRE) to explore the association between particular demographic traits
   and the degree of rarity of each species. Most matrices showed
   population growth rate (lambda) values close to unity; the only
   exception was N. mezcalaensis in 2001 - 2002 (lambda = 1.091 +/- 0.088).
   In the three species the highest elasticity values corresponded to
   entries referring to the stasis of pre-reproductive plant and small
   adults. However, the LTRE indicated that most important differences in
   the lambda values between years and species were associated with
   variation in fruit production and seedling recruitment. N. mezcalaensis
   yielded the highest mean lambda due to its high fecundity in 2001 -
   2002. This result suggests that the variation in demographic behaviour
   observed between species is sufficient to explain the higher abundance
   of N. mezcalaensis compared to the rare N. macrocephala. The high
   fecundity values and recruitment success observed in the former, even if
   they occur only seldom, may result in higher average lambda values
   accounting for its high population densities.},

Abstract = {The Mezquital valley is a vast area near Mexico city that has been
   irrigated with wastewater from Mexico city for more than 50 years. At
   present, this water source continues to be used while new irrigation
   areas are being incorporated according to rural demand. This research
   study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the
   accumulation of metals in soils and plants and the physicochemical
   properties of soils irrigated in this manner for 50 and 100 years,
   respectively. Soil properties such as pH and total organic carbon (TOC)
   were determined by conventional methods. Plant and soil total trace
   metals Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb were determined using particle induced
   X-ray emission (PIXE). Lower pH and TOC contents were obtained for soils
   irrigated during 100 years, indicating a higher metal bioavailability.
   This is Dot reflected in plant content for most of the reported
   elements, but Zn and Pb show a higher absorption in 100 years old plots
   (26-79\%) than in 50-year-olds plots, indicating a pH dependence. (c)

Abstract = {The record of Almoloya Lake in the Upper Lerma basin starts with the
   deposition of the late Pleistocene Upper Toluca Pumice layer. The data
   from this interval indicate a period of climatic instability that lasted
   until 8500 cal yr B.P., when temperature conditions stabilized, although
   moisture fluctuations continued until 8000 cal yr B.P. Between 8500 and
   5000 cal yr B.P. a temperate climate is indicated by dominance of Pinus.
   From 5000 to 3000 cal yr B.P. Quercus forest expanded, suggesting a warm
   temperate climate: a first indication of drier environmental conditions
   is an increase in grassland between 4200 and 3500 cal yr B.P. During the
   Late Holocene (3300 to 500 cal yr B.P.) the increase of Pinus and
   grassland indicates temperate dry conditions, with a considerable
   increase of Pinus between 1100 and 950 cal yr B.P. At the end of this
   period, humidity increased. The main tendency during the Holocene was a
   change from humid to dry conditions. During the Early Holocene, Almoloya
   Lake was larger and deeper; the changing humidity regime resulted in a
   fragmented marshland, with the presence of aquatic and subaquatic
   vegetation types. Published by University of Washington.},

Abstract = {Measuring how anthropogenic disturbance affects biological systems is
   crucial for conservation and management. However, it is often difficult
   to quantify disturbance when it occurs in a slow, long-lasting - or
   chronic - fashion. Because various human activities influence gradually
   an area, chronic disturbance must be measured on a continuous scale that
   accounts for different sources of disturbance. Here we propose a method
   to develop multimetric indices for chronic disturbance. The approach is
   exemplified by considering the effects of disturbance on the threatened
   cactus Mammillaria pectinifera. Fourteen indicators of three agents of
   disturbance (human activities, livestock raising and land degradation)
   were measured in 10 populations of M. pectinifiera, and summarised
   through principal components analysis (PCA). An index for each agent was
   also developed. M. pectinifera achieved maximum density at intermediate
   values of the first PCA axis, which was related to disturbance
   intensity. Assessing only both extremes of the disturbance gradient,
   where density is low, would erroneously suggest that disturbance has no
   effect on this plant. The different disturbance agents act
   synergistically on M. pectinifera, and their combined effects are
   detrimental. Land degradation reduces plant density, while livestock
   enhances it. However, overgrazing promotes degradation, so maintaining
   appropriate livestock levels is critical for management. Our method
   allowed us to identify which agents have more impact on threatened
   species, and sets the basis to manage disturbance agents in a way
   compatible with conservation. The method proposed here can be easily
   modified for its use in other environments and to account for different
   forms of anthropogenic disturbance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Based on the experimentally-found existence of two superconducting gaps
   in M-B, (one gap associated to the boron g-states and the other to the
   boron pi-states), the different contributions to the transport
   properties, electrical conductivity and Hall coefficient were studied
   using the full potential-linearized augmented plane wave method and the
   generalized gradient approximation. Four different relaxation times were
   needed to adjust the electrical conductivity and Hall coefficient to
   experimental values. MgB2 doping was analysed in the rigid band
   approximation; this permitted a detailed study of the partial
   Substitution of magnesium for aluminium (Mg1-xAlxB2). Other
   substitutions such as AB(2) (A = Be, Sc, Zr, Nb and Ta) are also
   discussed. The MgB2 or-bands (boron or-states), which are associated to
   the large gap, are very anisotropic at E-F, while the pi bands have very
   little anisotropic character. In Mg1-xAlxB2, T-c diminishes with Al
   content; the other compounds are not superconductors or have a low T-c.
   In this work it was found that with electron doping, such as Al
   substitution, the or-band conductivity decreases and the corresponding
   bands become less anisotropic. The sigma-band contribution for BeB2 and
   ScB2 at EF is very small and the anisotropy is much lower. For Zr, Nb
   and Ta there are no sigma-bands at EF. These results give a clear
   connection between superconductivity and the character of the
   sigma-band, band conductivity, and band anisotropy. This gives a
   plausible explanation for the diminution of T-c with different doping of
   MgB2.},

Abstract = {Thermodynamics for systems at non-equilibrium stationary states have
   been formulated, based on the assumption of the existence of a local
   equilibrium in phase space which enables one to interpret the
   probability density and its conjugated non-equilibrium chemical
   potential as mesoscopic thermodynamic variables. The probability current
   is obtained from the entropy production related to the probability
   diffusion process and leads to the formulation of the Fokker-Planck
   equation. For the case of a gas of Brownian particles under steady flow
   in the dilute and concentrated regimes, we derive non-equilibrium
   equations of state.},

Abstract = {Let G be a locally compact Hausdorff group. We study orbit spaces and
   unions of equivariant absolute neighborhood extensors (G-ANEs) in the
   category of all proper G-spaces that are metrizable by a G-invariant
   metric. We prove that if a proper G-space X is a G-ANE such that all the
   G-orbits in X are metrizable, then the G-orbit space X/G is an ANE.
   Equivariant versions of Harmer's theorem and Kodama's theorem about
   unions of absolute neighborhood extensors are established. We also
   introduce the notion of a G-polyhedron and prove that if G is any
   compact group, then every G-ANR is arbitrary closely dominated by a
   G-polyhedron. Each G-polyhedron is a G-ANE. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All

Volume = {116},

Abstract = {Geographic variations in the whistles of Hawai'ian spinner dolphins are
   discussed by comparing 27 spinner dolphin pods recorded in waters off
   the Islands of Kaua'i., O'ahu, Cana'i, and Hawai'i. Three different
   behavioral states, the number of dolphins observed in each pod, and ten
   parameters extracted from each whistle contour were considered by using
   clustering and discriminant function analyses. The results suggest that
   spinner dolphin pods in the Main Hawai'ian Islands share characteristics
   in approximately 48\% of their whistles. Spinner dolphin pods had
   similar whistle parameters regardless of the island, location, and date
   when they were sampled and the dolphins' behavioral state and pod size.
   The term ``whistle-specific subgroup{''} (WSS) was used to designate
   whistle groups with similar whistles parameters (which could have been
   produced in part by the same dolphins). The emission rate of whistles
   was higher when spinner dolphins were socializing than when they were
   traveling or resting, suggesting that whistles are mainly used during
   close-range interactions. Spinner dolphins also seem to vary whistle
   duration according to their general behavioral state. Whistle duration
   and the number of turns and steps of a whistle may be more important in
   delivering information at the individual level than whistle frequency
   parameters. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America.},

Abstract = {Microfossils associated with stromatolites in the Upper Cretaceous
   (Campanian--Maastrichtian) are preserved in chert layers of the
   Tarahumara Formation that crop out at the Huepac Chert locality in
   Sonora, Mexico. A high diversity of microfossils was reported in a
   previous publication and ten of these are identified here as Cyanophyta
   (Calothrix estromatolitica, Eucapsis jacquesii, Gloeocapsa taverae,
   Microcystis cretacica, and Spirulina noveloi), Chlorophyta (Chlorella
   godinezii, and Tetraedron roldanii), and Bacillariophyta (Fragilaria
   tarahumara, Melosira huepacensis, and Tabellaria sonorensis), based on
   their similarities in form, shape, size, and three dimensional
   arrangement when compared to extant algae. Benthonic or planktonic
   habits of the extant species are thought to be similar to those of the

Title = {Plant communities of the zacatonal alpino area of the Popocatepetl and
   Nevado de Toluca volcanoes in Central Mexico},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This study of the zacatonal alpino zone of the volcanoes Popocatepetl
   (5452 in) and Nevado de Toluca (4690 m) in the central region of the
   Transmexican Volcanic Belt, is a follow-up of the study of ALMEIDA et
   al. (1994). This tropical alpine zacatonal represents the potential
   vegetation of the altitudinal belt between 3950 and 4500 in. These
   altitudinal limits constitute the uppermost limit of Pinus hartwegii
   forests and the lower limit of the periglacial areas that are almost
   without vegetation. On both volcanoes a total of 117 vegetation
   phytosociological relevees were made along the altitudinal gradient.
   They were clustered according to a classification analysis. The
   syntaxonomic scheme of the different units is presented and discussed.
   Special emphasis is given to the association level, aspects such as
   floristic composition, altitudinal zone, distribution and relation with
   environmental factors. Syntaxonomically new is the class Drabo
   jorullensis-Calama-grostietea tolucensis, which includes herbaceous
   formations dominated by tussock grasses, ground rosettes and cushions
   growing on Andosols and Lithosols. This class includes the orders
   Festucetalia lividae (ord. nov.) and Calamagrostietalia tolucensis. The
   first is located above 4150 m, and colonizes umbric Lithosols; the
   latter type of grassland, dense zacatonal formations, is present between
   about 3950 and 4150 m, and preferably on Andosols. The first order
   includes the alliance Plantagino tolucensis-Festucion lividae (all.
   nov.). The vegetation of this alliance is distributed on gentle slopes
   and almost level grounds with intense cryoturbation. This alliance
   comprises two associations, one of which is the new association Drabo
   nivicolae-Plantaginetum tolucensis. The pioneer vegetation consists of
   small tussocks and rosettes, and occurs in zones of colluvial
   accumulation and wind swept passes. It is restricted to Nevado de
   Toluca. The second order includes the new alliance
   Lupinomontani-calamagrostion tolucensis, which comprises the zacatonal
   associations above the pine transition zones of Pinus hartwegii. One out
   of four, the newly described association Lupino
   mexicani-Calamagrostietum tolucensis, is developed on slopes above the
   upper limit of these pine forests, only at Nevado de Toluca.
   A total of 22 families, 42 genera and 61 species of vascular plants are
   presented. The more representative families are Caryophyllaceae,
   Asteraceae, Brassicaceae y Poaceae; among the genera are: Arenaria,
   Calamagrostis, Draba, Festuca, Senecio y Trisetum. Among the species
   with a wide range are: Arenaria bryoides, Calamagrostis tolucensis,
   Draba jorullensis, Senecio procumbens and Trisetum spicatum. More genera
   and species are documented from Nevado de Toluca than from Popocatepetl,
   due to historic-geological, edaphic, topographic and perturbation
   differences. The physiognomically dominant growth forms are the
   tussocks. The xerophytic aspect of the alpine vegetation on these
   volcanoes is determined by low temperatures during the largest part of
   the year, and by dryness which is reflected by the sheath of dry leaves
   of the tussocks. There is no arbustive fringe of transition among the
   sand paths limiting the high monotonous coniferous Pinus hartwegii
   forest and the ``zacatonal alpino{''}.},

Journal = {CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Glutamate plays an important role in osmoprotection in various bacteria.
   In these cases, increased intracellular glutamate pools are not
   attributable to the NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP-GDH) or
   the glutamate synthase, which do not increase their activities under
   hyperosmotic conditions, but rather to changes in other enzymes involved
   in glutamate metabolism. We performed a study which indicates that, as
   opposed to what happens in bacteria, the activity of NADP-GDH is
   fivefold higher when the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii is
   grown in the presence of 1 m NaCl, compared with growth in media with no
   added salt. Since purified NADP-GDH activity in vitro was not enhanced
   by the presence of salt and was more sensitive to ionic strength than
   the two isoenzymes from S. cerevisiae, increased enzyme synthesis is the
   most plausible mechanism to explain our results. We discuss the
   possibility that increased NADP-GDH activity in D. hansenii plays a role
   in counteracting the inhibitory effect of high ionic strength on the
   activity of this enzyme.},

Year = {2004},

Pages = {2159-2174},
Abstract = {In general, according to previous studies, pioneer species do not
   require arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to increase their growth and
   survival in tropical systems. The aim of this study was to determine the
   dependence response to AMF of Heliocarpus appendiculatus, a pioneer
   species, at different phosphorus (P) levels. In a greenhouse experiment,
   H. appendiculatus seedlings were grown in pots with a sterile
   vermiculite-sand mixture (1:1). Two sets of pots were set up: One set
   was inoculated (150 spores per pot) with indigenous AMF from a tropical
   rain forest at ``Los Tuxtlas{''} (Veracruz, Mexico); the other set was
   not inoculated. To each set, 0, 0.02, 0.2, and 2 g L-1 P was added. All
   pots were watered with 250 mL of nutrient solution. Mycorrhizal plants
   showed a higher total dry weight and relative growth rate in 0.02 g L-1
   P concentration, while nonmycorrhizal plants responded positively at 0.2
   g L-1 P; a decrease in plant responses at higher P levels was observed
   in both treatments. H. appendiculatus showed to have higher relative
   dependence at lower P concentration (approximate to50\%). As levels of P
   increased, mycorrhizal colonization decreased. Successful growth of
   pioneer species during succession process may be improved if there is
   AMF content in soils, prior to disturbance.},

Abstract = {Gamma is a simple, but powerful, parallel programming language. Its only
   data structure is the multiset or bag. Banatre and Metayer proposed the
   language as a means to derive sistematically programs in the spirit of
   Dijkstra's discipline of programming. It has been applied to solve
   problems in scheduling, image processing and fractal generation.
   Different operational semantics models for Gamma have been proposed. We
   single out one of them and also produce a denotational semantics for
   which full abstraction is proven with respect to the operational model
   chosen. The result can be used as a basis for a further proof system for
   Gamma.},

Title = {Population dynamics of Mammillaria magnimamma Haworth.
   (Cactaceae) in a lava-field in central Mexico},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {One of the habitats occupied by Mammillaria magnimamma is a 2000-year
   old lava-field, in Mexico City. The great ecological interest on this
   lava-field and the little knowledge there is regarding cacti population
   ecology have compelled us to analyse the demography of this species to
   evaluate its present conservation status at this site. We studied two
   populations of this species within the lava-field: one in a disturbed
   site (i.e., recently burned) and another one in a well preserved site.
   For each population we built two size-based population projection
   matrices (1996/97 and 1997/98). Demographic data were gathered directly
   from observations of plant fates from one year to the next.
   Additionally, seed germination and seedling establishment experiments
   were carried out in the field to estimate fecundity values and seedling
   survival probabilities. The four matrices built were used to perform
   numerical analyses simulating yearly stochastic demographic variation to
   project the overall population's long-term behaviour under these
   changing conditions. Three of the four matrices showed lambda values
   slightly below unity. In these cases elasticity values were highest for
   matrix entries corresponding to plants remaining in their same category.
   The matrix that showed a lambda value above unity (well preserved site,
   1997/98) had higher elasticity values for entries referring to seedling
   survival and growth. The numerical simulations of demographic
   stochasticity showed that the population appears to be growing at a slow
   rate. According to the simulation results, the variation in overall
   population size over time may be accounted for by yearly variation in
   seed germination and seedling survival. Population persistence
   probability might decrease significantly if fire frequency increases.},

Abstract = {Let G be a compact Lie group, X a metric G-space, and exp X the
   hyperspace of all nonempty compact subsets of X endowed with the
   Hausdorff metric topology and with the induced action of G. We prove
   that the following three assertions are equivalent: (a) X is locally
   continuum-connected (resp., connected and locally continuum-connected);
   (b) expX is a G-ANR (resp., a G-AR); (c) (expX)/G is an ANR (resp., an
   AR). This is applied to show that (exp G)/G is an ANR (resp., an AR) for
   each compact (resp., connected) Lie group G. If G is a finite group,
   then (expX)/G is a Hilbert cube whenever X is a nondegenerate Peano
   continuum. Let L(n) be the hyperspace of all centrally symmetric,
   compact, convex bodies A subset of R-n, n greater than or equal to 2,
   for which the ordinary Euclidean unit ball is the ellipsoid of minimal
   volume containing A, and let L-0(n) be the complement of the unique
   O(n)-fixed point in L(n). We prove that: (1) for each closed subgroup H
   subset of O(n), L-0(n)/H is a Hilbert cube manifold; (2) for each closed
   subgroup K subset of O(n) acting non-transitively on Sn-1, the K-orbit
   space L(n)/K and the K-fixed point set L(n){[}K] are Hilbert cubes. As
   an application we establish new topological models for tha Banach-Mazur
   compacta L(n)/O(n) and prove that L-0(n) and (exp Sn-1) n \{S(n-)1\}
   have the same O(n)-homotopy type.},

Abstract = {A distributional analysis of 81 gymnosperm genera was undertaken. On the
   basis of the congruence in the distribution of these genera, nine areas
   of endemism were recognised. Many of these areas also represent areas of
   endemism for other plant and animal taxa. South-western China and New
   Caledonia are particularly interesting from the viewpoint of gymnosperm
   diversity and endemism. The suggested areas of endemism agree in part
   with some floristic regions previously proposed. The congruence between
   the areas of endemism suggested and postulated Pleistocene refuges and
   panbiogeographic nodes is discussed. A cladistic biogeographic analysis
   was carried out and a general area cladogram obtained by strict
   consensus shows two major components, one Gondwanic and the other almost
   Laurasian. This cladogram was compared with previous studies and the
   similarities and differences among relationship areas are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study we used population projection matrices to evaluate the
   conservation status of Neobuxbaumia macrocephala, a columnar cactus
   endemic to a small region in the Tehuacan Valley, in central Mexico.
   Demographic data included 2-year observations on growth, fecundity and
   survival of individuals classified by size. Our results indicate that
   the population is comprised of 70\% juveniles. Population growth rate
   was 0.979 and 0.994 for the 1997/1998 and the 1998/1999 periods,
   respectively. The slight increase in A in 1998/1999 was a result of
   increased fecundity and seedling survival. The highest elasticity values
   correspond to the survival of large/old individuals. Numerical
   simulations were performed by changing the value of particular matrix
   entries and directly evaluating their effect on lambda. Population
   growth rate reached values above unity only when either fecundity or
   seedling survival probability were increased 10-fold. Given these
   limitations for population growth, along with its limited distribution
   range and low population densities, we propose N. macrocephala to be
   classified as a rare species and to promote its conservation by favoring
   management practices aimed to increase germination and seedling
   establishment success. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   and E. variabilis. Some morphological structures of the species observed
   with optical and scanning electron microscopy are presented. The
   distribution of each species over the exoskeleton, as well as the
   occurrence, was recorded for each decapod studied. Specific richness and
   G tests were calculated for all body parts. Epistylis gammari was the
   most widespread species on the surface of C. patzcuarensis, being
   attached to the 13 body parts studied. Seven body parts harboured eight
   species while the gills supported only one species. Epistylid species
   did not show any preference for a particular body region but rather
   utilized the substrate available, and every body part plays an important
   role as a substrate; this is consistent with the value obtained from the
   G test. Epistylid species are already considered as epibionts without
   host or body region but rather utilized the substrate available, and
   every body part plays an important role as a substrate; this is

   not interested in the scientific activity of peripheral areas. The
   history of science is a recent discipline in Mexican historiographic
   studies. The methodological interest in the history of science, the
   creation of schools and institutes that deal with it, the establishment
   of particular chairs, the organization of national societies, and the
   publication of books and periodicals are all very recent. It is
   important to carry out studies in the history of science that examine
   the development of Mexican science introducing the `local' context, and
   study how this development has influenced the formation of scientific
   societies and the development of scientific disciplines in the country.
   We want to explore the introduction of genetics in Mexico as applied to
   agriculture between 1930 and 1960. This matter has not been investigated
   in Mexico and therefore this work would represent one of the first
   studies of this subject and one of the first studies in the general
   field of Mexican scientific history.},

Abstract = {We have performed density functional calculations for three 19-atom
   clusters, two 25-atom clusters, and one 18-atom cluster, each embedded
   in a Madelung potential that takes into account the long-range
   electrostatic interactions of the ion lattice of a NaBr crystal. One of
   the three 19-atom and one of the two 25-atom clusters model bulk
   crystalline NaBr; the others model a Mn2+ impurity trapped in a
   cubically symmetric crystalline electric field (CEF) site of the NaBr
   host. One of the latter has the NaBr bulk interatomic distance, while in
   the others relaxation of the Br atoms around the metallic impurity has
   been considered. The 18-atom cluster models a relaxed Mn impurity Na
   vacancy system. All of our calculated clusters have a Na site at the
   center, and they all include at least first and second nearest-neighbor
   host atoms. In the center of the doped clusters the Mn impurity replaces
   the missing Na ion. The electronic structure of the embedded impurity
   ion in its local environment was computed self-consistently by means of
   ah-electron density functional theory (DFT) techniques. We have examined
   the lattice relaxation around the impurity and calculated the hyperfine
   coupling constants (HFCC). The results for the Mn electronic structure
   and for the HFCC are in agreement with experimental results using
   electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {In mammals and plants, the cell nucleus is organized in dynamic
   macromolecular domains involved in DNA and RNA metabolism. These domains
   can be visualized by light and electron microscopy and their composition
   analyzed by using several cytochemical approaches. They are composed of
   chromatin or ribonucleoprotein structures as interchromatin and
   perichromatin fibers and granules, coiled bodies, and nuclear bodies. In
   plants, DNA arrangement defines chromocentric and reticulated nuclei. We
   used atomic force microscopy to study the in situ structure of the plant
   cell nucleus. Samples of the plants Lacandonia schismatica and Ginkgo
   biloba were prepared as for electron microscopy and unstained semithin
   sections were mounted on glass slides. For comparison, we also examined
   entire normal rat kidney cells using the same approach, Samples were
   scanned with an atomic force microscope working in contact mode.
   Recognizable images of the nuclear envelope, pores, chromatin, and
   nucleolus were observed. Reticulated chromatin was observed in L.
   schismatica. Different textures in the nucleolus of G. biloba were also
   observed, suggesting the presence of nucleolar subcompartments. The
   observation of nuclear structure in situ with the atomic force
   microscope offers a new approach for the analysis of this organelle at
   high resolution. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Journal = {CIENCIAS MARINAS},
Year = {2000},

Abstract = {This work describes the skull development in males and females of the
   California sea lion (Zalophus californianus californianus) examined in
   87 specimens collected in the Gulf of California between 1982 and 1991.
   Forty-three measurements, nine qualitative characters and the number of
   upper-canine-tooth dentine layers, in addition to the natal layer, were
   recorded. Growth parameters were calculated with the van Bertalanffy
   equation and Cartesian distortions were used to schematize the skull
   development. To simplify the description of development, the skull was
   divided into the following parts: (I) braincase, (2) auditive apparatus,
   (3) masticatory apparatus and (4) nasal apparatus. Males with zero tooth
   dentine lasers have skulls slightly smaller than those of females but
   they grow faster. Male skulls grow larger than those of females but the
   older males in the sample examined seem to have bone reduction. The mast
   developed part of the skull at birth is the braincase, which also shows
   the smallest change thereafter. The frontal ridge shows the most changes
   during postnatal growth. The frontal ridge and sagittal crest are
   structures with evident asymmetry. Sexual dimorphism may be recognized
   in the skull proportions since birth. The female skulls grow fairly
   uniform in time, as well as in length and width. In the males, the skull
   grows more in length after birth and more in width thereafter. This
   heterogeneity is more marked in the masticatory apparatus. The capacity
   of bone remodelling in the different parts is not related to their
   degree of sexual dimorphism. The variation in the sample examined shows
   the need to study skull development in relation to geographic and
   environmental variations, as well as in relation to the habits of the
   animals throughout their life.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Lacandonia granules are abundant non-typical extranucleolar
   ribonucleoprotein particles found in the nucleus of Lacandonia
   schismatica, a rare plant showing spatial inversion of sex organs. In
   the present study, changes in the number of Lacandonia granules during
   flower development, and the presence of SR proteins and poly(A)(+) RNA
   in the nuclei of L. schismatica were analyzed by electron microscopy,
   immunoelectron microscopy and ultrastructural in situ hybridization. Our
   results show an important reduction in the number of Lacandonia granules
   in the nuclei of cells of opened (post-anthesis) in relation to unopened
   (pre-anthesis) flowers, where granules are very abundant. The SR family
   of splicing factors and poly(A)(+) RNA are present in both perichromatin
   fibers and Lacandonia granules. The developmental behavior, the presence
   of SR proteins, recently involved in post-splicing events, poly(A)(+)
   RNA and the reported absence of snRNPs splicing factors in Lacandonia
   granules, suggest that these particles are involved in
   postranscriptional events as storage and/or transport of mRNAs. A
   similar situation is present in other nuclear RNP as perichromatin
   granules present in mammals and Balbiani ring granules of salivary
   glands of Chironomus. Based on similarities in morphological,
   developmental behavior, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization
   results, we conclude that Lacandonia, perichromatin and Balbiani ring
   granules may be also functionally similar structures. 2000 (C) Editions

Journal = {PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {151-156},
Abstract = {Flavone contents differed in silks of three maize lines with different
   resistance to larvae of fall amy-worm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda
   Smith, and Southwestern corn borer (SWCB), Diatraea grandiosella Dyar,
   The main compound in the resistant (CML 67) and in the intermediate (CML
   135) lines was apimaysin. In the susceptible line (CML 131) the main
   compound was 3-methoxymaysin, which was absent from the other two lines.
   The same distribution pattern was found in the infested plants, The
   variation in flavone concentration among the 3 lilies and among plants
   infested with Spodoptera frugiperda and Diatraea grandiosella, suggests
   a different defense mechanism of the plant against each of the two
   insects.},

   The genericity conditions needed in that case form a proper subset of
   the usual methods. Moreover some of the conditions are non-intrinsic and
   can be artificially created by action of the automorphism the
   automorphism groups preserving the normal forms near the singularities
   and their action on regular transitions. Hence we introduce an extension
   of the method which treats the usual functional-Pfaffian systems
   together with the;the admissible changes of coordinates in the

   was quantified by determining dry weight over two years. Litter
   interception by palms was 4.4 and 27.1 Mg/ha/yr for the first and second
   years, respectively and accounted for 47.9 and 239.4 percent of the
   reported annual litterfall in the same area. Results showed that litter

Title = {Localization of intranuclear RNA by electron microscopy in situ

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},

Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Background: The presence of RNA in the cell nucleus is well known,
   However, a high resolution in situ hybridization evidence for the
   presence of RNA in some nuclear particles is still lacking, The aim of
   this work is to localize RNA in subnuclear particles using a novel
   ultrastructural in situ hybridization procedure. In this study,
   biotinylated genomic mouse DNA as a probe to localize total RNA in the
   nuclei of mouse hepatocytes was used.
   Methods: The procedure is based on paraformaldehyde fixation and
   embedding in lowicryl resin, Thin sections are mounted in formvar-coated
   gold grids. Hybridization is performed on non-denatured thin sections.
   DNA-RNA hybrids are detected with streptavidin-10 nm gold particles
   complex. By controlling the time of nick-translation during
   incorporation of biotin into the probe, labeling in the fibrillar
   portions of the nucleoplasm is obtained. More digested probes generate
   more labeling in the granular components. Nucleoli were similarly
   labeled.
   Results: As expected, no label was observed in the compact chromatin
   clumps. These results indicate that granular components as perichromatin
   granules in the nucleus contain more processed RNA than fibrillar
   portions, As a comparison, viral DNA sequences on denatured
   RNase-treated thin sections of adenovirus-2 (Ad-2)-infected human cells
   were detected. As previously reported, at late stages DNA was observed
   in the viral particles and surrounding nucleoplasm, where Ad-2 DNA is
   synthesized,
   Conclusions: The present procedure allows the study of intranuclear RNA
   distribution and will be useful for the analysis of RNA processing in
   several types of cells.},

   immune system believed to play a key role in the disease dynamics. In
   this study, we again explore the immune interactions; however from a
   very basic perspective. Our focus is the key first order effects which
   are necessary for a model of HIV-immune interaction to explain the
   different stages of disease progression. Our model is a non-linear
   autonomous ODE system; dependent on several biological parameters. We
   analyze the global dynamics of the system for different sets of
   parameters varied within the proper parameter space. We also include
   numerical simulations of the relevant phase portraits.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the result of an experiment performed with six
   tropical dune species subjected to different nutrient regimes during 90
   days in a greenhouse. Three species are characteristic of beach areas of
   central Gulf of Mexico (Ipomoea pes-caprae, Canavalia rosea. and
   Palafoxia lindenii) while the other three occupy mobile and semi-mobile
   inner dunes (Chamaecrista chamaecristoides, Trachypogon gouini and
   Schizachyrium scoparium). The nutrient treatments were: I) no nutrients,
   2) nutrient rich, 3) predictable nutrient pulses, and d) unpredictable
   nutrient pulses. Plants grown in the absence of nutrients had smaller
   dry weight, leaf area, and relative growth rate than plants in the
   nutrient rich treatment. Nutrient scarcity resulted in a greater biomass
   allocation to roots than to aerial tissue. Plants subjected to nutrient
   pulses showed an intermediate response between the two other treatments,
   though pulse predictability had no significant effect on the growth
   variables measured. Species from the beach showed slower relative growth
   rates but more plasticity in their biomass allocation pattern
   (root/shoot ratio) than species fi om the inner dunes. All species are
   slow-growing and generally show growth responses characteristic of
   plants from infertile habitats. However, they show some phenotypic
   plasticity that enables them to respond to increased nutrient
   availability.},

Abstract = {Leaf decomposition in five common species was studied in the Los Tuxtlas

   Nectandra ambigens (Blake) C. K. Allen, Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria Donn.
   Sm, Dussia mexicana (Standl.) Harms, Ficus yoponensis Desvaux and
   Poulsenia armata (Mig.) Standl. Two experimental studies were done using
   litter bags, one comparing hat and slope conditions, and the second one
   in closed canopy and gap conditions. In addition, decomposition was
   compared between the dry and rainy season.
   There were significant differences in decomposition rates between
   species and seasons, but not between zones (flat and gentle slope, and
   dosed forest and gap conditions). The highest decomposition rates were
   observed for species with high nutrient contents, and also during the
   rainy season. The data were hued to three mathematical models derived
   from the negative simple exponential; the double exponential model for
   decay was significant. Also, the negative, simple, exponential model
   which assumes that k is nor constant, turned out to be significant for
   the experiment in dosed canopy and gap conditions.},

Abstract = {A procedure to study shapes and stability of algebraic models introduced
   by Gilmore is presented. According to the time dependent variational
   principle the coherent states, for algebraic models, are appropriate
   trial wavefunctions. One calculates the expectation value of the
   Hamiltonian with respect to the corresponding coherent states to study
   the energy surfaces of the model. Then equilibrium configurations of the
   resulting energy surface, which depends in general on state variables
   and a set of parameters, are classified through the catastrophe theory.
   For one and two-body interactions in the Hamiltonian of the interacting
   boson model (IBA-1), the critical points are organized through the
   separatrix. As an example, we apply this separatrix to describe the
   energy surfaces associated to the dynamical symmetries of the IBA-1, and
   to the effective hamiltonians of the Ru, Os and Sm isotopes.},

Abstract = {Using the effective Lagrangian approach we study the weak radiative
   processes H-0 --> gamma gamma, mu --> e gamma, tau --> mu gamma, e gamma
   and b --> s gamma. We assume that the full theory is perturbatively
   renormalizable and that nonrenormalizable interactions respects the
   symmetry of the standard model. We consider only those contributions
   generated at lowest level in the perturbative full theory. We find that
   the effects due to new physics may enhance the H --> gamma gamma SM
   decay width and its production in gamma gamma colliders up to one order
   of magnitude. We also get bounds on the fermion-number-nonconserving
   decays nu(i) --> nu(j) gamma and t --> c gamma as well on the anomalous
   electromagnetic couplings of the W boson and the t, c, u quarks.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out on the agonistic behavior of the male volcano
   mouse, Neotomodon alstoni, with 50 pairs of males which were classified
   as possible dominants (D) and subordinates (S), utilizing Melzack -
   Thompson's Method. The aggressiveness levels exhibited by this mouse
   were recording in the combinations: D vs. D and S vs. S. Two groups were
   formed: Group I with 12 pairs of D males and 13 of S males, and Group ii
   with Il pairs of D males and 14 of S males. In Group I the
   aggressiveness level was quantified after one week of mating and after
   another week of isolation, and in Group II the sequence of observation
   was inverted. The aggressiveness level was measured by the number of
   attacks per hour, an attack being defined as the aggressive phisycal
   contac of an animal (aggressor) with another (attacked). The kinds of
   behavior registered, including offense, defense, and submission
   patterns, revealed hierarchic relationships. Dominance was correlated
   significatively (p < 0.05) with a higher level of aggressiveness.},

Title = {Root productivity in a lowland tropical rain forest in Mexico},
Journal = {VEGETATIO},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {123},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-115},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fine root productivity was estimated in a lowland tropical rain forest
   at Los Tuxtlas (SE Mexico) and examined in relation to climatic factors.
   Two root diameter classes were defined (class I, < 1 mm; class II, 1-3
   mm). Total root productivity was estimated to 1.95 t ha(-1) year(-1), a
   value which is lower than those reported from other rain forest sites.
   Significant differences in root dry weight were found among months and
   between diameter classes throughout the year. Class I monthly means
   formed two groups: one corresponding to the months of highest
   precipitation, and the other to the relatively dry season. Class II
   monthly means also formed two groups, although these were unrelated to
   the regional precipitation pattern. A multiplicative regression model of
   productivity on precipitation was significant for both root classes when
   rainfall data of the previous month were used, while a linear regression
   model was significant only for class I roots when temperature data of
   two months before were used; these results suggest a delay in the effect
   of climatic conditions on root productivity. While the seasonal pattern
   of root productivity is clearly related to the annual rainfall
   distribution, the low total annual productivity may be related to the
   very high soil fertility at Los Tuxtlas.},

Abstract = {Well-preserved and abundant carbonized fruits from the Upper Cenozoic
   Pie de Vaca Formation, Puebla, Mexico, reveal the presence of the genus
   Eucommia in southern latitudes of North America during the Neogene. The
   fruits are samaras composed of an elongate, narrow triangular, tapering
   stipe and an elliptic to oval, winged, asymmetrical fruit body that
   contains a seed. Structurally the fruits are formed by two unequally
   developed carpels fused longitudinally by their margins. The carpels are
   distally free and form a laterally displaced notch near the apex of the
   fruit with stigmatic surfaces on its walls. Preserved tissues in the
   fossil fruit are the epidermis with specialized mounds that apparently
   bore a stoma on their apex and a layer of the endocarp composed of cubic
   cells with thickened walls, each containing a cubic crystal. Abundant
   laticifers are associated with the dorsal and marginal carpelary strands
   and form a net that overlies the endocarp, around the seed. Fruits of
   extant Eucommia ulmoides are compared to the fossil fruits, and tissues
   and laticifers equivalent to those preserved in the fossil fruits are
   identified. Comparison between the fruits of Pie de Vaca and other
   fossil fruits revealed similarity with Eucommia montana from Oligocene
   strata of northwestern North America. However, differences in size and
   shape support the recognition of a new species, Eucommia constans
   Magallon-Puebla et Cevallos-Ferriz for the fruits from Pie de Vaca.
   These fruits are currently the youngest report in America and the
   southernmost report worldwide for the genus. The occurrence of Eucommia
   in Upper Cenozoic strata of Mexico modifies previously established
   notions regarding the distribution in space and time of the genus.},

Abstract = {Chamaecrista chamaecristoides is a legume endemic to the coastal sand
   dunes along the coasts of Mexico. Hard-coat dormancy of seeds is broken
   through naturally occurring temperature fluctuations, and seedlings can
   emerge and establish throughout the year. In the study site, winter
   storms (called Nortes) are responsible for moving large quantities of
   sand that bury young seedlings. The objectives of the study were (i) to
   elucidate the timing of seedling emergence, (ii) to investigate the
   effect of date of emergence on seedling survival, and (iii) to evaluate
   different factors of mortality. Seedling survival was monitored under
   natural conditions, from January 1988 to April 1991. Survivorship curves
   were compared using the log-rank Peto and Peto test. It was found that
   the probability of survival or reproduction was not strictly determined
   by chronological age but by size. Larger sized seedlings survived better
   during the Nortes. Timing of germination has a great impact on C.
   chamaecristoides populations, since it affects seedling growth
   possibilities and thus survival and reproduction. In a changing
   environment like the sand dunes, there seems to be a selective advantage
   for maintaining cohorts germinating during different seasons of the
   year.},

Abstract = {In the food industry, where effluents contain very high concentrations
   of dissolved organic matter, in-situ treatment systems have been
   recommended. These systems require simple and inexpensive control
   parameters. According to the literature, to evaluate the system
   performance an inexpensive method is the microscopic observation of
   different protozoal species, combined with personal judgement of
   evaluators. For a four-stage laboratory rotating biological reactor
   treating diluted corn-processing  effluents, ciliated protozoa as
   indicator organisms of system performance were studied. Temperature, pH
   and dissolved oxygen were monitored. Dissolved organics, measured as
   chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD and BOD5), gradually
   decreased along the reactor. Twelve protozoal species were identified.
   From them, 10 have been reported in the literature as commonly found
   inhabitants of aerobic municipal wastewater treatment plants. A
   correlation between six of the species with BOD5 concentrations in the
   wastewaters along the reactor was found.},

Abstract = {An initial study of the hematological values, serum iron and
   2,3-diphosphoglycerate content of wild and laboratory-born (F1) volcano
   mice (Neotomodon alstoni alstoni) is reported. The hematological values
   showed no noticeable differences between wild and F1, mice, nor among
   females and males. However, some small but statistically significative
   differences were found between wild and F1 males in the hematocrit, mean
   corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and in the leukocyte count. 
   The F1 differential leukocyte count showed significantly higher
   percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes, with a concurrent reduction of
   the neutrophil percentage, both in males and in females, compared to the
   wild mice. The comparison of the hematological values of Neotomodon with
   the ones reported for other laboratory rodents, indicates that the
   volcano mouse has a lower erythrocyte corpuscular volume, and hence a
   lower hematocrit value. The hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin,
   mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte count of
   Neotomodon resemble the values published for other rodents. Serum iron
   values are similar in wild and F1 mice, both in males and in females, in
   spite of the different diet. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate content was
   significatively increased in the wild females with respect to males;
   this gender differences does not prevail in the laboratory population,
   which showed levels similar to those exhibited by the wild male mice.},

Title = {PHYSIOLOGICAL-ROLE OF THE PIGMENT OF THE ENAMEL IN THE RODENT INCISORS -
   ITS IMPORTANCE IN EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Journal = {ARCHIVOS DE INVESTIGACION MEDICA},
Year = {1986},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-54},
Abstract = {This paper consists of two parts: The first is an original investigation
   of the physiologic role of the yellow pigment of the incisor teeth
   enamel of rodents. The study was performed in an adequately selected
   experimental model, the golden hamster strain INC (of both sexes), which
   presents color mutants and normally exhibits various combinations of
   incisor teeth with and without pigment. This study has demonstrated
   directly in vivo, for the first time and at the international level,
   that the yellow pigment of the enamel of the incisors of certain groups
   of rodents, have the main function, if not the only one, of increasing
   the hardness of this tissue and of the tooth as a whole. It makes the
   tooth more resistant to mechanical and chemical wear. The second is a
   complete review of the literature on pathologic depigmentation of the
   enamel, caused mainly by nutritional, endocrine and toxic factors. It
   stresses that the importance of depigmentation is not a local pathologic
   change of the enamel, but consists of general pathologic events
   occurring elsewhere, which are important to the organism. The contents
   of this review is thus important to the experimentalist, who examines
   his laboratory rodents clinically, should remember to observe the state
   of the incisor pigment. This makes it possible to uncover previously
   undetected nutritional factors which could be causing the
   depigmentation. Such generalized pathologic changes, occurring
   concomitantly with dental depigmentation, constitute an aspect of the
   highest interest for experimental biology and medicine.},

   mapping},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Let X be a compact metric space. By 2(X) we denote the hyperspace of all
   closed and non-empty subsets of X endowed with the Hausdorff metric. Let
   f: X -> X be a continuous function. We study some topological properties
   of the hyperspace omega(f), the collection of all omega limits sets w
   (x, f) with x is an element of X. We prove the following: (i) If X has
   no isolated points, then, for every continuous function f: X -> X,
   int(2)(X) (omega(f)) = empty set. (ii) If X is a dendrite for which
   every arc contains a free arc and f: X -> X is transitive, then the
   hyperspace omega(f) is totally disconnected. (iii) Let D-infinity be the
   Wazewski's universal dendrite. Then there exists a transitive continuous
   function f: D-infinity -> D-infinity for which the hyperspace omega( f )
   contains an arc; hence, omega( f ) is not totally disconnected.},

Title = {Bioinformatics Study and Genomic Analysis of the Lassa Virus Envelope
   Glycoproteins},
Journal = {CURRENT ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 5},
Abstract = {Background The Lassa virus has been endemic throughout Africa since the
   1960s. It is the causative agent of Lassa fever, which annually impacts
   between 100,000 and 300,000 individuals, predominantly in West Africa,
   leading to over 5,000 deaths. Infected rodents transmit the disease,
   when they come into contact with contaminated food or goods. The overall
   mortality rate is approximately 1\%, but it increases to 15\% in severe
   cases. Pregnant women in their third trimester are especially vulnerable
   to the condition, with a higher risk of fatality.Objective The purpose
   of this project is to create computer-based techniques for analyzing
   Lassa virus envelope glycoproteins and distinguishing them from other
   groups of proteins.Methods We employed a range of software programs,
   including specialized computational genomics software, to assess the
   probability of each glycoprotein sequence being intrinsically
   disordered. We achieved this by analyzing the Protein Intrinsic Disorder
   Profile (PIDP) and its polarity profile using PIM 3.0v (Protein
   Intrinsic Mobility).Results We examined the PIM 3.0v and PIDP profiles,
   which revealed clear patterns in the envelope glycoproteins of the Lassa
   virus. These patterns made it easier to recognize structural and
   morphological similarities among these proteins.Conclusions PIM 3.0v can
   distinguish Lassa virus glycoproteins and may be useful for
   identification. This study advances bioinformatics and disease control
   by improving our understanding of the Lassa virus. Our web database
   investigation shows that the PIM 3.0v profile can identify this group.},

Title = {Thermosensitive Porcine Myocardial Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel Coupled
   with Proanthocyanidins for Cardiac Tissue Engineering},
Journal = {GELS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Currently, there are no therapies that prevent the negative myocardial
   remodeling process that occurs after a heart attack. Injectable
   hydrogels are a treatment option because they may replace the damaged
   extracellular matrix and, in addition, can be administered minimally
   invasively. Reactive oxygen species generated by ischemia-reperfusion
   damage can limit the therapeutic efficacy of injectable hydrogels. In
   order to overcome this limitation, grape seed proanthocyanidins were
   incorporated as antioxidant compounds into a thermosensitive myocardial
   extracellular matrix hydrogel in this study. For the fabrication of the
   hydrogel, the extracellular matrix obtained by decellularization of
   porcine myocardium was solubilized through enzymatic digestion, and the
   proanthocyanidins were incorporated. After exposing this extracellular
   matrix solution to 37 degrees C, it self-assembled into a hydrogel with
   a porous structure. According to the physicochemical and biological
   evaluation, the coupling of proanthocyanidins in the hydrogel has a
   positive effect on the antioxidant capacity, gelation kinetics, in vitro
   degradation, and cardiomyocyte viability, indicating that the hydrogel
   coupled with this type of antioxidants represents a promising
   alternative for potential application in post-infarction myocardial
   regeneration. Furthermore, this study proposes the best concentrations
   of proanthocyanidins that resulted in the hydrogels for future studies
   in cardiac tissue engineering.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNGI},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Efficient transcriptional regulation of the stress response is critical
   for microorganism survival. In yeast, stress-related gene expression,
   particularly for antioxidant enzymes like catalases, mitigates reactive
   oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), preventing cell damage.
   The halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii shows oxidative stress
   tolerance, largely due to high catalase activity from DhCTA and DhCTT
   genes. This study evaluates D. hansenii's response to oxidative stress
   caused by H2O2 under saline conditions, focusing on cell viability, gene
   expression, and catalase activity. Chromatin organization in the
   promoter of DhCTA and DhCTT was analyzed, revealing low nucleosome
   occupancy in promoter regions, correlating with active gene expression.
   Stress-related motifs for transcription factors like Msn2/4 and Sko1
   were found, suggesting regulation by the DhHog1 MAP kinase. Analysis of
   a Dhhog1 Delta mutant showed DhHog1's role in DhCTA expression under
   H2O2 or NaCl conditions. These findings highlight DhHog1's critical role
   in regulating the stress response in D. hansenii, offering insights for
   enhancing stress tolerance in halotolerant yeasts, particularly for
   industrial applications in saline wastewater management.},

Title = {Modelling the present and future of Phrynosoma orbiculare
   habitat and wildfire distribution and their environmental niche overlap
   in Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {Wildfires are natural phenomena that have shaped ecosystems and
   maintained biodiversity for millions of years. However, the increased
   frequency and severity of wildfires in recent decades are predominantly
   attributed to human activities. These anthropogenic factors, including
   land use change, climate change, and fire suppression, have disrupted
   the natural fire regime and heightened the risk of large-scale,
   destructive wildfires. Reptiles, as ectothermic and often slow-moving
   animals, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of fires due to
   their limited mobility and reliance on specific microhabitats.
   Understanding the impacts of wildfires on reptile populations is crucial
   for their effective conservation and management in fire-prone areas.
   This paper focuses on Phrynosoma orbiculare, a species distributed
   across the northern and southeastern regions of Mexico, where wildfires
   are common. The study revealed that key environmental variables driving
   the distribution of P. orbiculare include altitude, temperature
   extremes, and forest composition, while fire occurrence is strongly
   influenced by climatic conditions such as temperature and precipitation.
   As fires become more frequent and severe, the niche overlap between P.
   orbiculare and fire-prone regions is expected to expand. These findings
   highlight the importance of integrating fire management into
   conservation planning, particularly for protecting fire-sensitive
   ecosystems like Abies forests. Understanding the complex interaction
   between fire and species distributions is essential for developing
   effective conservation strategies that ensure the survival of P.
   orbiculare and other fire-sensitive species in Mexico's changing
   landscapes.},

Title = {Assessing functional connectivity and anthropogenic impacts on
   Ambystoma altamirani populations in Bosque De Agua, Central
   Mexico},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Ambystoma altamirani is a microendemic amphibian limited to central
   Mexico, specifically the Bosque de Agua region in the Trans-Mexican
   Volcanic Belt, renowned for its endemic amphibian species. Anthropogenic
   activities such as land use change, water pollution, and the
   introduction of exotic species such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) have substantially transformed its habitat, creating barriers
   that fragment it and impeding the mobility of the species and
   connectivity with other populations. This fragmentation poses
   challenges, including emerging diseases, inbreeding, limited gene flow,
   and a loss of genetic diversity, placing Ambystoma altamirani in
   national and international risk categories. The present study utilized
   the ENMeval and biomod2 models for environmental niche modeling (ENM) to
   assess the potential distribution of Ambystoma altamirani in the Bosque
   de Agua region. The key supporting variables include rivers, lakes,
   altitude, and a combination of Abies and Pinus forests, while the
   detrimental factors include urbanization and agriculture. Employing
   circuit theory (CT) and least-cost path (LCP) methodologies, this
   research explored functional connectivity, identifying core areas in the
   central region of Bosque de Agua. As migration distance decreases, the
   number of corridors facilitating population flow decreases. In the
   concluding phase, an analysis assessed the coincidence of state and
   federal Mexican Natural Protected Areas with core areas, revealing a
   lack of protection. The results of this study could lead to improved
   knowledge about Ambystoma altamirani, providing valuable tools for
   helping stakeholders formulate comprehensive strategies for species
   conservation.},

Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {We introduce a novel lattice-gas cellular automaton (LGCA) for
   compressible vectorial active matter with polar and nematic velocity
   alignment. Interactions are, by construction, zero-range. For polar
   alignment, we show the system undergoes a phase transition that promotes
   aggregation with strong resemblance to the classic zero-range process.
   We find that above a critical point, the states of a macroscopic
   fraction of the particles in the system coalesce into the same state,
   sharing the same position and momentum (polar condensate). For nematic
   alignment, the system also exhibits condensation, but there exist
   fundamental differences: a macroscopic fraction of the particles in the
   system collapses into a filament, where particles possess only two
   possible momenta. Furthermore, we derive hydrodynamic equations for the
   active LGCA model to understand the phase transitions and condensation
   that undergoes the system. We also show that generically the discrete
   lattice symmetries-e.g. of a square or hexagonal lattice-affect
   drastically the emergent large-scale properties of on-lattice active
   systems. The study puts in evidence that aligning active matter on the
   lattice displays new behavior, including phase transitions to states
   that share similarities to condensation models.},

Abstract = {Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)
   diagnostic methods have a large potential to effectively detect
   SARS-CoV-2 with sensitivity and specificity nearing 100\%, comparable to
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Yet, there is room for
   improvement. Commonly, one guide CRISPR RNA (gRNA) is used to detect the
   virus DNA and activate Cas collateral activity, which cleaves a reporter
   probe. In this study, we demonstrated that using 2-3 gRNAs in parallel
   can create a synergistic effect, resulting in a 4.5 x faster cleaving
   rate of the probe and increased sensitivity compared to using individual
   gRNAs. The synergy is due to the simultaneous activation of
   CRISPR-Cas12a and the improved performance of each gRNA. This approach
   was able to detect as few as 10 viral copies of the N-gene of SARS-CoV-2
   RNA after a preamplification step using reverse transcription
   loop-mediated isothermal amplification. The method was able to
   accurately detect 100\% of positive and negative clinical samples in
   similar to 25 min using a fluorescence plate reader and similar to 45
   min with lateral flow strips.},

   monkeys (CM) and 15 wild individuals (WM) from groups living in
   fragments with different compositions and vegetation structures (height,
   density, canopy width) in flooded and non-flooded areas. Low microbial
   diversity in CM and WM from the flooded area was observed while in WM
   from the non-flooded area, there was a higher microbial diversity and
   evenness. Free-ranging monkeys from different areas showed a significant
   difference in the replacement of morphospecies of gut microbiota (p =
   0.0006); however, the bacterial communities are not differentiated as
   particular entities. The intestinal microbial community can be an
   indicator of howler monkeys' health and habitat quality. The change in
   the composition of the plant community into small landscape scales, as
   well as fragmentation and natural heterogeneity of the landscape, can
   affect the intestinal microbial community of howler monkeys.},

Title = {Alternative CUG Codon Usage in the Halotolerant Yeast Debaryomyces
   hansenii: Gene Expression Profiles Provide New Insights into
   Ambiguous Translation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNGI},

Abstract = {The halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii belongs to the CTG-Ser1
   clade of fungal species that use the CUG codon to translate as leucine
   or serine. The ambiguous decoding of the CUG codon is relevant for
   expanding protein diversity, but little is known about the role of
   leucine-serine ambiguity in cellular adaptations to extreme
   environments. Here, we examine sequences and structures of tRNA(CAG)
   from the CTG-Ser1 clade yeasts, finding that D. hansenii conserves the
   elements to translate ambiguously. Then, we show that D. hansenii has
   tolerance to conditions of salinity, acidity, alkalinity, and oxidative
   stress associated with phenotypic and ultrastructural changes. In these
   conditions, we found differential expression in both the logarithmic and
   stationary growth phases of tRNA(Ser), tRNA(Leu), tRNA(CAG), LeuRS, and
   SerRS genes that could be involved in the adaptive process of this
   yeast. Finally, we compare the proteomic isoelectric points and
   hydropathy profiles, detecting that the most important variations among
   the physicochemical characteristics of D. hansenii proteins are in their
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the medium. We propose
   that the ambiguous translation, i.e., leucylation or serynation, on
   translation of the CUG-encoded residues, could be linked to adaptation
   processes in extreme environments.},

Title = {A Photon Force and Flow for Dissipative Structuring: Application to
   Pigments, Plants and Ecosystems},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Through a modern derivation of Planck's formula for the entropy of an
   arbitrary beam of photons, we derive a general expression for entropy
   production due to the irreversible process of the absorption of an
   arbitrary incident photon spectrum in material and its dissipation into
   an infrared-shifted grey-body emitted spectrum, with the rest being
   reflected or transmitted. Employing the framework of Classical
   Irreversible Thermodynamic theory, we define the generalized
   thermodynamic flow as the flow of photons from the incident beam into
   the material and the generalized thermodynamic force is, then, the
   entropy production divided by the photon flow, which is the entropy
   production per unit photon at a given wavelength. We compare the entropy
   production of different inorganic and organic materials (water, desert,
   leaves and forests) under sunlight and show that organic materials are
   the greater entropy-producing materials. Intriguingly, plant and
   phytoplankton pigments (including chlorophyll) reach peak absorption
   exactly where entropy production through photon dissipation is maximal
   for our solar spectrum 430 <lambda < 550 nm, while photosynthetic
   efficiency is maximal between 600 and 700 nm. These results suggest that
   the evolution of pigments, plants and ecosystems has been towards
   optimizing entropy production, rather than photosynthesis. We propose
   using the wavelength dependence of global entropy production as a
   biosignature for discovering life on planets of other stars.},

Abstract = {We surveyed a subsurface layer of saturated mobile mud and its microbial
   fingerprints below the desiccated bottom of a maar lake at Rincon de
   Parangueo (RP), Mexico. A multi-scale approach was followed using
   geological fieldwork, coring of the sediments, ground penetrating radar
   survey, physico-chemical characterization including X-ray diffraction
   and scanning electron microscope, and high-throughput DNA sequencing
   methods. The mobile mud is an organic-rich silty clay, with high values
   of alkalinity, volumetric water content and conductivity. Mud mobility
   has been attributed to overpressure caused by disequilibrium compaction
   of sediments related to active subsidence and pore overpressure produced
   by an input of groundwater and gas content in the sediments and resulted
   in a diverse set of structures related to mud tectonics such as
   injection domes and fluid seeps through fractures. Extraction and
   sequencing of sedimentary environmental DNA in the mud layer were
   performed for Bacteria and Archaea. Despite the small number of samples
   ob-tained, the microbial fingerprint from the sedimentary environmental
   DNA at subsurface shares similarities with the microbial communi-ties
   identified on the crater surface. Additionally, we identify the DNA of
   specific methanogenic microorganisms in the mud, such as Bathyarchaeia,
   Methanomassiliicoccales, and Methanobacteriales, and we speculate on
   their probable role in gas production and pore overpressure in the mud
   layer. The underground mud at Rincon de Parangueo represents a
   geologically dynamic environment with conditions that are favorable for
   the thriving of microbial communities.},

Journal = {CELLS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary
   brain tumor. The enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which
   participates in the rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism through
   the kynurenine pathway (KP), is associated with poor prognosis in
   patients with GBM. The metabolites produced after tryptophan oxidation
   have immunomodulatory properties that can support the immunosuppressor
   environment. In this study, mRNA expression, protein expression, and
   activity of the enzyme kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) were analyzed in
   GBM cell lines (A172, LN-18, U87, U373) and patient-derived astrocytoma
   samples. KMO mRNA expression was assessed by real-time RT-qPCR, KMO
   protein expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and
   immunofluorescence, and KMO activity was determined by quantifying
   3-hydroxykynurenine by HPLC. Heterogenous patterns of both KMO
   expression and activity were observed among the GBM cell lines, with the
   A172 cell line showing the highest KMO expression and activity. Higher
   KMO mRNA expression was observed in glioma samples than in patients
   diagnosed with only a neurological disease; high KMO mRNA expression was
   also observed when using samples from patients with GBM in the TCGA
   program. The KMO protein expression was localized in GFAP(+) cells in
   tumor tissue. These results suggest that KMO is a relevant target to be
   explored in glioma since it might play a role in supporting tumor
   metabolism and immune suppression.},

   be used to restore populations. In three L. autumnalis populations, we
   selected five small (one inflorescence), five medium-sized (one
   inflorescence), and five big (two inflorescences) plants. In each plant,
   we marked 8?10 pseudobulb along a growth chain (two in big plants);
   pseudobulb/leaves were measured (wide, height, length), and their
   biomass was estimated. We removed the latest two (in large plants, the
   harvest was done in one chain, and the other was a control). The removed
   pseudobulbs were tied in the same tree. Nutrient content was higher in
   leaves. No plant died because of the pseudobulb?s harvest; 55\% produced
   new pseudobulbs yearly. Among the big plants, pseudobulb production was
   constant (87\%) in the control chains but not in the chains subject to
   harvest; in these, inflorescence production was lower. Four removed
   sections died, and <40\% developed new pseudobulbs yearly. The harvest
   of the most recent two pseudobulbs diminish the growth and reproduction
   of L. autumnalis, and after two years, the plants did not recover the
   lost biomass. Removed sections can be used to restore populations, but
   these must be assisted with nutrients and watering.},

Abstract = {We used histological techniques to describe the morphology of the yolk
   and pericardial sacs in developing embryos of the lecithotrophic species
   Girardinus creolus, Gambusia puncticulata, Limia vittata, and Quintana
   atrizona, in comparison with the extreme matrotrophic Heterandria
   formosa. In lecithotrophic species, the yolk sac was enlarged and lasted
   until the final stages of development, while in H. formosa it was
   completely absorbed soon after fertilization. Lecithotrophic poeciliids
   showed a pericardial sac with a single layer of blood vessels covering
   the dorsal surface of the cephalic region only, while H. formosa showed
   a more complex largely vascularized pericardial sac covering the entire
   dorsal surface, except the caudal region. In advanced gestation of G.
   creolus, a vascular plexus of the yolk sac reaches the pharyngeal
   region, behind the gills, suggesting that the pharynx may play a role in
   embryonic nutrition in lecithotrophic species. These morphological
   evidences suggest that matrotrophy derives from lecithotrophy.},

   Acid Levels and Improves Cognitive Performance in Mice},
Journal = {ANTIOXIDANTS},

Abstract = {The tryptophan (Trp) metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an alpha
   7-nicotinic and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist. Elevated brain
   KYNA levels are commonly seen in psychiatric disorders and
   neurodegenerative diseases and may be related to cognitive impairments.
   Recently, we showed that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits kynurenine
   aminotransferase II (KAT II), KYNA's key biosynthetic enzyme, and
   reduces KYNA neosynthesis in rats in vivo. In this study, we examined if
   repeated systemic administration of NAC influences brain KYNA and
   cognitive performance in mice. Animals received NAC (100 mg/kg, i.p.)
   daily for 7 days. Redox markers, KYNA levels, and KAT II activity were
   determined in the brain. We also assessed the effect of repeated NAC
   treatment on Trp catabolism using brain tissue slices ex vivo. Finally,
   learning and memory was evaluated with and without an acute challenge
   with KYNA's bioprecursor L-kynurenine (Kyn; 100 mg/kg). Subchronic NAC
   administration protected against an acute pro-oxidant challenge,
   decreased KYNA levels, and lowered KAT II activity and improved memory
   both under basal conditions and after acute Kyn treatment. In tissue
   slices from these mice, KYNA neosynthesis from Trp or Kyn was reduced.
   Together, our data indicate that prolonged treatment with NAC may
   enhance memory at least in part by reducing brain KYNA levels.},

Abstract = {The early evolution of life is a period with many important events with
   a lot of big and open questions. One of them is the evolution of
   metabolic pathways, which means the origin and assembly of enzymes that
   act together. The retrograde hypothesis was the first attempt to explain
   the origin and evolutionary history of metabolic pathways; Norman
   Horowitz developed this first significant hypothesis. This idea was
   followed by relevant proposals developed by Sam Granick, who proposed
   the ``forward direction hypothesis,{''} and then the successful idea of
   ``Patchwork{''} assembly proposed independently by Martynas Ycas and Roy
   Jensen. Since then, a few new hypotheses were proposed; one of the most
   influential was made by Antonio Lazcano and Stanley Miller in the
   Journal Molecular Evolution, the ``semi-enzymatic origin{''} of
   metabolic pathways. This article was cited more than 160 times,
   including in most papers published about the early evolution of
   metabolism, placing it as influential work in the field. The ideas
   proposed in this work and their effects on studying the origin and early
   evolution of life are analyzed.},

Volume = {63},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Castilleja tenuiflora is a facultative root hemiparasitic plant that has
   colonized a disturbed lava field in central Mexico. To determine the
   effects of hemiparasitism on the population dynamics of the parasite, we
   identified a set of potential hosts and quantified their effects on the
   vital rates of C. tenuiflora during 2016-2018. Connections between the
   roots of the hemiparasite and the hosts were confirmed with a scanning
   electron microscope. Annual matrices considering two conditions (with
   and without potential hosts) were built based on vital rates for each
   year, and annual stochastic finite rate growth rates (lambda(s)) were
   calculated. Plants produced more reproductive structures with hosts than
   without hosts. A Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) was performed to
   compare the contributions of vital rates between conditions. We
   identified 19 species of potential hosts for this generalist
   hemiparasite. Stochastic lambda with hosts lambda(s) = 1.02 (CI =
   0.9999, 1.1) tended to be higher than without them lambda(s) = 0.9503
   (CI = 0.9055, 0.9981). The highest elasticity values correspond to
   survival. LTRE indicated that the most important parameters are survival
   and fecundity; the total contribution of fecundity (0.0192) to the
   difference in growth was three times lower than that of survival
   (0.0603). Piqueria trinervia was the most abundant host, and C.
   tenuiflora had a higher lambda with it than with other species.
   Individuals can grow alone, but hosts can have a positive effect on the
   vital parameters of C. tenuiflora and on lambda.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a system to measure current in the range of
   0 to 10 mu A with high-voltage isolation up to 5 kV. This current
   monitor consists of three ammeters connected in series, to improve the
   resolution in the measurement. The design features several innovative
   elements such as using low voltage to provide power to the devices to
   measure the current and digitize it with a sampling frequency of 1 KHz,
   it is generated based on a DC-DC converter that produces three voltages,
   +12 V, -12 V, and 5 V, from a conventional 10 V source. The three
   voltages are referenced to the same floating ground. The DC-DC converter
   has a high voltage insulation up to 5 kV and four optocouplers with an
   insulation up to 20 kV are used to read the digitized data. The
   introduction of a DC-DC converter contributed to reduce the noise level
   in the analog part of the circuit which has been resolved implementing
   shields inside the board. In particle physics, several systems are used
   to detect particles in high-energy physics experiments such as Gas
   Electron Multiplier (GEM), micromegas, etc. GEMs suffer small
   deteriorations due to discharges in constant operation and require
   monitoring the current consumption at high frequency (1 kHz). In this
   work, we present the design and operation of a 0 to 10 mu A auto scale
   ammeter. The results obtained by monitoring the current in a 10 x 10
   cm(2) GEM are shown.},

Title = {Deep microbial community profiling along the fermentation process of
   pulque, a biocultural resource of Mexico},
Journal = {MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The biggest non-tree perennial plant species endemic to Mexico were
   called metl in the Nahua culture; during colonial times, renamed with
   the Antillean word maguey. Carl von Linne ` finally renamed them as
   Agave, a Greek-Latin root word meaning admirable. Since pre-Columbian
   times, one of the major products obtained from some Agave species is the
   fermented beverage called pulque or octli. This beverage represents an
   ancient biotechnological development obtained by the natural
   fermentation of mead from such plants. Pulque played a central role in
   Mexican pre-Columbian cultures, while in recent times, there has been a
   renewed interest in it, due to its high content in nutrients and
   probiotics. In this study, we used massive sequencing of the 16S rRNA
   gene and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to profile the
   pulque microbiome. We identified 2,855 bacteria operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) and 1,494 fungi species in the pulque fermentation. Our
   results provide the most diverse catalog of microbes during pulque
   production reported so far. These findings allowed us to identify
   previously unidentified and core microbes resilient during pulque
   production, with the potential to be used as fermentation stage
   biomarkers. We confirmed previous reports of pulque microbes and
   discovered new ones like the bacteria Sphingomonas and Weisella. Among
   fungi we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae was second to Candida
   zemplina in the studied pulque samples.},

Abstract = {In this work, the dynamical properties of a Leslie-Tanner predator-prey
   model are analyzed. A method is provided to find the regions in the
   parameter space where Bautin, Hopf and simultaneous supercritical Hopf
   bifurcations exist. A remarkable feature of the dynamics of the model is
   the existence of tristability. In fact, the system simultaneously
   presents three stable limit cycles. These results generalize some
   previous knowledge on the subject since both prey defense and a
   generalist predator are incorporated in our analysis.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase TOR recruits
   different subunits to assemble the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1
   (TORC1), which is inhibited by rapamycin and regulates ribosome
   biogenesis, autophagy, and lipid metabolism by regulating the expression
   of lipogenic genes. In addition, TORC1 participates in the cell cycle,
   increasing the length of the G2 phase. In the present work, we
   investigated the effect of rapamycin on cell growth, cell morphology and
   neutral lipid metabolism in the phytopathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis.
   Inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin induced the formation of septa that
   separate the nuclei that were formed after mitosis. Regarding neutral
   lipid metabolism, a higher accumulation of triacylglycerols was not
   detected, but the cells did contain large lipid bodies, which suggests
   that small lipid bodies became fused into big lipid droplets. Vacuoles
   showed a similar behavior as the lipid bodies, and double labeling with
   Blue-CMAC and BODIPY indicates that vacuoles and lipid bodies were
   independent organelles. The results suggest that TORC1 has a role in
   cell morphology, lipid metabolism, and vacuolar physiology in U. maydis.},

Abstract = {Given a collection of pairwise co-prime integers m(1), ..., m(r) > 1, we

   Sigma(mi) is the m(i)-adic solenoid. Answering a question of D. P.
   Bellamy and J. M. Lysko, we prove that if M is a subcontinuum of Sigma
   such that the projections of M on each Sigma(mi) are onto, then for each
   open subset U in Sigma with M subset of U, there exists an open
   connected subset V of Sigma such that M subset of V subset of U, i.e.
   any such M is ample in the sense of Prajs and Whittington (2007). This
   contrasts with the property of Cartesian squares of fixed solenoids
   Sigma(mi) x Sigma(mi), whose diagonals are never ample (Bellamy and
   Lysko, 2014).},

   fish},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Male mate discrimination may be affected by the social environment
   (presence or absence of rival males or mates), which can also affect
   stress and sex hormones (e.g., cortisol and 11-ketotestosterone
   (11-KT)). The Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa, is an all-female fish
   species dependent on sperm from mating with male P. latipinna. We
   investigated male mate choice in P. latipinna between conspecific
   females and P. formosa with a rival male present and no rival male
   present. We measured cortisol and 11-KT release rates from all fish. The
   presence of a rival male had no effect on male mate choice for
   conspecific females nor overall mating effort. Male 11-KT decreased on
   the second day after exposure to a rival male on the first day. Focal
   male 11-KT is positively correlated with the size of the rival male.
   Both conspecific and heterospecific females released more 11-KT when in
   the rival male treatment than when not. Neither male nor female cortisol
   was affected by the presence or absence of the rival male. We did not
   find an effect of rival males on male mate choice in contrast to our
   prediction. Instead, our findings may indicate a hormonal response to
   social competition.},

   landscape-scale habitat amount and habitat spatial configuration on the
   number of individuals and genetic diversity of P. robertsi. Given its
   low vagility, we expected stronger responses to local habitat amount
   than to landscape variables, with habitat configuration showing the
   weakest effects on all responses. Methods Using multiscale and
   multimodel inference approaches, we tested the relative effect of local
   habitat amount (fallen logs volume), landscape habitat amount (forest
   cover) and landscape configuration (forest edge density and forest
   fragmentation per se) on the number of salamanders and its genetic
   diversity. Results The number of individuals was more strongly related
   to local and landscape variables than genetic diversity. As predicted,
   local habitat amount showed stronger positive effects on number of
   individuals and number of alleles than forest cover. In addition, all
   response variables increased in landscapes with lower edge density.
   Fragmentation per se showed weak influence on all responses. Conclusions
   Fallen logs volume is a major driver of this forest-specialist
   salamander. Yet, edge density also shapes salamander populations,
   especially the number of individuals. Retaining fallen logs in forests
   and increasing forest core areas are critical for salamander
   conservation.},

Title = {Seed mass equalises the strength of positive and negative plant-plant
   interactions in a semi-arid grassland},

Volume = {190},

Pages = {287-296},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The interplay and balance between positive and negative interactions are
   important and recurrent topics in plant ecology. If facilitation occurs
   because benefactors ameliorate stress, such balance may be driven by
   seed mass because stress tolerance and competitive ability of plants,
   particularly seedlings, are positively correlated with seed mass. Thus,
   small-seeded, stress-intolerant species may require facilitation, but
   not large-seeded ones. This would equalise the magnitudes of
   opposite-signed interactions because in small-seeded species, positive
   effects of facilitators and negative effects of competitors should be
   strong, while both effects should be weak in large-seeded species. To
   test this idea, we assessed the effects of interactions with four
   associated species on different components of the performance of ten
   focal species. As expected, the largest facilitative and competitive
   effects were recorded in small-seeded species, and positive interactions
   had similar magnitudes to negative ones for any given seed mass,
   especially when performance was integrated into lifelong fitness.
   Furthermore, the fact that small-seeded species seem to be strongly
   facilitated may explain why they are not outcompeted by large-seeded
   species. This is an alternative to other hypotheses explaining the
   coexistence of plants with different-sized seeds. The close balance
   between opposite-signed interactions in the presence of stress may also
   explain why interactions have strong effects on individuals (that
   interact with only a few species), but seemingly weaker effects on
   populations, where interactions between many species would cancel out.},

Title = {Complex patterns of hybridization and introgression across evolutionary
   timescales in Mexican whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {284-295},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Identifying patterns of introgression across the tree of life is
   foundational to understanding general mechanisms that govern the impacts
   of gene flow on the speciation process. There are few vertebrate groups
   in which hybridization is associated with as large a diversity of
   outcomes as in North American whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis). Of
   particular interest is that hybridization among divergent whiptail
   species has repeatedly led to the formation of unisexual
   (parthenogenetic) lineages. Understanding the hybrid origin of these
   unisexual lineages requires an accurate understanding of species
   boundaries among gonochoristic whiptails. Doing so has historically been
   an extremely challenging problem which, in part, may be a consequence of
   widespread hybridization and incomplete reproductive isolation among
   lineages. The lack of a robust phylogenetic framework and uncertainty in
   species boundaries precludes studies of general patterns and mechanisms
   of introgression among whiptail species. Here, we use genomic data to
   reconstruct a robust estimate of evolutionary history in the largest
   clade of whiptail lizards (A. sexlineatus species group) and use it to
   identify patterns of introgression. Our results indicate substantial
   introgressive hybridization and admixture has occurred among multiple
   lineages of whiptails across diverse evolutionary time scales, and
   illustrate their impact on phylogenetic inference. Thus, hybridization
   among whiptail species appears to have been a prominent feature
   throughout their evolutionary history, which could, in part, explain why
   parthenogenesis has evolved so many times in whiptails in comparison to
   other vertebrate groups.},

Abstract = {All known alarmones are ribonucleotides or ribonucleotide derivatives

   distribution, and functional role in highly conserved cellular processes
   support the possibility that these modified nucleotides are molecular

Title = {Endogamy costs and reproductive biology of Laelia autumnalis, an

Number = {12},
Pages = {1423-1434},

Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the fitness of selfed progeny must be
   lowered by inbreeding depression. Most research into the breeding
   systems of orchids shows a similar fruit set from outcrossing and
   self-pollination, but few studies have measured seed production and
   viability. In five populations of Laelia autumnalis, in central Mexico,
   we studied the species reproductive system and the early costs of
   endogamy. We performed spontaneous self-pollination, apomixis, assisted
   self-pollination, cross-pollination, and exogamous pollination (using
   pollen from a different population) treatments of bagged flowers and
   measured fruit set, seed production, and germination. No fruits were
   produced in the apomixis and spontaneous self-pollination treatments.
   Reproductive success from self-pollination was lower than that from
   cross- and exogamous pollination and no difference was found between the
   latter two treatments. The ratio between self-pollination and
   cross-pollination success in different traits ranged from 0.80 +/- 0.18
   (fruit set) to 0.22 +/- 0.13 (seeds with embryo). The latter value
   suggests a high endogamy costs in the production of viable seeds. The
   concatenated success of the different traits studied showed that the
   relative fitness of self-pollination was 63\% lower than with
   cross-pollination. Laelia autumnalis is a self-compatible non-autogamous
   species in which the cost of endogamy occurs at seed production and
   cannot be compensated for at other early stages. This also occurs in
   other orchid species and is likely to be a general pattern.},

Abstract = {Of the six known autotrophic pathways, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WL)
   is the only one present in both the acetate producing Bacteria
   (homoacetogens) and the methane producing Archaea (hydrogenotrophic
   methanogens), and it has been suggested that WL is one of the oldest
   metabolic pathways. However. only the so-called carbonyl branch is
   shared by Archaea and Bacteria, while the methyl branch is different,
   both in the number of reactions and enzymes, which are not homologous
   among them. In this work we show that some parts of the methyl branch of
   archaeal Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (MBWL) arc present in bacteria as well
   as in non-methanogen archaea, although the tangled evolutionary history
   of MBWL cannot be traced back to the Last Common Ancestor. We have also
   analyzed the different variants of methanogenesis (hydrogenotrophic,
   acetoclastic and methylotrophic pathways), and concluded that each of
   these pathways, and every different enzyme or subunit (in the case of
   multimeric enzymes), has their own intricate evolutionary history. Our
   study supports the scenario of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis being
   older than the other variants, albeit not old enough to be present in
   the last archaeal common ancestor.},

Abstract = {Between 2008 and 2010, 27 acoustic tags were applied to various age and
   reproductive classes of grey whales in Laguna San Ignacio, Mexico, a
   part of the Biosphere Reserve `El Vizcaino'. Besides previously
   described Si and S3 calls, two additional calls were identified: the
   impulsive S8 call and the slightly frequency-modulated S9 call. These
   two additional S8 and S9 calls are by far the most common grey whale
   sounds detected on tags, even though contemporary bottom-mounted
   acoustic recordings also collected from the lagoon in 2008 yielded no S8
   or S9 calls. The new S8 and old S3 calls display similar spectral
   maxima, even though the S3 is a frequency-modulated harmonic call and
   the S8 is a broadband impulsive call. This spectral analysis provides
   evidence that these new call types are not artefacts arising from
   mechanical vibration or flow noise.},

Abstract = {Aim Multiple geological and climatic events have created geographical or
   ecological barriers associated with speciation events, playing a role in
   biological diversification in Mexico. Here, we evaluate the influence of
   Neogene geological events and of Pleistocene climate change in the
   diversification of the genus Gerrhonotus using molecular dating and
   ancestral area reconstruction.
   Location Mexico and south-central United States.
   Methods A multilocus sequence dataset was generated for 86 individuals
   of Gerrhonotus from most Mexican biogeographical provinces and belonging
   to five of the seven currently recognized species, as well as two
   putative undescribed species. Phylogeographical structure was explored
   using Poisson-Tree-Processes molecular species delimitation. Divergence
   events were estimated based on the fossil record using a relaxed
   uncorrelated lognormal clock. Ancestral areas were estimated at
   divergence events across the tree using a probabilistic Bayesian
   approach.
   Results Extensive geographical structure was evident within three
   well-supported clades. These clades probably diverged from each other in
   the early to mid-Miocene, and their divergence was followed by six
   divergences in the late Miocene and eight divergences in the Pliocene.
   The ancestral origin of Gerrhonotus with keeled dorsal scales
   (keeled-scale Gerrhonotus) was reconstructed to be across the Pacific
   Coast Province. Our phylogenetic analyses did not support the monophyly
   of Gerrhonotus.
   Main conclusions Miocene and Pliocene geomorphology, perhaps in
   conjunction with climate change, appears to have induced allopatric
   divergence on a relatively small spatial scale in this genus. The late
   Miocene-Pliocene reduction in the highlands along the Tehuantepec fault
   probably created a large marine embayment that led to an early
   divergence in a clade of Gerrhonotus. Our analysis suggests uplifting of
   the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during this same time period resulted in
   additional diversification. This was followed by more recent,
   independent colonization events in the Pliocene from the Mexican Plateau
   to the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre Occidental, Tamaulipas and
   Edwards Plateau provinces. A genus Gerrhonotus with the keeled-scale
   species in addition to Coloptychon rhombifer (= G. rhombifer) is
   strongly supported. Inclusion of the smooth dorsal-scale species in the
   genus is uncertain and maintained only tentatively.},

Abstract = {A new species of hylid frog is described from the southwestern edge of
   the Mexican Plateau from the states of Morelos and Mexico through
   Michoacan and Jalisco, reaching the Sierra Madre Occidental in Sinaloa
   and western Durango. The new species is part of the widespread Mexican
   hylid Sarcohyla bistincta (sensu amplo) complex, comprised of S.
   bistincta, S. pentheter, S. calthula, and S. ephemera. One subspecies of
   S. bistincta (labeculata) was proposed for an isolated population in
   Oaxaca. We restrict the group's nominal species, S. bistincta (sensu
   stricto), to the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico and southward into the
   Sierra Madre del Sur of Guerrero and Oaxaca. Examination of type
   material places S. calthula and S. ephemera in the synonymy of S.
   labeculata (new combination). The species allied to S. bistincta,
   namely, S. bistincta, S. labeculata, S. pentheter, and the new species
   described herein, are diagnosed and described following recent suggested
   taxonomic changes and new available material.},

Title = {Structure, function and evolution of the hemerythrin-like domain
   superfamily},

Abstract = {Hemerythrin-like proteins have generally been studied for their ability
   to reversibly bind oxygen through their binuclear nonheme iron centers.
   However, in recent years, it has become increasingly evident that some
   members of the hemerythrin-like superfamily also participate in many
   other biological processes. For instance, the binuclear nonheme iron
   site of YtfE, a hemerythrin-like protein involved in the repair of iron
   centers in Escherichia coli, catalyzes the reduction of nitric oxide to
   nitrous oxide, and the human F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5, which contains
   a hemerythrin-like domain, is involved in intracellular iron
   homeostasis. Furthermore, structural data on hemerythrin-like domains
   from two proteins of unknown function, PF0695 from Pyrococcus furiosus
   and NMB1532 from Neisseria meningitidis, show that the cation-binding
   sites, typical of hemerythrin, can be absent or be occupied by metal
   ions other than iron. To systematically investigate this functional and
   structural diversity of the hemerythrin-like superfamily, we have
   collected hemerythrin-like sequences from a database comprising fully
   sequenced proteomes and generated a cluster map based on their
   all-against-all pairwise sequence similarity. Our results show that the
   hemerythrin-like superfamily comprises a large number of protein
   families which can be classified into three broad groups on the basis of
   their cation-coordinating residues: (a) signal-transduction and
   oxygen-carrier hemerythrins (H-HxxxE-HxxxH-HxxxxD); (b) hemerythrin-like
   (H-HxxxE-H-HxxxE); and, (c) metazoan F-box proteins (H-HExxE-H-HxxxE).
   Interestingly, all but two hemerythrin-like families exhibit internal
   sequence and structural symmetry, suggesting that a duplication event
   may have led to the origin of the hemerythrin domain.},

Abstract = {We report on a new, environment-friendly synthesis route to produce
   Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) from extracts of the plants Vanilla
   planifolia and Cinnamomun verum. These aqueous plant extracts have the
   double function of reducing agents due to their phenolic groups, and
   also capping materials through the -OH bonding over the MNPs surface.
   The resulting MNPs have average sizes approximate to 10-14 nm with a
   core-shell Fe3O4-gamma Fe2O3 structure due to surface oxidation driven
   by the phenolic groups through OH-covalent bonding. Saturation
   magnetization values of M-s = 70.84 emu g(-1) (C. verum) and M-s = 59.45
   emu g(-1) (V. planifolia) are among the largest reported so far from
   biosynthetic samples. Electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy data
   showed a thin organic layer coating the Fe3O4 @gamma Fe2O3 MNPs,
   composed by the phenolic groups from the starting extracts of both C.
   verum and V. planifolia. A proof of concept for these MNPs as heating
   agents in magnetic hyperthermia experiments (570 kHz, 23.9 kA m(-1)) was
   performed in-vitro, showing their efficacy to induce cell death on BV2
   microglial cells after 30 min at a target temperature T = 46 degrees C.},

   compact, but not strongly compact, closing in this way an open question
   on the topology of finite dimensional asymmetric normed spaces. In the

Abstract = {Lacustrine sequences in active volcanic settings preserve the record of
   fall-out products (tephras) from explosive volcanic activity from both
   proximal and distal sources. Sediments of Lake Chalco, located in the
   western part of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt, offer the opportunity
   to develop a detailed tephrostratigraphy of proximal and distal sources,
   and to provide stratigraphic marker horizons for the correlation of
   paleoclimate records. Here, we present major oxide glass and pumice data
   from 18 tephra layers interbedded in the lacustrine sediments of Chalco,
   from 11.5 to 31.3 cal ka BP. Tephra glass compositions range from
   basaltic trachyandesitic to rhyolitic. Two tephras were successfully
   correlated with the Tutti Frutti Plinian Eruption of Popocateped
   volcano; and two tephra layers from the Nevado de Toluca Plinian
   activity: the Upper Toluca Pumice and the Lower Toluca Pumice. Although
   the source of most of the tephras analyzed is unknown, their geochemical
   characterization, coupled with a robust chronology, contributes to
   establish a detailed tephrostratigraphy for the region. This tephra
   record also contributes to improving the estimated frequency of
   explosive volcanic activity for future hazards in the Basin of Mexico
   and surrounding areas, where more than 29 million people live. Our
   findings estimate a recurrence interval of volcanic activity of ca. 1100
   years in the interval between ca. 32 and 11.5 cal ka BP, shorter than
   previously estimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Compared with the large corpus of published work devoted to the study of
   the origin and early development of anabolism, little attention has been
   given to the discussion of the early evolution of catabolism in spite of
   its significance. In the present study, we have used comparative
   genomics to explore the evolution and phylogenetic distribution of the
   enzymes that catalyze the extant catabolic pathways of the
   monosaccharides glucose and ribose, as well as those of the nucleobases
   adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. Based on the oxygen
   dependence of the enzymes, their conservation, and evolution, we
   speculate on the relative antiquity of the pathways. Our results allow
   us to suggest which catabolic pathways and enzymes may have already been
   present in the last common ancestor. We conclude that the enzymatic
   degradations of ribose, as well as those of purines adenine and guanine,
   are among the most ancient catabolic pathways which can be traced by
   protein-based methodologies.},

Abstract = {Non-Timber Forest Products like palm fruits are fundamental in the
   livelihood of Amerindian groups. For the last 10years the fruits of wild
   palm species, like Euterpe precatoria and Mauritia flexuosa, have been
   entering into global markets. These species are mostly harvested felling
   the adults, a practice that may have a disproportionate impact in the
   conservation of the populations. We studied the demography of
   E.precatoria and M.flexuosa, two important palms of the Amazon, using
   integral projection models, to characterize the population dynamics and
   project impact of different fruit harvest methods: adult felling and
   direct fruit harvest. We followed over 1400 individuals from populations
   with low harvest intensities in the Tikuna community of Amacayacu,
   Amazonas, Colombia from 2011 to 2013, establishing four plots for
   E.precatoria in seasonally inundated forests and two for M.flexuosa in
   swamps. The population growth in E.precatoria was slightly declining,
   whereas M.flexuosa was stable. As expected, the simulations of adult
   felling diminished and the number of available adults under any scenario
   for either species. On the contrary, the simulations support existing
   information that climbing and other non-destructive harvest methods
   would probably allow a sustainable management, satisfying the demand and
   preserving wild populations.

   los ultimos diez anos, los frutos de especies silvestres, como Euterpe
   precatoria y Mauritia flexuosa, han ingresado a la economia de mercado.
   Estas especies, en su mayoria, se cosechan talando los adultos, una
   practica que tiene un impacto desproporcionado en la conservacion de sus
   poblaciones. Estudiamos la demografia de E.precatoria y de M.flexuosa,
   en el Amazonas, usando modelos de proyeccion integral, para caracterizar
   su dinamica poblacional y proyectar el impacto de la cosecha de frutos
   mediante diferentes metodos: la tala de adultos y la cosecha directa de
   los frutos. Seguimos mas de 1400 individuos en poblaciones con baja
   cosecha en la comunidad Tikuna de Amacayacu, Amazonas, Colombia desde el
   2011 al 2013, estableciendo cuatro parcelas para E.precatoria en bosques
   estacionalmente inundables y dos para M.flexuosa en pantanos. El
   crecimiento poblacional de E.precatoria represento un declive, mientras
   que M.flexuosa fue estable. Segun lo esperado, en las simulaciones, la
   cosecha de los adultos disminuyo y el numero de adultos en todos los
   escenarios para las dos especies. Por otro lado, los escenarios de
   cosecha empleando la escalada, apoyan la informacion existente en la que
   la escalada y otros metodos no-destructivos podrian permitir un uso
   sostenible, satisfaciendo la demanda y tambien preservando las
   poblaciones.},

Abstract = {The five-membered heterocyclic imidazole group, which is an essential
   component of purines, histidine and many cofactors, has been abiotically
   synthesized in different model experiments that attempt to simulate the
   prebiotic environment. The evolutionary significance of imidazoles is
   highlighted not only by its presence in nucleic acid components and in
   histidine, but also by experimental reports of its ability to restore
   the catalytic activity of ribozymes. However, as of today there are no
   reports of histidine in carbonaceous chondrites, and although the
   abiotic synthesis of His reported by Shen et al. (1987, 1990a) proceeds
   via an Amadori rearrangement, like in the biosynthesis of histidine,
   neither the reactants nor the conditions are truly prebiotic. Based on
   the autocatalytic biosynthesis of 4-methylidene-imidazole-one (MIO), a
   cofactor of some members of the amino acid aromatic ammonia-lyases and
   aminomutases, which occur via the self-condensation of a simple
   Ala-Ser-Gly motif within the sequence of the enzymes, we propose a
   possible prebiotic synthesis of an imidazolide.},

Title = {Modeling soil bulk density through a complete data scanning procedure:
   Heuristic alternatives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {549},
Pages = {592-602},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soil bulk density (BD) is very important factor in land drainage and
   reclamation, irrigation scheduling (for estimating the soil volumetric
   water content), and assessing soil carbon and nutrient stock as well as
   determining the pollutant mass balance in soils. Numerous pedotransfer
   functions have been suggested so far to relate the soil BD values to
   soil parameters (e.g. soil separates, carbon content, etc). The present
   paper aims at simulating soil BD using easily measured soil variables
   through heuristic gene expression programming (GEP), neural networks
   (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted
   regression trees (BT) techniques. The statistical Gamma test was
   utilized to identify the most influential soil parameters on BD. The
   applied models were assessed through k-fold testing where all the
   available data patterns were involved in the both training and testing
   stages, which provide an accurate assessment of the models accuracy.
   Some existing pedotransfer functions were also applied and compared with
   the heuristic models. The obtained results revealed that the heuristic
   GEP model outperformed the other applied models globally and per test
   stage. Nevertheless, the performance accuracy of the applied heuristic
   models was much better than those of the applied pedotransfer functions.
   Using k-fold testing provides a more-in-detail judgment of the models.

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge about soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) is very
   important in land drainage and reclamation, groundwater pollution
   studies and modeling chemical characteristics of the agricultural lands.
   The present study aims at developing heuristic models, e.g. gene
   expression programming (GEP), neuro-fuzzy (NF), neural network (NN), and
   support vector machine (SVM) for modeling soil CEC using soil
   parameters. Soil characteristic data including soil physical parameters
   (e.g. silt, clay and sand content), organic carbon, and pH from two
   different sites in Iran were utilized to feed the applied heuristic
   models. The models were assessed through a k-fold test data set scanning
   procedures, so a complete scan of the possible train and test patterns
   was carried out at each site. Comparison of the models showed that the
   NF outperforms the other applied models in both studied sites. The
   obtained results revealed that the performance of the applied models
   fluctuated throughout the test stages and between two sites, so a
   reliable assessment of the model should consider a complete scan of the
   utilized data set, which will,be a good option for preventing partially
   valid conclusions obtained from assessing the models based on a simple
   data set assignment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A typical approach for searching periodic orbits of planar dynamical

   means, in the whole bifurcation process the eigenvalues of the linear
   approximation around the equilibrium points remain as pure imaginary.
   Similar models with a nongeneralist predator always possess a Hopf
   bifurcation.},

Abstract = {Recent studies based on niche modeling to estimate the distribution of
   species have provided evidence that the abundance of a species decreases
   as the distance to the centroid of the climatic niche of the species
   increases. This empirical relationship is determined using correlative
   models that relate the presence/absence of a species with abiotic
   factors under the assumption that species are in equilibrium with its
   environment, but without taking into account population processes
   explicitly. The lack of a mechanism that explicitly relates population
   processes to the niche hinders to interpret results and obtain general
   conclusions. In this paper the relationship between habitat suitability
   and abundance under different dispersal scenarios is explored using a
   virtual species. A clear correlation between abundance and habitat
   suitability in scenarios without dispersal was found, on the other hand,
   this correlation decreased as the proportion of individuals who are
   dispersed increases. These results support the idea that there is a
   relationship between habitat suitability and abundances, however, they
   also show that this relationship is modulated by dispersal. All Rights

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {We investigate the effect of a strong magnetic field on a three
   dimensional smectic A liquid crystal. We identify a critical field above
   which the uniform layered state loses stability; this is associated to
   the onset of layer undulations. In a previous work Garcia-Cervera and
   Joo (2012 Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 203 1-43), Garcia-Cervera and Joo
   considered the two dimensional case and analyzed the transition to the
   undulated state via a simple bifurcation. In dimension n = 3 the
   situation is more delicate because the first eigenvalue of the
   corresponding linearized problem is not simple. We overcome the
   difficulties inherent to this higher dimensional setting by identifying
   the irreducible representations for natural actions on the functional
   that take into account the invariances of the problem thus allowing for
   reducing the bifurcation analysis to a subspace with symmetries. We are
   able to describe at least two bifurcation branches, highlighting the
   richer landscape of energy critical states in the three dimensional
   setting. Finally, we analyze a reduced two dimensional problem, assuming
   the magnetic field is very strong, and are able to relate this to a
   model in micromagnetics studied in Alouges et al (2002 ESAIM Control
   Optim. Calc. Var. 8 31-68), from where we deduce the periodicity
   property of minimizers.},

Title = {Molecular Evolution of the Oxygen-Binding Hemerythrin Domain},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Background
   The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis during Precambrian times
   entailed the diversification of strategies minimizing reactive oxygen
   species-associated damage. Four families of oxygen-carrier proteins
   (hemoglobin, hemerythrin and the two non-homologous families of
   arthropodan and molluscan hemocyanins) are known to have evolved
   independently the capacity to bind oxygen reversibly, providing cells
   with strategies to cope with the evolutionary pressure of oxygen
   accumulation. Oxygen-binding hemerythrin was first studied in marine
   invertebrates but further research has made it clear that it is present
   in the three domains of life, strongly suggesting that its origin
   predated the emergence of eukaryotes.
   Results
   Oxygen-binding hemerythrins are a monophyletic sub-group of the
   hemerythrin/HHE (histidine, histidine, glutamic acid) cation-binding
   domain. Oxygen-binding hemerythrin homologs were unambiguously
   identified in 367/2236 bacterial, 21/150 archaeal and 4/135 eukaryotic
   genomes. Overall, oxygen-binding hemerythrin homologues were found in
   the same proportion as single-domain and as long protein sequences. The
   associated functions of protein domains in long hemerythrin sequences
   can be classified in three major groups: signal transduction,
   phosphorelay response regulation, and protein binding. This suggests
   that in many organisms the reversible oxygen-binding capacity was
   incorporated in signaling pathways. A maximum-likelihood tree of
   oxygen-binding hemerythrin homologues revealed a complex evolutionary
   history in which lateral gene transfer, duplications and gene losses
   appear to have played an important role.
   Conclusions
   Hemerythrin is an ancient protein domain with a complex evolutionary
   history. The distinctive iron-binding coordination site of
   oxygen-binding hemerythrins evolved first in prokaryotes, very likely
   prior to the divergence of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and spread
   into many bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic species. The later
   evolution of the oxygen-binding hemerythrin domain in both prokaryotes
   and eukaryotes led to a wide variety of functions, ranging from
   protection against oxidative damage in anaerobic and microaerophilic
   organisms, to oxygen supplying to particular enzymes and pathways in
   aerobic and facultative species.},

Abstract = {Let us denote by K-n the hyperspace of all convex bodies of R-n equipped
   with the Hausdorff distance topology. An affine invariant point p is a
   continuous and Aff(n)-equivariant map p : K-n -> R-n, where Aff(n)
   denotes the group of all nonsingular affine maps of Rn. For every K is
   an element of K-n, let B-n (K) = \{p(K) is an element of R-n vertical
   bar p is an affine invariant point\} and F-n(K) = \{x is an element of
   R-n vertical bar gx = x for every g is an element of Aff(n) such that gK
   = K\}. In 1963, B. Grunbaum conjectured that B-n (K) = F-n(K) {[}3].
   After some partial results, the conjecture was recently proven in {[}6].
   In this short note we give a rather different, simpler and shorter proof
   of this conjecture, based merely on the topology of the action of Aff(n)

Abstract = {The extinct family Albanerpetontidae is the only family included within
   Allocaudata so far known to date. This family lies within the clade
   Lissamphibia along with Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona, which spans from
   the Triassic period to the present.
   This family includes the single North American genus, Albanerpeton,
   which is recorded from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian/earliest Albian) to
   the Pliocene epochs. Since 2004, paleontological expeditions have been
   performed in the El Gallo formation (Campanian, Late Cretaceous) in Baja
   California, Mexico. The results of such field work have resulted in the
   discovery of several new sites yielding microvertebrates. In one of the
   ROS51 site, fragments belonging to the family Albanerpetontidae were
   recovered, which includes remains of a dentary and a premaxilla with
   teeth. The morphological characters that allow their identification as
   belonging to the family are: pleurodont and non-pedicelate closely
   spaced robust teeth, closely spaced. This represents the first record of
   this family in Mexico, and being the southernmost occurrence and the
   first one collected on the Pacific coast of North America.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparison between genomic medicine and forensic
   genetics in Mexico, in light of recent depictions of the nation as a
   pais de gordos' (country of the fat) and a pais de muertos' (country of
   the dead). We examine the continuities and ruptures in the public image
   of genetics in these two areas of attention, health and security,
   focusing especially on how the relevant publics of genetic science are
   assembled in each case. Publics of biomedical and forensic genetics are
   assembled through processes of recruitment and interpellation, in ways
   that modulate current theorizations of co-production. The comparison
   also provides a vista onto discussions regarding the involvement of
   genetics in regimes of governance and citizenship and about the
   relationship between the state and biopower in a context of perceived
   health crisis and war-like violence.},

Title = {Structural Analysis of Monomeric RNA-Dependent Polymerases: Evolutionary
   and Therapeutic Implications},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The crystal structures of monomeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and
   reverse transcriptases of more than 20 different viruses are available
   in the Protein Data Bank. They all share the characteristic right-hand
   shape of DNA- and RNA polymerases formed by the fingers, palm and thumb
   subdomains, and, in many cases, ``fingertips{''} that extend from the
   fingers towards the thumb subdomain, giving the viral enzyme a closed
   right-hand appearance. Six conserved structural motifs that contain key
   residues for the proper functioning of the enzyme have been identified
   in all these RNA-dependent polymerases. These enzymes share a two
   divalent metal-ion mechanism of polymerization in which two conserved
   aspartate residues coordinate the interactions with the metal ions to
   catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The recent availability of
   crystal structures of polymerases of the Orthomyxoviridae and
   Bunyaviridae families allowed us to make pairwise comparisons of the
   tertiary structures of polymerases belonging to the four main RNA viral
   groups, which has led to a phylogenetic tree in which single-stranded
   negative RNA viral polymerases have been included for the first time.
   This has also allowed us to use a homology-based structural prediction
   approach to develop a general three-dimensional model of the Ebola virus
   RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Our model includes several of the
   conserved structural motifs and residues described in other viral
   RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that define the catalytic and highly
   conserved palm subdomain, as well as portions of the fingers and thumb
   subdomains. The results presented here help to understand the current
   use and apparent success of antivirals, i.e. Brincidofovir, Lamivudine
   and Favipiravir, originally aimed at other types of polymerases, to
   counteract the Ebola virus infection.},

Title = {Long forsaken species diversity in the Middle American lizard
   Holcosus undulatus (Teiidae)},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {175},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Numerous reptile species have been divided into subspecies. Although
   this classification may capture the morphological variation within
   species, it often conceals significant species diversity because many
   subspecies actually represent species under lineage-based species
   concepts. The lizard Holcosus undulatus is a common, widely distributed,
   monotypic species in Middle America. However, 12 subspecies of this
   taxon were recognized until the early 1970s. We used two lineage-based
   methods for species delimitation to re-evaluate species limits within
   H.undulatus with DNA sequence and morphological data. We included all
   the previously recognized subspecies of H.undulatus except H.u. miadis.
   Holcosus undulatus was exclusive. In addition, H.u. amphigrammus, H.u.
   gaigeae, H.u. hartwegi, H.u. parvus, H.u. pulcher, H.u. sinister, H.u.
   stuarti, H.u. thomasi and H.u. undulatus were supported as distinct
   evolutionary lineages based on the molecular and morphological evidence.
   We therefore elevate all of these subspecies to species rank. In
   addition, two separate mitochondrial lineages may represent cryptic,
   undescribed species within H.undulatus. The morphological distinctness
   and allopatry of H.u. miadis and H.u. pulcher, as well as the high
   genetic divergence of the latter species, suggest that they also
   represent distinct evolutionary species. Our results also suggest that
   additional species diversity may still be hidden within the H.u.
   amphigrammus, H.u. parvus, H.u. sinister and H.u. undulatus lineages.
   This work supports resurrection of overlooked diversity within Holcosus,
   which has important implications for the conservation of this genus in
   Middle America.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the `'long 1970s'' ( 1969-1983) is an important
   though often overlooked period in the development of a rich landscape in
   the research of metabolism, development, and evolution. The period is
   marked by: shrinking public funding of basic science, shifting research
   agendas in molecular biology, the incorporation of new phenomena and
   experimental tools from previous biological research at the molecular
   level, and the development of recombinant DNA techniques. Research was
   reoriented towards eukaryotic cells and development, and in particular
   towards `'giant'' RNA processing and transcription. We will here focus
   on three different models of developmental regulation published in that
   period: the two models of eukaryotic genetic regulation at the
   transcriptional level that were developed by Georgii P. Georgiev on the
   one hand, and by Roy Britten and Eric Davidson on the other; and the
   model of genetic sufficiency and evolution of regulatory genes proposed
   by Emile Zuckerkandl. These three cases illustrate the range of
   exploratory hypotheses that characterised the challenging landscape of
   gene regulation in the 1970s, a period that in hindsight can be labelled
   as transitional, between the biology at the laboratory bench of the
   preceding period, and the biology of genetic engineering and intensive
   data-driven research that followed.},

Title = {Stem tilting in the inter-tropical cactus Echinocactus
   platyacanthus: an adaptive solution to the trade-off between

Abstract = {While plants require radiation for photosynthesis, radiation in warm
   deserts can have detrimental effects from high temperatures. This
   dilemma may be solved through plant morphological attributes. In cold
   deserts, stem tilting keeps reproductive organs warm by increasing
   radiation interception at the cost of decreased annual light
   interception. Conversely, little is known about stem tilting in warm
   deserts. We hypothesised that stem tilting in Echinocactus platyacanthus
   prevents high temperatures near the apex, where reproduction occurs. The
   study was conducted in the warm, inter-tropical portion of the
   Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. We found that cacti preferentially tilted
   towards the south, which reduced temperatures of reproductive organs
   during the hot season, but increased total annual near-apex PAR
   interception. Tilting also maximised reproduction, a likely consequence
   of temperature control but perhaps also of the difficulty in
   translocating photosynthates in cacti; therefore, annual energy
   acquisition near floral meristems may be largely allocated to
   reproduction. Unlike plants of higher latitudes, in inter-tropical
   deserts sunlight at noon comes either from the north or the south,
   depending on the season, and thus stem tilting may more strongly affect
   total annual radiation received in different portions of the stem.
   Inter-tropical cacti can synchronise reproduction with irradiance peaks
   if flowering occurs in a specific (north or south) portion of the stem;
   also, they effectively solve the conflict between maximising annual PAR
   interception and minimising temperature at the hottest time of day.
   Notably, the two inter-tropical cacti in which stem tilting has been
   studied successfully solve this conflict.},

Abstract = {The absence of the hydrophobic norvaline and norleucine in the inventory
   of protein amino acids is readdressed. The well-documented intracellular
   accumulation of these two amino acids results from the low-substrate
   specificity of the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic enzymes that
   act over a number of related alpha-ketoacids. The lack of absolute
   substrate specificity of leucyl-tRNA synthase leads to a mischarged
   norvalyl-tRNA(Leu) that evades the translational proofreading activites
   and produces norvaline-containing proteins, (cf. Apostol et al. J Biol
   Chem 272:28980-28988, 1997). A similar situation explains the presence
   of minute but detectable amounts of norleucine in place of methionine.
   Since with few exceptions both leucine and methionine are rarely found
   in the catalytic sites of most enzymes, their substitution by norvaline
   and norleucine, respectively, would have not been strongly hindered in
   small structurally simple catalytic polypeptides during the early stages
   of biological evolution. The report that down-shifts of free oxygen lead
   to high levels of intracellular accumulation of pyruvate and the
   subsequent biosynthesis of norvaline (Soini et al. Microb Cell Factories
   7:30, 2008) demonstrates the biochemical and metabolic consequences of
   the development of a highly oxidizing environment. The results discussed
   here also suggest that a broader definition of biomarkers in the search
   for extraterrestrial life may be required.},

Abstract = {In this work, the transient two-dimensional conjugated
   (conduction-natural convection) heating of a fluid in a rectangular
   large aspect ratio cavity (height to length ratio = 12) is studied, with
   solid conductive walls of finite thickness. The equations of motion,
   written in nondimensional form, depending on five nondimensional
   parameters (the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, the ratio of the thermal
   conductivities and diffusivities of the fluid, the material of the
   cavity, and the nondimensional width of the walls), are solved
   numerically by the use of the SIMPLE algorithm. Three different heat
   transfer regimes were detected. The first one is the diffusive and
   quasi-diffusive, where heat is rapidly transferred along the cavity
   walls and then transmitted to the fluid from the internal boundary of
   the cavity, being almost independent on the Rayleigh number with a
   symmetrical response of the temperature and velocity fields. The second
   is diffusive-convective, where convection plays a more important role
   than in the previous case, symmetry is no longer preserved and different
   mechanisms of symmetry breakdown are present. The third one is the
   convective regime, where heat conduction along the walls is negligible
   and they can be assumed to be perfect insulators. Finally, it was found
   that the presence of conductive walls helps to stabilize and speed up
   the heating process, changing not only the magnitude of the heat flux to
   the system, but the physical response of the fluid inside the cavity.},

Abstract = {The results of a detailed bioinformatic search for ribonucleotidyl
   coenzyme biosynthetic sequences in DNA- and RNA viral genomes are
   presented. No RNA viral genome sequence available as of April 2011
   appears to encode for sequences involved in coenzyme biosynthesis. In
   both single- and double-stranded DNA viruses a diverse array of coenzyme
   biosynthetic genes has been identified, but none of the viral genomes
   examined here encodes for a complete pathway. Although our conclusions
   may be constrained by the unexplored diversity of viral genomes and the
   biases in the construction of viral genome databases, our results do not
   support the possibility that RNA viruses are direct holdovers from an
   ancient RNA/protein world. Extrapolation of our results to evolutionary
   epochs prior to the emergence of DNA genomes suggest that during those
   early stages living entities may have depended on discontinuous genetic
   systems consisting of multiple small-size RNA sequences. (c) 2012

Abstract = {The history of the ideas that led to the RNA World hypothesis is
   reviewed. As the understanding of the properties of RNA molecules
   progressed, the evolutionary interpretation of their genetic properties
   and widespread distribution in intracellular environments, as well as
   the catalytic properties of nucleotide coenzymes and the participation
   of RNA monomers in metabolic pathways, led to several independent
   proposals of protein-free primordial life forms. Current ideas on the
   RNA World are part of a long and storied scientific perspective in which
   these different hypotheses were developed. However, the lack of
   continuity between them may be explained in part by the absence of an
   evolutionary framework that characterized the early development of
   molecular biology, as well as by the demise of certain areas of research
   like coenzyme chemistry.},

Abstract = {A general spin system with a nonaxially symmetric Hamiltonian containing
   J(x), J(z)-linear and J(z)-quadratic terms, widely used in many-body
   fermionic and bosonic systems and in molecular magnetism, is considered
   for the variations of general parameters describing intensity
   interaction changes of each of its terms. For this model Hamiltonian, a
   semiclassical energy surface (ES) is obtained by means of the
   coherent-state formalism. An analysis of this ES function, based on
   catastrophe theory, determines the separatrix in the control parameter
   space of the system Hamiltonian: the loci of singularities representing
   semiclassical phase transitions. Here we show that distinct regions of
   qualitatively different spectrum structures, as well as a singular
   behavior of quantum states, are ruled by this separatrix: here we show
   that the separatrix not only describes ground-state singularities, which
   have been associated with quantum phase transitions, but also reveals
   the structure of the excited spectrum, distinguishing different quantum
   phases within the parameter space. Finally, we consider magnetic
   susceptibility and heat capacity of the system at finite temperature, in
   order to study thermal properties and thermodynamical phase transitions
   in the perspective of the separatrix of this Hamiltonian system.},

Abstract = {Four medicinal plants-Tecoma stans, Ligusticum porteri, Monarda
   austromontana, and Poliomintha longiflora, which are distributed in
   tropical and subtropical countries of the American continent-are widely
   used in folk medicine to treat diseases such as diarrhea and dysentery.
   In addition, T. stans and P. longiflora are extensively used as
   hypoglycemic agents, and M. austromontana and P. longiflora are used as
   condiments. The plants were collected, identified, dried, and
   pulverized. Solvent extraction was prepared by maceration of the plant
   samples, and the phytochemical composition of the extracts was
   determined by using standard analysis procedures. Phytochemical analysis
   showed the presence of triterpenoids/steroids, flavonoids, and
   phenols/tannins and, in L. porteri, traces of alkaloids. After the
   elimination of solvents in vacuo, the extracts were administrated to
   Drosophila larvae to test their toxicity and genotoxicity. Third instar
   larvae were chronically fed with the phytoextracts. The extract from L.
   porteri was toxic, whereas those from T. stans, P. longiflora, and M.
   austromontana were not. Genotoxic activities of the 4 plants were
   investigated by using the wing-spot assay of D. melanogaster. Mitomycin
   C was used as a positive control. No statistically significant increase
   was observed between treated sample series and a concurrent negative
   (water) or solvent control sample series.},
