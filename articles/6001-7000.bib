Abstract = {Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) is a neuropeptide that is
   synthesized, stored, and released by brain and eyestalk structures in
   decapods. CHH participates in the regulation of several mechanisms,
   including increasing the level of glucose in hemolymph. Although CHH
   mRNA levels have been quantified and the CHH protein has been localized
   in various structures of the crayfish P. clarkii, CHH synthesis has only
   been reported in the X-organ-sinus gland (XO-SG). Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to use in situ hybridization to determine whether CHH
   mRNA is located in other structures, including the putative pacemaker,
   eyestalk and brain, of crayfish P. clarkii at two times of day. CHH mRNA
   was observed in both the eyestalk and the brain of P. clarkii,
   indicating that CHH is synthesized in several structures in common with
   other crustaceans, possibly to provide metabolic support for these
   regions by increasing glucose levels.},

Title = {Spinorial representation of submanifolds in metric Lie groups},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {348-374},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper we give a spinorial representation of submanifolds of any
   dimension and codimension into Lie groups equipped with left invariant
   metrics. As applications, we get a spinorial proof of the Fundamental
   Theorem for submanifolds into Lie groups, we recover previously known
   representations of submanifolds in R-n and in the 3-dimensional Lie
   groups S-3 and E(kappa, tau), and we get a new spinorial representation
   for surfaces in the 3-dimensional semi-direct products: this achieves
   the spinorial representations of surfaces in the 3-dimensional
   homogeneous spaces. We finally indicate how to recover a
   Weierstrass-type representation for CMC-surfaces in 3-dimensional metric
   Lie groups recently given by Meeks, Mira, Perez and Ros. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Significance: Recently, chronic degenerative diseases have become one of
   the main health problems worldwide. That is the case of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), whose expression can be
   influenced by different risk factors.
   Recent Advances: In recent decades, it has been widely described that
   MetS increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. MetS
   pathogenesis involves several vascular risk factors such as diabetes,
   dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance (I/R).
   Critical Issues: Reported evidence shows that vascular risk factors are
   associated with AD, particularly in the development of protein
   aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and
   disturbances in signaling pathways, with insulin receptor signaling
   being a common alteration between MetS and AD.
   Future Directions: Insulin signaling has been involved in tau
   phosphorylation and amyloid beta (A beta) metabolism. However, it has
   also been demonstrated that A beta oligomers can bind to insulin
   receptors, triggering their internalization, decreasing neuron
   responsiveness to insulin, and promoting insulin I/R. Thus, it could be
   argued that A beta could be a convergent factor in the development of
   both pathologies.},

Title = {PREFERRED TEMPERATURE, CRITICAL THERMAL MAXIMUM, AND METABOLIC RESPONSE
   OF THE BLACK SEA URCHIN ARBACIA STELLATA (BLAINVILLE, 1825;
   GMELIN, 1791)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Populations of the black sea urchin Arbacia stellata present in the Gulf
   of California and outer Pacific Coast area are probably the result of
   colonization from the Panamic region. In the Pacific Coast of Baja
   California, this species experiences seasonal fluctuations of
   temperature. It was determined the preferred temperature (PT), critical
   threshold limits represented for Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax) and
   oxygen consumption rate in organisms acclimated to 16 degrees C, 19
   degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 25 degrees C in controlled conditions. The
   PT of A. stellata was determined in organisms using the acute method. As
   the acclimation temperature increases, the PT also increases
   significantly (P < 0.05) and decreases to 22.8 degrees C. In the
   acclimation temperature of 25 degrees C, PT for black sea urchins was
   23.3 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C. A direct relation was determined
   between the CTMax and acclimation temperatures being of 36.48 degrees C
   +/- 0.6 degrees C, 37.64 degrees C +/- 0.76 degrees C, 38.08 degrees C
   +/- 0.94 degrees C, 38.42 degrees C +/- 0.71 degrees C. The end point of
   CTMax was stage E4, where the sea urchins stop moving, relax the large
   spines but activity continues with light movements of small spines and
   when the organisms lose the ability to remain attached to the substrate.
   The oxygen consumption rates increased significantly (P < 0.05) from
   5.59 to 11.5 mg O-2 kg/h wet weight (w.w.) as the acclimation
   temperature increased from 16 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The range of
   temperature coefficient (Q(10)) between 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C
   (lowest) was 1.90, indicating that within that range of acclimation
   temperature, organisms are adapted to maintain homeostasis. This
   corresponded with the interval of PT of the species. These results may
   partially explain their distribution pattern in Baja California Coast.},

Title = {Pulse Propagation Models with Bands of Forbidden Frequencies or
   Forbidden Wavenumbers: A Consequence of Abandoning the Slowly Varying
   Envelope Approximation and Taking into Account Higher-Order Dispersion},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We study linear and nonlinear pulse propagation models whose linear
   dispersion relations present bands of forbidden frequencies or forbidden
   wavenumbers. These bands are due to the interplay between higher-order
   dispersion and one of the terms (a second-order derivative with respect
   to the propagation direction) which appears when we abandon the slowly
   varying envelope approximation. We show that as a consequence of these
   forbidden bands, narrow pulses radiate in a novel and peculiar way. We
   also show that the nonlinear equations studied in this paper have exact
   soliton-like solutions of different forms, some of them being embedded
   solitons. The solutions obtained (of the linear as well as the nonlinear
   equations) are interesting since several arguments suggest that the
   Cauchy problems for these equations are ill-posed, and therefore the
   specification of the initial conditions is a delicate issue. It is also
   shown that some of these equations are related to elliptic curves, thus
   suggesting that these equations might be related to other fields where
   these curves appear, such as the theory of modular forms and Weierstrass
   phi functions, or the design of cryptographic protocols.},

Abstract = {In 2003, flooding occurred in the Ciudadela (Citadel) of Teotihuacan and
   saltpeter began to damage the Temple of the Feathered Serpent. Work done
   to solve this problem led to one of the most important archaeological
   discoveries made in this site in recent years: an intact tunnel sealed
   for more than a thousand years. The project created to study the tunnel
   was named Tlalocan or Path to the Underworld. More than 60,000 objects
   have been recovered after years of exploration and removing huge amounts
   of soil and stones. This paper presents the first results of accelerator
   mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating performed on some of those
   materials recovered from the tunnel. With these findings, in combination
   with the archaeological data, based on stratigraphy and ceramic
   typology, a chronology of several events is proposed concerning the
   construction phases and ceremonial use, as well as partial and
   definitive closures of the tunnel. Every closure was accompanied by a
   deliberate and structured deposition of offerings and ritual refuse
   along the tunnel. The range of ages that covers the Bayesian calibration
   of samples collected along the tunnel is around 115 yr, from AD 125 to
   240. Material collected at the surface of the chamber located at the end
   of the tunnel and under the pyramid gave ages in the interval between AD
   400 and 534. All samples analyzed fall within the interval of time that
   covers the period of occupation of Teotihuacan.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The dispersal of diaspores is a key process for successful reproduction,
   survival and evolution of plants. To model the dispersal of biological
   propagules ( e.g., spores, pollen) it is necessary to measure their
   terminal velocity (V-t) in air. In this study, we used a new method
   based on video image analysis to measure V-t of spores of seven fern
   taxa. The average V-t of fern spores was 7.0 cms(-1), but varied among
   species from 1.6 to 11.3 cm s(-1). Similar values were reported
   previously for airborne particles of mosses and seed plants. Spores of
   Danaea nodosa and Lophosoria quadripinnata had a lower V-t than other
   spores of similar size, perhaps owing to their surface ornamentation
   that increases their drag coefficient, or an air cavity, which
   diminishes their density. The reliability of the video image analysis
   method used here on fern spores was verified by comparing observed and
   theoretically calculated V-t of glass beads of known diameter and
   density. This method also allows the observation of spore behavior
   (e.g., rotation) as they move through the air. Because the method is
   relatively easy and inexpensive, it can promote future aerobiological
   research on other biological airborne particles as well.},

Abstract = {An arc-coloring of a strongly connected digraph D is a strongly
   monochromatic-connecting coloring if for every pair u, v of vertices in
   D there exist an (u, v)-monochromatic path and a (v, u)-monochromatic
   path. Let smc(D) denote the maximum number of colors that can be used in
   a strongly monochromatic-connecting coloring of D. In this paper we
   prove that if D is a strongly connected oriented graph of size m, then
   smc(D) = m Omega(D)+ 1, where Omega(D) is the minimum size of a spanning
   strongly connected subdigraph of D. As a corollary of this result, we
   see that a strongly connected oriented graph D of order n is hamiltonian
   if and only if smc(D) = m- n + 1. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Glucose and sucrose differentially modify cell proliferation in maize
   during germination},
Journal = {PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {20-31},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Glucose and sucrose play a dual role: as carbon and energy sources and
   as signaling molecules. In order to address the impact that sugars may
   have on maize seeds during germination, embryo axes were incubated with
   or without either of the two sugars. Expression of key cell cycle
   markers and protein abundance, cell patterning and de novo DNA synthesis
   in root meristem zones were analyzed. Embryo axes without added sugars
   in imbibition medium were unable to grow after 7 days; in sucrose,
   embryo axes developed seminal and primary roots with numerous root
   hairs, whereas in glucose axes showed a twisted morphology, no root hair
   formation but callus-like structures on adventitious and primary seminal
   roots. More and smaller cells were observed with glucose treatment in
   root apical meristems. de novo DNA synthesis was stimulated more by
   glucose than by sucrose. At 24 h of imbibition, expression of ZmCycD2;2a
   and ZmCycD4;2 was increased by sucrose and reduced by glucose. CDKA1;1
   and CDICA2;1 expression was stimulated equally by both sugars. Protein
   abundance patterns were modified by sugars: ZmCycD2 showed peaks on
   glucose at 12 and 36 h of imbibition whereas sucrose promoted ZmCycD3
   protein accumulation. In presence of glucose ZmCycD3, ZmCycD4 and
   ZmCycD6 protein abundance was reduced after 24 h. Finally, both sugars
   stimulated ZmCDKA protein accumulation but at different times. Overall,
   even though glucose appears to act as a stronger mitogen stimulator,
   sucrose stimulated the expression of more cell cycle markers during
   germination. This work provides evidence of a differential response of
   cell cycle markers to sucrose and glucose during maize germination that
   may affect the developmental program during plantlet establishment. (C)

Title = {URB597 reduces biochemical, behavioral and morphological alterations in
   two neurotoxic models in rats},
Journal = {BIOMEDICINE \& PHARMACOTHERAPY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {745-753},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: URB597 is a compound largely linked to the inhibition of
   fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme responsible for the
   metabolic degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). Despite
   this pharmacological property accounts for its modulatory profile
   demonstrated in some neurotoxic paradigms, the possible protective
   properties of this agent have been poorly investigated, and deserve
   exploration in different neurotoxic models. In this study, we explored
   the effects of URB597 on oxidative damage to lipids and other major
   endpoints of toxicity in two neurotoxic models in vivo in rats (the
   first one produced by the mitochondrial neurotoxin 3-nitropropionic acid
   {[}3-NP], and the other generated by the striatal injection of the
   pro-oxidant toxin 6-hydroxidopamine {[}6-OHDA]) in order to provide
   further supporting evidence of its modulatory profile.
   Methods: Male Wistar adult rats were treated for 5 or 7 consecutive days
   with URB597 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and simultaneously exposed to three
   injections of 3-NP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or a single intrastriatal infusion
   of 6-OHDA (0.02 mg/2 mu l), respectively. Twenty four hours after all
   treatments were administered, lipid peroxidation was measured in the
   striatum of 3-NP-treated rats, and in the midbrain of 6-OHDA-treated
   rats. Motor skills and histological assessment in the striatum were also
   evaluated in 3-NP-treated rats 6 and 7 days after the last drug
   administration, respectively; whereas apomorphine-induced circling
   behavior and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolocalization in the striatum and
   substantia nigra were investigated 21 and 22 days after the last drug
   infusion, respectively.
   Results: URB597 prevented the oxidative damage to lipids induced by 3-NP
   in the striatum, and this effect could account for the attenuation of
   motor deficits in this model. Attenuation of motor disturbances induced
   by URB597 in both models was associated with the morphological
   preservation of the striatum in the 3-NP model and the partial
   preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the 6-OHDA model in the SNpc and
   striatum.
   Conclusion: The modulatory actions exerted by URB597 in both toxic
   models support its potential against toxic conditions implying motor and
   neurochemical alterations linked to energy depletion, excitotoxicity and

   constant r-th mean curvature H-r for some 2 <= r <= n-1 and two
   principal curvatures of multiplicities (n-1) and 1. We suppose further
   that vertical bar H-r vertical bar > 0 for c = 0, vertical bar H-r
   vertical bar > 1 for c = -1 and being H-r any value for c = 1. We prove
   that the infimum and the supremum of the squared norm of the second
   fundamental form of M are attained, obtain sharp bounds for them and
   characterize those hypersurfaces where the bounds is attained. (C) 2016

Title = {A two-stage variable selection and classification approach for
   Parkinson's disease detection by using voice recording replications},
Journal = {COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {147-156},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background and Objective: In the scientific literature, there is a lack
   of variable selection and classification methods considering replicated
   data. The problem motivating this work consists in the discrimination of
   people suffering Parkinson's disease from healthy subjects based on
   acoustic features automatically extracted from replicated voice
   recordings.
   Methods: A two-stage variable selection and classification approach has
   been developed to properly match the replication-based experimental
   design. The way the statistical approach has been specified allows that
   the computational problems are solved by using an easy-to-implement
   Gibbs sampling algorithm.
   Results: The proposed approach produces an acceptable predictive
   capacity for PD discrimination with the considered database, despite the
   fact that the sample size is relatively small. Specifically, the
   accuracy rate, sensitivity and specificity are 86.2\%, 82.5\%, and
   90.0\%, respectively. However, the most important fact is that there is
   an improvement in the interpretability of the results at the same time
   that it is shown a better chain mixing and a lower computation time with
   respect to the only-classification approaches presented in the
   scientific literature.
   Conclusions: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   approach developed to properly consider intra-subject variability for
   variable selection and classification. Although the proposed approach
   has been applied for PD discrimination, it can be applied in other
   contexts with similar replication-based experimental designs. (C) 2017

Abstract = {A simple method for manufacturing centimeter-long all-PDMS embedded and
   rib microwaveguides is presented. It allows for the fabrication of
   centimeter-long micromolds by direct laser ablation of a desired
   waveguide pattern inside an acrylic sheet to create a pattern which is
   then transferred to a poly-dimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) layer using
   soft-lithography. A refractive index difference between the core and
   cladding of 1.3x10(-3) was achieved by controlling the PDMS curing and
   linear attenuation of 1.27 dB/cm for embedded and 2.36 dB/cm for a rib
   waveguide, similar to other techniques. Finally, a beamsplitter was
   fabricated to demonstrate that our low-cost process is suitable to
   integrate waveguide devices on lab on chip platforms. (C) 2017 Optical

Abstract = {Air pollution in Mexico City, which has more than 22 million
   inhabitants, continues to be one of the main environmental issues.
   Aerosol samples (PM10) collected in Mexico City and the city of
   Cuernavaca (a clean reference site) have been characterized using
   different techniques. This multifaceted approach addresses the source
   apportionment of the carbonaceous matter in PM10, as well as the
   airborne elements and ions. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)
   radiocarbon analysis of total carbon, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and ion
   chromatography were performed on aerosols collected at three sites in
   Mexico City and one site in Cuernavaca, during 2 months of the cold-dry
   season (November-December) in 2012. New results obtained for Mexico City
   are compared with previous reports. Average levels of PM10 were higher
   in Mexico City sites (43.3-60.8 mu g/ m(3)) than in Cuernavaca (32.2 mu
   g/ m(3)). According to the material balance, PM10 collected in Mexico
   City had a lower contribution of crustal material (31.2-36.8\%) than
   Cuernavaca (46.9\%). Average contributions of particulate carbonaceous
   matter to PM10 were similar in both cities, but much higher
   contributions of mineral salts, trace elements, and ions were observed
   in Mexico City in comparison to Cuernavaca. Total organic carbon (OC)
   and elemental carbon (EC) contents were higher in aerosols from Mexico
   City than those from Cuernavaca. The temporal variation results showed
   that within all locations studied the OC concentration was high compared
   to the EC. Results from a theoretical calculation of fossil carbon (FC)
   and biogenic carbon (BC) concentrations showed that FC and BC levels
   depend on the site: at Mexico City sites, FC was equal or higher than
   BC. At Cuernavaca, BC was always higher than FC.},

Title = {Wild Vanilla planifolia and its relatives in the Mexican Yucatan

Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Vanilla planifolia, a threatened species, is distributed
   naturally in semi-deciduous and evergreen rain forests of southeastern
   Mexico and parts of Central America. In the wild, it is difficult to
   diagnose from another sympatric Vanilla species, and individuals with
   reproductive structures are usually required.
   Questions: Can ISSR discriminate wild individuals of Vanilla planifolia
   from other sympatric species of the genus? Can phylogenetic analyses of
   ITS recover the monophyly of V. planifolia and help identify Vanilla
   species?
   Studied species: The vanilla V. planifolia), the second-most important
   economically spice in the world.
   Methods: We analyzed 88 wild individuals of several Vanilla species.
   Individuals of five species of Vanilla reported for the region were used
   as reference. 84 ISSR loci were analyzed using three clustering methods.
   A phylogenetic inference using ITS was performed.
   Results: ISSR markers clearly discriminate wild Vanilla planifolia,
   finding definite genetic structure within the species. The three
   clustering methods identified genetic relationships with congruent
   patterns. Five groups were found and they corresponded with the species
   studied. Phylogenetic inference of ITS sequences supported the monophyly
   of the Vanilla and the resulting cladograms were coherent with the
   clustering pattern observed in the ISSR studies.
   Conclusions: Both ISSR and ITS analyses are able to identify V.
   planifolia. Molecular data suggest the presence of V. pompona and a new
   species of Vanilla in the Yucatan Peninsula.},

Volume = {131},

Abstract = {Although epibiosis is common in polyplacophorans, we describe an unusual
   presence of epibionts and endobionts in a single adult specimen of
   Chiton articulatus collected in Guerrero, Mexico, from an eroded habitat
   of crevices with high wave activity. The epibiont and endobiont
   specimens covered nearly 90\% of the central and lateral areas of the
   chiton valves while the border of mantle girdle showed no epibiosis.
   Crustose and filamentous algae, and crustacean arthropods from two
   common barnacle families, Chthamalidae and Balanidae, represent the
   observed epibionts. Polychaete (Annelida), bivalve mollusks from two
   families: Pteriidae (Pinctada mazatlanica) and Mytilidae (Leiosolenus
   aristatus), and crustacean arthropods from the burrowing barnacle family
   Cryptophialidae (Cryptophialus wainwrighti) represent the observed
   endobionts. In addition, finding of Cryptophialus wainwrighti represents
   a new geographic range extension from the type locality in Sinaloa to
   Guerrero. Epibiosis studies of invertebrates in the intertidal rocky
   shore, such as the dominant C. articulatus, can assist in understanding
   ecological relationships and patterns of diversity in coastal
   communities.},

Title = {Effective loop quantum geometry of Schwarzschild interior},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {The success of loop quantum cosmology to resolve classical singularities
   of homogeneous models has led to its application to the classical
   Schwarszchild black hole interior, which takes the form of a homogeneous
   Kantowski-Sachs model. The first steps of this were done in pure quantum
   mechanical terms, hinting at the traversable character of the would-be
   classical singularity, and then others were performed using effective
   heuristic models capturing quantum effects that allowed a geometrical
   description closer to the classical one but avoided its singularity.
   However, the problem of establishing the link between the quantum and
   effective descriptions was left open. In this work, we propose to fill
   in this gap by considering the path-integral approach to the loop
   quantization of the Kantowski-Sachs model corresponding to the
   Schwarzschild black hole interior. We show that the transition amplitude
   can be expressed as a path integration over the imaginary exponential of
   an effective action which just coincides, under some simplifying
   assumptions, with the heuristic one. Additionally, we further explore
   the consequences of the effective dynamics. We prove first that such
   dynamics imply some rather simple bounds for phase-space variables, and
   in turn-remarkably, in an analytical way-they imply that various
   phase-space functions that were singular in the classical model are now
   well behaved. In particular, the expansion rate, its time derivative,
   and the shear become bounded, and hence the Raychaudhuri equation is
   finite term by term, thus resolving the singularities of classical
   geodesic congruences. Moreover, all effective scalar polynomial
   invariants turn out to be bounded.},

   protuberances on the genital plates; from Pergalumna paralongisetosa
   Ermilov \& Kaluz, 2012 by a diverging cerotegumental granulation on the
   notogaster. Pergalumna dactylaris sp. nov. differs from Pergalumna
   striata (Perez-Inigo \& Baggio, 1980) by its bigger size and the
   presence of three notogastric porose areas instead of four and from
   Pergalumna decorata Balogh \& Mahunka, 1977, also by the bigger size, a
   different position of setae lm and la and smaller but not minute

   alphabetical order. For each species, the type locality and the
   geographical distribution by country is provided. Particularly
   diversified taxa are Entiminae: Otiorhynchini (125 species),
   Brachycerinae: Raymondionymini (90 species), Cossoninae: Dryotribini (59
   species), Cryptorhynchinae: Torneumatini (58 species) and Molytinae:
   Lymantini (39 species). The biogeographic region with the highest
   diversity of soil-dwelling weevils is the Palearctic, especially the
   circum-Mediterranean area, mostly because of the exploration effort that
   it has received, followed by the Ethiopian and Neotropical regions.},

Abstract = {Phyllonoma laticuspis leaves are used in Carrizal de Bravo, Guerrero,
   Mexico, to heal skin lesions such as injuries and smallpox sequelae and
   to treat diabetes mellitus type 2, and organic extracts of these leaves
   have been reported to exert antibacterial effects. High demand of P.
   laticuspis as a medicinal plant has decreased its natural populations,
   and propagation of the species has not yet been reported. Therefore, the
   purpose of this study was to assess the vegetative propagation of the
   species through cutting and air layering, as well as its sexual
   propagation in a preserved population. For this, concentrations of 1
   000, 4 000 and 6 000 ppm of a commercial root enhancer, with indole
   butyric acid (IBA), and a control treatment without IBA, were applied to
   the cuttings and air layers. Germination was evaluated under light and
   dark conditions using lots of freshly collected seeds and lots of seeds
   that had been stored for three months at 4(circle)C or 24 +/-
   2(circle)C. All experiments were performed in a completely randomized
   design. The cuttings did not develop roots in any concentration, whereas
   100 \% of the air layers rooted, displaying vigorous roots in the
   presence of 4 000 ppm IBA, after four month of treatment application.
   Regarding germination, more than 60 \% of the freshly collected seeds
   germinated, whereas less than 20 \% of the seeds stored at 4(circle)C,
   and close to 50 \% of the seeds stored at 24 2(circle)C germinated under
   light and dark conditions. No significant differences were observed
   between light and dark conditions, so they were categorized as
   indifferent photoblastic seeds. The observed moisture content of 13.5 \%
   and germination behaviour as the response to cold storage, suggest that
   the resultant seed quality was intermediate. P. laticuspis propagation
   for short-term foliage production can be carried out in air layers, in
   populations with a high density of adult plants as a source of plant
   material and for the restoration of disturbed areas, in the same
   locality. On the other hand, large-scale seedling production, medium
   -term foliage production and preservation of species variability can be
   achieved using seeds.},

Title = {Relationship of inflammatory profile of elderly patients serum and
   senescence-associated secretory phenotype with human breast cancer cells
   proliferation: Role of IL6/IL8 ratio},
Journal = {CYTOKINE},

Abstract = {Aging is considered a systemic, chronic and low-grade inflammatory
   state, called ``inflammaging{''}, which has been contemplated as a risk
   factor for cancer development and progression in the elderly population.
   Cellular senescence is a multifactorial phenomenon of growth arrest and
   distorted function, which has been recognized as a contributor to aging.
   Senescent cells have an altered secretion pattern called Senescent
   Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), that comprise a complex mix of
   factors including cytokines, growth factors, chemokines and matrix
   metalloproteinases among others. The SASP secreted by accumulated
   senescent cells during old age has been related to local inflammation
   that leads to cellular transformation and therefore may be supporting
   the inflammaging process.
   Here, we evaluated if the pro-inflammatory profile within the serum
   obtained from elderly patients (EPS) was able to induce cellular
   proliferation in the breast cancer transformed cell line (MCF-7), in a
   similar way to the proliferation stimulated by the SASP obtained from
   WI-38 primary cells prematurely induced to senescence by oxidative
   stress (SIPS). At the same time, the participation of IL-6/IL-8 ratio
   was determined.
   Our results showed that not all the EPS increased MCF-7 proliferation.
   However, there was an interesting relationship between IL-6 and IL-8
   concentrations, when the IL-6 was higher than IL-8. Similar results were
   found with SASP from SIPS-WI-38 on the MCF-7 proliferation. Although it
   is known that those cytokines are fundamental factors to induce
   proliferation; the occurrence of other components in the cellular
   microenvironment is necessary to carry out this effect. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Cascabela is a Neotropical genus of Apocynaceae with six species: C.
   balsaensis, C. gaumeri, C. ovata, C. pinifolia, C. thevetia and C.
   thevetioides. Its taxonomic history has long been a subject of
   controversy, especially due to its circumscription as a genus closely
   related to Thevetia. In this work, we revised the taxonomy of Cascabela
   for Mexico and provide detailed descriptions and illustrations. We also
   applied species distribution models and geographical information tools
   to evaluate chorological aspects of the six species occurring in Mexico
   and provide a conservation category. According to our results, Cascabela
   has a typical tropical distribution within Mexico, and the Balsas basin
   was identified as an area of diversity and endemism for the genus. The
   species C. ovata and C. thevetia have the broadest distribution ranges,
   and we assigned them the category of least concern. We suggest that the
   restricted, endemic species C. balsaensis, C. pinifolia and C.
   thevetioides be considered for protection. The genus was corroborated as
   an element of deciduous forest, and its cultural importance is
   highlighted.},

Title = {Some solutions to the multivariate Behrens-Fisher problem for

Abstract = {The essence of the generalised multivariate Behrens-Fisher problem (BFP)
   is how to test the null hypothesis of equality of mean vectors for two
   or more populations when their dispersion matrices differ. Solutions to
   the BFP usually assume variables are multivariate normal and do not
   handle high-dimensional data. In ecology, species' count data are often
   high-dimensional, non-normal and heterogeneous. Also, interest lies in
   analysing compositional dissimilarities among whole communities in
   non-Euclidean (semi-metric or non-metric) multivariate space. Hence,
   dissimilarity-based tests by permutation (e.g., PERMANOVA, ANOSIM) are
   used to detect differences among groups of multivariate samples. Such
   tests are not robust, however, to heterogeneity of dispersions in the
   space of the chosen dissimilarity measure, most conspicuously for
   unbalanced designs. Here, we propose a modification to the PERMANOVA
   test statistic, coupled with either permutation or bootstrap resampling
   methods, as a solution to the BFP for dissimilarity-based tests.
   Empirical simulations demonstrate that the type I error remains close to
   nominal significance levels under classical scenarios known to cause
   problems for the un-modified test. Furthermore, the permutation approach
   is found to be more powerful than the (more conservative) bootstrap for
   detecting changes in community structure for real ecological datasets.
   The utility of the approach is shown through analysis of 809 species of
   benthic soft-sediment invertebrates from 101 sites in five areas
   spanning 1960km along the Norwegian continental shelf, based on the
   Jaccard dissimilarity measure.
   This article describes a new multivariate test for differences in
   centroids in the presence of heterogeneity of dispersions on the basis
   of a chosen dissimilarity measure.},

Abstract = {The Tantalus oscillator is a nonlinear system having a stable limit
   cycle. In this work we analytically obtain the Phase Transition Curve
   (PTC) finding a one-dimensional piecewise map which has a discontinuity.
   The map is defined by a function which was experimentally verified with
   an excellent consistency between theoretical and experimental results.
   We iterate the obtained map to predict the coupling behavior of the
   system under periodic perturbations, finding that it presents
   Periodicity Diagrams that display a high number of bistabilities. We
   experimentally show the occurrence of the predicted behaviors.
   Bifurcations among periodicities resulted Border Collision Bifurcations.
   Finally, by studying the Two-parametric Bifurcations Diagram we
   conjecture that there is at least one point in the diagram which
   corresponds to a Big Bang Bifurcation. This point appears when the
   perturbation intensity leads to the discontinuity loss in the PTC.},

Title = {Priming effects on seed germination of two perennial herb species in a

Abstract = {Priming has proved to enhance seed germination, but most of the research
   dealing with this topic has been carried out with cultivated species.
   The potential applications that this process has on wild species, which
   can be useful for restoration, are usually overlooked. This study
   analyses the germination response after natural priming and hydropriming
   of Penstemon roseus and Castilleja tenuiflora, two perennial herbs
   growing in a protected area known as Parque Ecologico de la Ciudad de
   Mexico'. Photoblastism was evaluated for both species. Seeds were
   exposed to a hydration/dehydration cycle and then placed in germination
   chambers to determine responses to hydropriming. To identify the effects
   of natural priming, seeds were buried in natural conditions and then
   recovered every two months and placed in germination chambers.
   Germination percentages and rates were then quantified. Both species
   proved to have permeable seed coats. Penstemon roseus seeds are positive
   photoblastic whereas C. tenuiflora seeds are indifferent to light.
   Priming methods increased C. tenuiflora germination rates, but they did
   not affect germination capacity. For P. roseus, priming methods did not
   improve germination rates, and germination capacity of recovered seeds
   decreased after the rainy season, suggesting that P. roseus forms a
   short-term, transient, seed bank. The germination strategies of these
   two species allow them to occupy suitable microsites for germination and
   establishment. These responses can be helpful in developing restoration
   programmes based on the accelerated establishment of native and
   characteristic successional species.},

Abstract = {Supply chain management problems are widespread across all economic
   activities. We analyze here how to address these in the case of the
   forest industry, which in emerging economies such as Argentina is
   subject to high logistic costs and faces problems of biological and
   economic sustainability. In this work, we analyze a management model
   covering from the schedule of harvesting activities and the
   transportation of raw materials to the final transformation at several
   industrial plants. Since this involves more than one objective,
   single-criterion mathematical programming methods are not appropriate.
   Here, instead, we introduce an extended goal programming formulation of
   the problem, able to yield good solutions in a computationally efficient
   way. We consider four goals: the maximization of the net present value
   of the production, the minimization of interannual variations in
   harvests, the maximization of carbon capture in the form of forest
   biomass, and the minimization of variations in the mean annual distance
   covered in transportation to the industrial plants. We apply this
   theoretical model to derive solutions for an actual Argentinean company.
   We show that the model reaches the target levels of the different goals,
   except for carbon balance, which is negative in all of the scenarios
   under evaluation.},

Abstract = {Around the world, species from the genus Tilia are commonly used because
   of their peripheral and central medicinal effects; they are prepared as
   teas and used as tranquilizing, anticonvulsant, and analgesic agents. In
   this study, we provide evidence of the protective effects of organic and
   aqueous extracts (100 mg/kg, i.p.) obtained from the leaves of Tilia
   americana var. mexicana on CCl4-induced liver and brain damage in the
   rat. Protection was observed in the liver and brain (cerebellum, cortex
   and cerebral hemispheres) by measuring the activity of antioxidant
   enzymes and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) using spectrophotometric
   methods. Biochemical parameters were also assessed in serum samples from
   the CCl4-treated rats. The T. americana var. mexicana leaf extracts
   provided significant protection against CCl4-induced peripheral and
   central damage by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes,
   diminishing lipid peroxidation, and preventing alterations in
   biochemical serum parameters, such as the levels of aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP), c-globulin (c-GLOB), serum albumin (ALB), total
   bilirubin (BB), creatinine (CREA) and creatine kinase (CK), relative to
   the control group. Additionally, we correlated gene expression with
   antioxidant activity in the experimental groups treated with the organic
   and aqueous Tilia extracts and observed a non-statistically significant
   positive correlation. Our results provide evidence of the underlying
   biomedical properties of T. americana var. mexicana that confer its
   neuro-and hepatoprotective effects. (C) 2016 The Authors. Production and

Pages = {39-50},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Lack of knowledge about the complex interactions between the dynamics of
   natural systems (physical, chemical and biological) and the need for the
   resources found in coastal environments has led to the unplanned and
   disorganized development of several anthropogenic activities in the
   study area. It is important to revert this tendency and promote medium
   term studies that can help to foresee the unwanted effects, sometimes
   irreversible, of human activities on the environment. This paper
   includes results from hydrodynamic and water quality studies carried out
   in Petacalco Bay, Guerrero (Mexican Pacific) in order to present
   elements for future appropriate management of industrial outflows in the
   region. Around this bay theft are important rivers and small villages, a
   major port, chemical and thermoelectric plants, all discharging their
   (generally untreated) effluents directly into the sea. The results of
   this study show that the overall water quality is similar to natural
   concentrations found in the ocean. Nevertheless, eutrophization was
   found, associated with the fertilizer industry, and the hot water
   discharge from the thermoelectric plant generates hot plumes, which
   dissipate in the environment, despite the intense and variable
   hydrodynamic characteristics of the region.},

Abstract = {Recognition that tree recruitment depends on the balance between seed
   arrival and seedling survival has led to a surge of interest in
   seed-dispersal limitation and seedling-establishment limitation in
   primary forests. Virtually unaddressed are comparisons of this balance
   in mature and early successional habitats. We assessed seed rain and
   seedling recruitment dynamics of tree species in primary forest,
   secondary forest and pasture released from grazing in a tropical
   agricultural landscape. Seed to seedling ratios (seed effectiveness;
   Phi(i)) for 43 species in southern Mexico determined differences in the
   extent to which seeds produced seedlings by habitat, life history, and
   dispersal mode. Reproductive potential as estimated by the transition
   from seed rain to seedling recruitment, differed by habitats, and varied
   dramatically by life history and dispersal mode. Expected recruit
   densities (E-it) were higher for animal-dispersed than wind-dispersed
   species, and for non-pioneer than pioneer species. Non-pioneers and
   animal-dispersed species had higher expected relative recruit abundance
   (epsilon(it)) in primary forest (median of 4 seeds recruit(-1)) whereas
   in secondary forest wind-dispersed pioneers had the highest expected
   relative recruit abundance (median of 16 seeds per recruit). In
   pastures, wind-dispersed pioneer species were most successful with many
   more seeds per recruit (median of 291) than both forest habitats. Seeds
   per recruit (Phi(i)) appeared to decrease with increase in seed mass for
   43 species for which data were available (r = -0.55, P < 0.001). This
   was associated with a negative correlation of Phi(i) with seed size in
   primary forest (r = -0.50, P = 0.08 for 13 species); Phi(i) was not
   correlated with seed size in secondary forest (n = 16) or pasture (n =
   14). Metrics of seeds per recruit, expected recruit density and expected
   relative recruit abundance dramatically illustrate differences in
   barriers to recruitment in successional habitats.},

Title = {A list of Yuukianura Yosii, 1955 species of the world
   (Collembola: Neanuridae: Neanurinae: Lobellini), with description of a
   new species of unusual ecology from Santo Island (Vanuatu)},

Abstract = {We redefine the genus Yuukianura Yosii, 1955, and we give an updated
   list of its nine species. Four of these species initially described in
   other genera are transferred to Yuukianura: Lobella (Lobella) yasudai
   Yosii, 1966, Lobella pacifica Yosii, 1971, Protanura hawaiiensis
   Bellinger \& Christiansen, 1974, and Pseudocolonavis rosea Kim \& Lee,
   2000. Two species described as Yuukianura (Yuukianura cavicola Yosii,
   1956 and Y. nomurai Yosii, 1956) are considered as Lobellini incertae
   sedis. A new species, Yuukianura judithae n. sp., is described from
   Santo Island in Vanuatu, Melanesia. It differs from other species of the
   genus by a combination of characters including total lack of eyes, two
   chaetae on the ocular tubercle (Ocp absent), (5 + 5) dorsal chaetae on
   Th. I, (3 + S) chaetae in chaetal group DL of Th. II-III, two chaetae in
   group Di of Abd. I-IV (Di3 absent) and untoothed claw. The species also
   shows three characters unusual for Neanurinae Boerner, 1901: a strong
   reduction of tibiotarsal chaetotaxy, the absence of macrochaeta De1 on
   Abd. I-IV and the presence of conspicuous buttonhole structures dorsally
   on head, Abd. I and Abd. IV. The new species occurs in both forest and
   cave habitats, not in mangrove or seashore habitats, in contrast to most
   members of the genus. In caves, it often lives in large number on guano
   piles of bats or swiftlets, and is the first record of a Neanuridae
   Yosii, 1956 in such an habitat.},

Title = {Evidence of mixed valence Cr/Cr in YCaCrO polycrystalline ceramics by

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {YCaCrO polycrystalline ceramics with 0.000 x 0.100 compositions were
   studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS). The results revealed that the Cr-O average bond length decreases
   with increasing Ca content. This fact infers that the charge
   compensation is through the change from Cr to Cr instead of oxygen
   vacancies. To confirm this supposition, the high-resolution XPS study
   revealed that as the Ca is introduced in the YCrO matrix, the Cr 2p
   core-level is well fitted at 576.22 and 577.57 eV belonging at Cr and Cr
   core-level, respectively. Furthermore, we found an increase of the
   valence band XPS spectra at the Fermi energy as the Ca replaces the Y
   site. This fact suggests an increase of the Cr 3d-state at the Fermi
   energy, which is confirmed by the XPS valence band spectra and the
   electrical conductivity measurements.},

Abstract = {The alteration of biophysical conditions in cities limits restoration
   and management of ecosystems in urban areas. The Pedregal de San Angel
   Ecological Reserve (PSAER) protects important remnants of a unique type
   of xeric scrub in a lava field embedded in Mexico City. Unearthing and
   replacing basalt rock have been carried out in PSAER to recover rocky
   basalt substrate, a physical feature in this type of location, in areas
   where it has been removed or buried and invading species have become
   predominant. To obtain an overview of the recovery of the plant
   community following restoration actions, we sampled and compared
   vegetation structure in terms of species richness, composition, relative
   coverage and diversity in 12 sites of PSAER: five conserved areas, three
   restored areas, and four disturbed areas. Restored areas presented
   intermediate values with respect to those in conserved and disturbed
   areas for total and non-ruderal native species richness, Simpson
   dominance index, and relative cover of non-ruderal and exotic species.
   Our results show that replacing and unearthing rock are still
   insufficient but are promising methods to promote restoration of this
   xeric scrub and similar plant communities that develop on lava fields.},

Abstract = {The Liolaemid genus Phymaturus is a clade of saxicolous lizards with 44
   species recognized, grouped in the Phymaturus palluma and the Phymaturus
   patagonicus groups. The chromosome data about this genus are extremely
   scarce; however, unpublished evidence suggests a great karyotypic
   diversity, mainly in the P. palluma group. In this work, we describe the
   karyotypes of six species of the P. palluma group (one of them unnamed)
   and report a multiple chromosome sex determination system with
   heterogametic males (X1X1X2X2 / X1X2Y). This sex-system represents a
   putative synapomorphy for the group. In accordance with the published
   literature and data obtained in this study, we report a wide variability
   for the diploid number of the P. palluma group (2N = 26 to 36) but same
   autosomic fundamental number in all the species of the clade (FNa = 32).
   Such variation is a consequence of different numbers of telocentric
   macroautosome pairs among karyotypes (2 to 10), suggesting chromosomal
   evolution of the group, driven mainly by successive Robertsonian
   rearrangements.},

Title = {A study of carbonate beach sands from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico: a
   case study},
Journal = {CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sedimentological, geochemical, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses in
   addition to the determination of biogenic fraction components (BFC) were
   performed in mollusk shells from carbonate beach samples collected on
   the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The most abundant
   components of the BFC were bivalves and gastropods shells, ranging from
   88.1 to 99.2 \% and from 0.1 to 6.0 \%, respectively, followed by minor
   percentages of foraminifera, coral fragments, bryozoa, oolites,
   spicules, and ostracods. A combination of major element, trace element,
   and XRD techniques were performed to show how the Mg/Ca and Mg/Sr ratios
   determine the possibility of a recrystallization process in bivalves and
   gastropods, which may be attributed to early diagenetic mechanisms
   caused by groundwater flows, subaerial exposure, high evaporation rates,
   and neomorphism. The rare earth element analyses gave the average
   anomalies for the following ratios (Pr/Yb)(PAAS and MuQ) ratio > 1,
   (Eu/Eu{*})(PAAS and MuQ) and (Ce/Ce{*})(PAAS and MuQ) < 1, suggesting
   little incorporation of sea water in the BFC of the shells from the
   Yucatan beach sands. This is also supported by the flat pattern trends
   of bivalves and gastropods based on the normalized patterns of light
   rare earth element compared to heavy rare earth element concentrations.
   This paper is also a contribution to the methodology of analysis of
   carbonate sands, i.e., whole bulk composition isolation into their main
   biogenic components and the accumulation of major, trace, and rare earth
   elements deposited into their shells, initially under subaquatic marine
   conditions and currently exposed to subaerial coastal influences based
   on the allochthonous character of the shells.},

Abstract = {The use of pesticides may affect the aquatic ecosystem. Through soil,
   these contaminants are drained into rivers. In South America,
   glyphosate-base herbicides, such as Roundup, are widely used in
   agricultural activities. In this work, the genotoxic effects of Roundup
   Full II (R) were evaluated in blood, gill and liver cells of Piaractus
   mesopotamicus, species of great ecological and commercial value in South
   America. Previously, the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) for 96 h of
   exposure was determined, with a theoretical value of 8.92mgl(-1).
   Genotoxic analysis in cells of the three tissues was performed by the
   comet, micronuclei (MN) and nuclear abnormalities (NA) assays after 96 h
   exposing fish to a sub-lethal concentration of Roundup Full II (R)
   (2.75mgl(-1)). Comet assay results for the three tissues showed a
   significantly greater damage compared to the negative control and no
   statistical differences were observed between tissues responses. For MN
   and NA significantly higher frequencies were also demonstrated,
   indicating diverse kinds of damage like clastogenic events in the three
   tissues, with gills being the most sensitive one.},

Abstract = {In this work, we report a simple fabrication method for microelectrodes
   on a polymethylmethacrylate substrate, using a low-cost laser platform
   based on a CDDVD unit for direct rapid-prototyping. We used this laser
   microfabrication technique to etch any desired design on
   polymethylmethacrylate substrates to produce micro-channels with
   controlled geometry, with a highly repeatable micron-scale resolution.
   Those shallow micro-channels were then filled with a conductive paste of
   material of our choice that was converted into microelectrodes of
   desired shapes and geometries after drying. To validate our process,
   different geometries, sizes and materials were used as electrodes, and
   then tested for amperometry and impedance measurements. Development of
   these microelectrodes is motivated by their potential application in
   sensors and biosensors, such as glucose and cell counting, as
   demonstrated in this paper.},

Abstract = {Plagioptychids are a conspicuous, although minor, component in uppermost
   Cretaceous rudist-bearing outcrops of the Caribbean Province, where
   other rudist families are more abundant and diverse. In the Chiapas
   Central Depression, the plagioptychid rudist fauna includes the
   following taxa: Plagioptychus antillarum (Douville) and Mitrocaprina sp.
   from the middle Campanian Suchiapa Formation, Plagioptychus muellerriedi
   Alencaster from the early Maastrichtian Ocozocoautla Formation, and
   Plagioptychus fragilis Chubb and Mitrocaprina tschoppi (Palmer) from the
   late Maastrichtian Angostura Formation. These five species are described
   in detail and some probable synonymies are discussed. Analysis of the
   literature on American plagioptychids reveals that the characters of too
   many taxa are still insufficiently known to attempt any thorough
   phylogenetic analysis. Other lines of evidence also seem to indicate
   that American Plagioptychidae diversity is probably higher than
   recognized today, which might result in a more significant difference to
   Plagioptychidae of the Mediterranean Tethys.},

Abstract = {A unicellular cyanobacterium, strain Alchichica-D10, was isolated from
   microbialites of the alkaline Lake Alchichica, Mexico. The cells were
   short rods (3.9 +/- 0.6 mu m in length and 1.1 +/- 0.1 mu m in width)
   forming biofilms of intense emerald green colour. They exhibited red
   autofluorescence under UV light excitation. UV-visible absorption
   spectra revealed that they contain chlorophyll a and phycocyanin, and
   electron microscopy showed the presence of thylakoids. The strain grew
   within a temperature range of 15-30 degrees C. Genomic DNA G+C content
   was 52.2 mol\%. The most remarkable feature of this species was its
   granular cytoplasm, due to the presence of numerous intracellular
   spherical granules (16-26 per cell) with an average diameter of 270 nm.
   These granules, easily visible under scanning electron microscopy, were
   composed of amorphous carbonate containing Ca, Mg, Ba and Sr. A
   multi-gene phylogeny based on the analysis of 59 conserved protein
   markers supported robustly that this strain occupies a deep position in
   the cyanobacterial tree. Based on its phenotypic characters and
   phylogenetic position, strain Alchichica-D10 is considered to represent
   a new genus and novel species of cyanobacteria for which the name
   Gloeomargarita lithophora gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type
   strain is Alchichica-D10 (Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa CCAP
   strain 1437/1; Collections de Cyanobacteries et Microalgues Vivantes of
   the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris strain PMC 919.15).
   Furthermore, a new family, Gloeomargaritaceae, and a new order,
   Gloeoemargaritales, are proposed to accommodate this species under the
   International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants.},

Abstract = {A novel efficient method to calculate the scattering matrix (SM) of
   arbitrary tight-binding Hamiltonians is proposed, including cases with
   multiterminal structures. In particular, the SM of two kinds of
   fundamental structures is given, which can be used to obtain the SM of
   bigger systems iteratively. Also, a procedure to obtain the SM of
   layer-composed periodic leads is described. This method allows
   renormalization approaches, which permits computations over macroscopic
   length systems without introducing additional approximations. Finally,
   the transmission coefficient of a ring shaped multiterminal system and
   the transmission function of a square-lattice nanoribbon with a reduced
   width region are calculated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Demographic Drivers of Aboveground Biomass Dynamics During Secondary

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The magnitude of the carbon sink in second-growth forests is expected to
   vary with successional biomass dynamics resulting from tree growth,
   recruitment, and mortality, and with the effects of climate on these
   dynamics. We compare aboveground biomass dynamics of dry and wet
   Neotropical forests, based on monitoring data gathered over 3-16 years
   in forests covering the first 25 years of succession. We estimated
   standing biomass, annual biomass change, and contributions of tree
   growth, recruitment, and mortality. We also evaluated tree species'
   contributions to biomass dynamics. Absolute rates of biomass change were
   lower in dry forests, 2.3 and 1.9 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), after 5-15 and 15-25
   years after abandonment, respectively, than in wet forests, with 4.7 and
   6.1 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), in the same age classes. Biomass change was largely
   driven by tree growth, accounting for at least 48\% of biomass change
   across forest types and age classes. Mortality also contributed strongly
   to biomass change in wet forests of 5-15 years, whereas its contribution
   became important later in succession in dry forests. Biomass dynamics
   tended to be dominated by fewer species in early-successional dry than
   wet forests, but dominance was strong in both forest types. Overall, our
   results indicate that biomass dynamics during succession are faster in
   Neotropical wet than dry forests, with high tree mortality earlier in
   succession in the wet forests. Long-term monitoring of second-growth
   tropical forest plots is crucial for improving estimates of annual
   biomass change, and for enhancing understanding of the underlying
   mechanisms and demographic drivers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess how bird communities are grouped
   in vegetation types between the breeding and non-breeding seasons in two
   consecutive years as well as the relationship between bird species'
   distribution and the main plant communities, all in a desert wetland in
   northern Mexico. We used transects to determine the bird species'
   abundances and the height and cover of vegetation to obtain three main
   variables: foliage height diversity, life form diversity, and total
   foliage density. Cluster analyses using the bird species' relative
   abundances grouped similar vegetation types, regardless of the
   geographic distance between them, during the breeding season but not in
   the non-reproductive season. This result suggests that birds occupy the
   various habitats in a random way during the non-reproductive season.
   Most of the bird species were closely related to the vegetation volume
   and foliage height diversity in both seasons, while the diversity of
   plant growth forms was of little importance.},

Abstract = {Sceloporus bicanthalis inhabits the Nevado de Toluca, M,xico, and the
   males exhibit continuous spermatogenesis with mature sperm available
   year round. Females were collected monthly to evaluate the morphology of
   the oviducts and the presence of sperm storage. Histological examination
   revealed that the oviductal structure in this lizard is similar to that
   described for other lacertilian species: anterior infundibulum,
   glandular uterus, and a posterior non-glandular uterus. The oviduct wall
   consists of a superficial visceral pleuroperitoneum, a middle layer of
   smooth muscle with outer longitudinal and inner circular fibers, and a
   deep mucosa or lamina propria deeply lined by an epithelium containing
   ciliated and non-ciliated secretory cells. Spermatozoa are stored at the
   base of the mucosal folds, in crypts and in sperm storage tubules at the
   transition between the glandular uterus and non-glandular uterus, as
   well as in the anterior non-glandular uterus of previtellogenic,
   vitellogenic, pregnant, and postpartum females. The sperm in the
   oviductal cavity or in retention sites is in contact with secretory
   products derived from non-ciliated epithelial cells. Spermatozoa usually
   assume an orderly distribution with their heads aligned and oriented
   toward the base of the folds or crypts. This study shows that females of
   S. bicanthalis exhibit prolonged sperm storage that corresponds with the
   continuous reproductive strategy employed by males.},

Title = {The surrounding landscape influences the diversity of leaf-litter ants
   in riparian cloud forest remnants},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Riparian vegetation is a distinctive and ecologically important element
   of landscapes worldwide. However, the relative influence of the
   surrounding landscape on the conservation of the biodiversity of
   riparian remnants in human-modified tropical landscapes is poorly
   understood. We studied the surrounding landscape to evaluate its
   influence on leaf-litter-ant alpha and beta diversity in riparian
   remnants in the tropical montane cloud forest region of central
   Veracruz, Mexico. Sampling was carried out in 12 sites with riparian
   vegetation during both rainy (2011) and dry (2012) seasons. Ten
   leaf-litter samples were collected along a 100-m transect per site and
   processed with Berlese-Tullgren funnels and Winkler sacks. Using
   remotely-sensed and ground-collected data, we characterized the
   landscape around each site according to nine land cover types and
   computed metrics of landscape composition and configuration. We
   collected a total of 8,684 ant individuals belonging to 53 species, 22
   genera, 11 tribes, and 7 subfamilies. Species richness and the diversity
   of Shannon and Simpson increased significantly in remnants immersed in
   landscapes with a high percentage of riparian land cover and a low
   percentage of land covers with areas reforested with Pinus, cattle
   pastures, and human settlements and infrastructure. The composition of
   ant assemblages was a function of the percentage of riparian land cover
   in the landscape. This study found evidence that leaf-litter ants, a
   highly specialized guild of arthropods, are mainly impacted by landscape
   composition and the configuration of the focal remnant. Maintaining or
   improving the surrounding landscape quality of riparian vegetation
   remnants can stimulate the movement of biodiversity among forest and
   riparian remnants and foster the provision of ecosystem services by
   these ecosystems. Effective outcomes may be achieved by considering
   scientific knowledge during the early stages of riparian policy
   formulation, in addition to integrating riparian management strategies
   with broader environmental planning instruments.},

Title = {Analysis of spatial mobility in subjects from a Dengue endemic urban
   locality in Morelos State, Mexico},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Mathematical models and field data suggest that human mobility is an
   important driver for Dengue virus transmission. Nonetheless little is
   known on this matter due the lack of instruments for precise mobility
   quantification and study design difficulties.
   Materials and methods
   We carried out a cohort-nested, case-control study with 126 individuals
   (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with
   the goal of describing human mobility patterns of recently Dengue
   virus-infected subjects, and comparing them with those of noninfected
   subjects living in an urban endemic locality. Mobility was quantified
   using a GPSdata logger registering way points at 60-second intervals for
   a minimum of 15 natural days.
   Results
   Although absolute displacement was highly biased towards the
   intradomestic and peridomestic areas, occasional displacements exceeding
   a 100-Km radius from the center of the studied locality were recorded
   for all three study groups and individual displacements were recorded
   traveling across six states from central Mexico. Additionally, cases had
   a larger number of visits out of the municipality's administrative
   limits when compared to intradomestic controls (cases: 10.4 versus
   intradomestic controls: 2.9, p = 0.0282). We were able to identify
   extradomestic places within and out of the locality that were
   independently visited by apparently non-related infected subjects,
   consistent with houses, working and leisure places.
   Conclusions
   Results of this study show that human mobility in a small urban setting
   exceeded that considered by local health authority's administrative
   limits, and was different between recently infected and non-infected
   subjects living in the same household. These observations provide
   important insights about the role that human mobility may have in Dengue
   virus transmission and persistence across endemic geographic areas that
   need to be taken into account when planning preventive and control
   measures. Finally, these results are a valuable reference when setting
   the parameters for future mathematical modeling studies.},

Title = {The nature of allometry in an exaggerated trait: The postocular flange
   in Platyneuromus Weele (Insecta: Megaloptera)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The origin and function of exaggerated traits exhibited by a great
   number of species with sexual dimorphism remain largely unexplored. The
   usual model considered as the evolutionary mechanism for the development
   of these structures is sexual selection. The nature of growth of the
   postocular flange (POF) in three species of the dobsonfly genus
   Platyneuromus (Megaloptera, Corydalidae, Corydalinae) is analyzed to
   explore sexual size dimorphism and allometric scaling. Results involve
   positive allometry of POF in males of two species, and negative
   allometry in males of one species, in general with a female-biased
   sexual dimorphism. We suggest an ancestral condition of dual incipient
   ornamentation in Platyneuromus, with a subsequent departure of size and
   shape of POF in males, triggered by sexual selection. Different sexual
   selection intensities may explain the parallel or divergent growth of
   POF within the scheme of dual ornamentation. Empirical behavioral data
   as well as a phylogenetic framework are necessary to clarify possible
   causes of phenotypic development, time of origin, and evolution of the
   POF.},

Abstract = {Hybridization represents an important mechanism in the diversification
   of Cactaceae where interspecific barriers are poorly developed. Putative
   hybrids with an intermediate phenotype between the columnar cacti
   Escontria chiotilla and Polaskia chichipe were observed in Oaxaca,
   Mexico. The putative hybrids grow sympatrically with their parents,
   sharing pollinators and overlapping flowering periods. On the basis of
   morphological, genetic and molecular studies, we show that a gene flow
   occurs between E. chiotilla and P. chichipe. Morphological and genetic
   similarities were used to carry out phenetic analyses, which allowed us
   to separate the two taxa and the potential hybrids, and cluster them
   into discrete groups with a high degree of consistency. We also generate
   artificial hybrids by hand-pollination crosses. These hybrids indicate
   that there are partial pre-and postzygotic barriers between E. chiotilla
   and P. chichipe. Backcrosses between parents and hybrids produced viable
   seeds, suggesting that there is a high potential of introgression with
   both parents. Taken together, we propose that hybrids observed in the
   field are the product of cross-pollination between E. chiotilla and P.
   chichipe. Thus, gene flow between both genera can explain why the
   genetic independence of these taxa has not kept them reproductively
   isolated. A complete description and illustrations of a new intergeneric
   hybrid are provided.},

Title = {Black holes in quasi-topological gravity and conformal couplings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Lovelock theory of gravity provides a tractable model to investigate the
   effects of higher-curvature terms in the context of AdS/CFT. Yielding
   second order, ghost-free field equations, this theory represents a
   minimal setup in which higher-order gravitational couplings in
   asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces, including black holes, can
   be solved analytically. This however has an obvious limitation as in
   dimensions lower than seven, the contribution from cubic or higher
   curvature terms is merely topological. Therefore, in order to go beyond
   quadratic order and study higher terms in AdS5 analytically, one is
   compelled to look for other toy models. One such model is the so-called
   quasi-topological gravity, which, despite being a higher-derivative
   theory, provides a tractable setup with R-3 and R-4 terms. In this
   paper, we investigate AdS5 black holes in quasi-topological gravity. We
   consider the theory conformally coupled to matter and in presence of
   Abelian gauge fields. We show that charged black holes in AdS5 which, in
   addition, exhibit a backreaction of the matter fields on the geometry
   can be found explicitly in this theory. These solutions generalize the
   black hole solution of quasi-topological gravity and exist in a region
   of the parameter spaces consistent with the constraints coming from
   causality and other consistency conditions. They have finite conserved
   charges and exhibit non-trivial thermodynamical properties.},

Abstract = {How energetic cost of locomotion affects foraging decisions, and its
   metabolic consequences are poorly understood. In several groups of
   animals, including hermit crabs, exploratory walking enhances the
   efficiency of foraging by increasing the probability of finding more and
   better food items; however, the net gain of energy will only be enhanced
   if the costs of walking are lower than the benefits of enhanced food
   acquisition. In hermit crabs, the cost of walking increases with the
   mass of the shell type occupied. Thus, we expected that hermit crabs
   should adjust their foraging strategy to the cost of movement in
   different shells. We assessed the foraging, the quantity and quality of
   food intake, and the energetic cost of maintenance of hermit crabs
   paying different costs of foraging in the wild. The exploratory walking
   negatively correlated with shell mass, showing that hermit crabs use
   different foraging strategies in response to the expenditure required to
   move. Hermit crabs deal with high energetic costs of foraging in heavy
   shells by reduces their exploratory walking and overall metabolic rate,
   as a strategy to maximize the net energy intake. This study integrates
   behavioral and metabolic compensations as a response to foraging at
   different costs in natural conditions.},

Title = {Long-term population dynamics reveal that survival and recruitment of
   tropical boobies improve after a hurricane},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {320-332},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Variability in population numbers is a central issue in evolutionary
   ecology and also in biodiversity conservation. However, for most
   seabirds this information is lacking and tropical populations are
   virtually unstudied. Long-term studies are warranted because world's
   seabird populations exhibit an overall declining trend since 1950. Using
   data spanning 23 yr, we investigated how adult survival, local
   recruitment, and their relative contributions to population growth ()
   vary over time in the blue-footed booby Sula nebouxii, a long-lived
   locally foraging seabird that breeds in tropical waters. In addition, we
   investigated whether booby demographic rates exhibit the same declining
   trend observed in other seabirds, whether these rates are impacted by
   hurricanes, and whether these potential impacts differ between sexes.
   Our analysis of 4608 capture-recapture histories revealed that survival
   and recruitment were nearly equal between males and females, exhibited a
   declining trend over the last 23 yr, and in both sexes, these vital
   rates improved after a hurricane. The declining trend in recruitment was
   slightly more attenuated in males. These results add to the current
   evidence for an overall declining trend in world's seabird populations
   and extend its confirmation to the warm eastern tropical Pacific.
   Moreover, they provide the first evidence that hurricanes may favor
   natural populations. As a result of the declining trend and variation in
   survival and recruitment, exhibited a slight decline and substantial
   variation over the 23 yr. However, most values were equal to or higher
   than 1, and the long-term average indicates population increase. The
   ability of blue-footed boobies to maintain a positive population balance
   despite of negative trends in their vital rates might result from
   canalization of adult survival (the vital rate that contributes most to
   and shows lower variation compared to recruitment) against environmental
   variability.},

Title = {Multiple successional pathways in human-modified tropical landscapes:
   new insights from forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape
   ecology research},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests are being extensively deforested and
   fragmented worldwide. Yet forest recovery through succession has led to
   an expansion of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes
   (HMTLs). Secondary forests thus emerge as a potential repository for
   tropical biodiversity, and also as a source of essential ecosystem
   functions and services in HMTLs. Such critical roles are controversial,
   however, as they depend on successional, landscape and socio-economic
   dynamics, which can vary widely within and across landscapes and
   regions. Understanding the main drivers of successional pathways of
   disturbed tropical forests is critically needed for improving
   management, conservation, and restoration strategies. Here, we combine
   emerging knowledge from tropical forest succession, forest fragmentation
   and landscape ecology research to identify the main driving forces
   shaping successional pathways at different spatial scales. We also
   explore causal connections between land-use dynamics and the level of
   predictability of successional pathways, and examine potential
   implications of such connections to determine the importance of
   secondary forests for biodiversity conservation in HMTLs. We show that
   secondary succession (SS) in tropical landscapes is a multifactorial
   phenomenon affected by a myriad of forces operating at multiple
   spatio-temporal scales. SS is relatively fast and more predictable in
   recently modified landscapes and where well-preserved biodiversity-rich
   native forests are still present in the landscape. Yet the increasing
   variation in landscape spatial configuration and matrix heterogeneity in
   landscapes with intermediate levels of disturbance increases the
   uncertainty of successional pathways. In landscapes that have suffered
   extensive and intensive human disturbances, however, succession can be
   slow or arrested, with impoverished assemblages and reduced potential to
   deliver ecosystem functions and services. We conclude that: (i)
   succession must be examined using more comprehensive explanatory models,
   providing information about the forces affecting not only the presence
   but also the persistence of species and ecological groups, particularly
   of those taxa expected to be extirpated from HMTLs; (ii) SS research
   should integrate new aspects from forest fragmentation and landscape
   ecology research to address accurately the potential of secondary
   forests to serve as biodiversity repositories; and (iii) secondary
   forest stands, as a dynamic component of HMTLs, must be incorporated as
   key elements of conservation planning; i.e. secondary forest stands must
   be actively managed (e.g. using assisted forest restoration) according
   to conservation goals at broad spatial scales.},

   and the curvature hyperbolas associated with its second fundamental
   form. Besides the four natural invariants, new invariants appear in some
   degenerate situations. We then introduce the Gauss map of a Lorentzian
   surface and give an extrinsic proof of the vanishing of the total Gauss
   and normal curvatures of a compact Lorentzian surface. The Gauss map and
   the second-order invariants are then used to study the asymptotic
   directions of a Lorentzian surface and discuss their causal character.
   We also consider the relation of the asymptotic lines with the mean
   directionally curved lines. We finally introduce and describe the
   quasi-umbilic surfaces, and the surfaces whose four classical invariants
   vanish identically.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Amodel derived in (Klein et al., J Fluid Mech 288: 201-248, 1995) for n
   nearparallel vortex filaments in a three dimensional fluid region takes
   into consideration the pairwise interaction between the filaments along
   with an approximation for motion by self-induction. The same system of
   equations appears in descriptions of the fine structure of vortex
   filaments in the Gross-Pitaevski model of Bose-Einstein condensates. In
   this paper we construct families of standingwaves for this model, in the
   form of n co-rotating near-parallel vortex filaments that are situated
   in a central configuration. This result applies to any pair of vortex
   filaments with the same circulation, corresponding to the case n = 2.
   The model equations can be formulated as a system of Hamiltonian PDEs,
   and the construction of standing waves is a small divisor problem. The
   methods are a combination of the analysis of infinite dimensional
   Hamiltonian dynamical systems and linear theory related to Anderson
   localization. The main technique of the construction is the Nash-Moser
   method applied to a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, giving rise to a
   bifurcation equation over a Cantor set of parameters.},

Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {121-127},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There is a tendency for non-native English scientists to publish
   exclusively in English, assuming that this will make their articles more
   visible and cited. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effect of
   language on the number of citations of articles published in six natural
   sciences journals from five countries that publish papers in either
   English or other languages. We analyzed the effect of language (English
   vs non-English), paper length, and year of publication on the number of
   citations. The articles published in English have a higher number of
   citations than those published in other languages, when the effect of
   journal, year of publication, and paper length are statistically
   controlled. This may result because English articles are accessible to a
   larger audience, but other factors need to be explored. Universities and
   scientific institutions should be aware of this situation and improve
   the teaching of English, especially in the natural sciences.},

Abstract = {We implemented a temporally dynamic approach to the cladistic
   biogeographic analysis of 13 areas of North American deserts and several
   plant and animal taxa. We undertook a parsimony analysis of
   paralogy-free subtrees based on 43 phylogenetic hypotheses of arthropod,
   vertebrate and plant taxa, assigning their nodes to three different time
   slices based on their estimated minimum ages: Early-Mid-Miocene
   (23-7Ma), Late Miocene/Pliocene (6.9-2.5Ma) and Pleistocene
   (2.4-0.011Ma). The analyses resulted in three general area cladograms,
   one for each time slice, showing different area relationships. They
   allowed us to detect influences of different geological and
   palaeoclimatological events of the Early-Mid-Miocene, Late
   Miocene/Pliocene and Pleistocene that might have affected the
   diversification of the desert biota. Several diversification events in
   the deserts of North America might have been driven by Neogene uplift,
   marine incursion and the opening of the California Gulf during the
   Miocene-Pliocene, whereas climatic fluctuations had the highest impact
   during the Pleistocene.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of decadal change of a mangrove forest in the
   North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {167-175},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services, but are under
   constant pressure from natural, anthropogenic, and climate change
   related disturbances. Environmental drivers on mangrove change at large
   spatial scales, other than sea level rise, are not well understood. In
   here, we use spatially explicit methods to identify the main
   environmental drivers of mangrove coverage change over a decade in the
   landscape of the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. A
   post-supervised classification approach on seven SPOT 5 multispectral
   satellite images was used to construct thematic maps of mangrove
   coverage between 2004 and 2014. A linear regression model between the
   thematic maps was performed to estimate the mangrove coverage change
   rate per pixel. Climate surfaces for annual maximum, minimum and mean
   temperature, and annual mean and cumulative precipitation for the region
   were calculated for the period 1980-2009 using data obtained from the
   National Meteorological Service. The effect of environmental variables
   on mangrove coverage change rates was assessed with a boosted
   generalized additive model (boosted GAM). The lowest and highest overall
   accuracy obtained for the time series thematic maps were 87.14\% (Kappa
   = 0.78), and 97.5\% (Kappa = 0.95), respectively. The most influential
   environmental variables on mangrove coverage change were annual
   cumulative precipitation (21\%), and annual maximum temperature (9\%).
   Current climate change scenarios for the region predict an increase in
   temperature and a decrease in precipitation, intensifying environmental
   stress on this ecosystem. Therefore, adequate management strategies are
   fundamental to help maintain the mangrove forest under changing
   environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {The presence of a male in a population of terrestrial isopods can
   accelerate the onset of female reproduction, a feature that has been
   suggested also to occur in bopyrid isopods. This paper aims to estimate
   the influence of the male presence on the ovarian maturation of Bopyrina
   abbreviata. Females of B. abbreviata of different sizes were collected
   at Terminos lagoon, Campeche, Mexico. The organisms were
   morphometrically classified as immature or mature, the male presence or
   absence at female's marsupium was recorded, and the degree of ovarian
   development was determined histologically. The internal organization of
   B. abbreviata agrees with that described for bopyrids and isopods in
   general. The ovarian cells originate from a dorsal lamina germinal layer
   that extends horizontally. The ovarian development of lone and paired
   immature females was classified as incipient and medium, respectively.
   In mature females it was classified as advanced, in the paired females
   and in the one lone mature female studied. The lone mature female
   differed from paired mature females only in the presence of reabsorption
   process in some oocytes located closer to the ventral wall of the ovary.
   Morphology variations between lone and paired females suggests that the
   presence of a cryptoniscus larva or a male between the female's pleopods
   stimulates the onset of reproduction and accelerates the ovarian
   development of B. abbreviata.},

Title = {Fishing operations and adaptive strategies of small-scale fishers:
   insights for fisheries management in data-poor situations},
Journal = {FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries' management is complex given its multigear,
   multispecies nature; despite this, fishing effort has usually been
   controlled by nominal units, ignoring changes in effective fishing
   effort. This study aimed to understand the adaptive strategies of
   small-scale fishers in San Felipe, Yucatan, Mexico through an analysis
   of their fishing operations. Minor changes in trip numbers among three
   seasons were observed, but increases in fishing time, depth and travel
   costs from one season to another at the operational level were found. It
   was also evident that high value species at the beginning of the season
   were gradually replaced by low-value finfish as the season progresses.
   The results provide insights for new adaptive management strategies
   according to fisher's adaptive responses. For instance, using boats or
   fishing trips as fishing effort units in Yucatan may not be the most
   appropriated unit for management, as fishers adapt their strategies at
   different levels.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {118},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Interleukin (IL) 16 and thymus and activation-regulated
   cytokine (TARC) are chemoattractant cytokines for eosinophils and TH2
   cells. Differential levels of these components in aspirin-exacerbated
   respiratory disease (AERD) and allergic rhinitis with asthma (ARwA) may
   be related to a different inflammatory response in both asthma
   phenotypes.
   Objective: To assess the nasal lavage immunoreactivity of IL-16 and TARC
   cytokines.
   Methods: We used multienzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect IL-5,
   IL-13, IL-16, IL-33, I-309/CCL1, TARC/CCL17, monocyte-derived
   chemokine/CCL22, periostin, and eosinophil cationic protein levels in
   nasal lavages from patients with AERD and patients with ARwA.
   Results: The IL-13, IL-16, TARC, and periostin levels were significantly
   higher in patients with AERD compared with those of patients with ARwA.
   Correlation analysis of mediator levels in AERD revealed a possible role
   of IL-16 and TARC in eosinophil recruitment and activation.
   Conclusion: IL-16, TARC, and periostin distinguish between patients with
   AERD and those with ARwA. These mediators, taken together rather than
   individually, may comprise good specific nasal markers in patients with
   AERD. The effects of IL-16 and TARC on TH1, TH2, and T-regulatory cell
   functions in AERD cannot be disregarded. (C) 2016 American College of

Abstract = {The failure to achieve fisheries management objectives has been broadly
   discussed in international meetings. Measuring the effects of fishery
   regulations is difficult due to the lack of detailed information. The
   yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean offers an
   opportunity to evaluate the fishers' responses to temporal regulations.
   We used data from observers on-board Mexican purse-seine fleet, which is
   the main fleet fishing on dolphin-associated tuna schools. In 2002, the
   Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission implemented a closed season to
   reduce fishing effort for this fishery. For the period 1992-2008, we
   analysed three fishery indicators using generalized estimating equations
   to evaluate the fishers' response to the closure. We found that
   purse-seiners decreased their time spent in port, increased their
   fishing sets, and maintained their proportion of successful fishing
   sets. Our results highlight the relevance of accounting for the fisher
   behaviour to understand fisheries dynamics when establishing management
   regulations.},

Title = {Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium
   pseudocladosporioides as potential new fungal antagonists of
   Puccinia horiana Henn., the causal agent of chrysanthemum
   white rust},

Abstract = {Puccinia horiana Hennings, the causal agent of chrysanthemum white rust,
   is a worldwide quarantine organism and one of the most important fungal
   pathogens of Chrysanthemum x morifolium cultivars, which are used for
   cut flowers and as potted plants in commercial production regions of the
   world. It was previously reported to be controlled by Lecanicillium
   lecanii, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, C. uredinicola and Aphanocladium
   album, due to their antagonistic and hyperparasitic effects. We report
   novel antagonist species on Puccinia horiana. Fungi isolated from rust
   pustules in a commercial greenhouse from Villa Guerrero, Mexico, were
   identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium
   pseudocladosporioides based upon molecular analysis and morphological
   characters. The antagonism of C. cladosporioides and C.
   pseudocladosporioides on chrysanthemum white rust was studied using
   light and electron microscopy in vitro at the host/parasite interface.
   Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. pseudocladosporioides grew towards
   the white rust teliospores and colonized the sporogenous cells, but no
   direct penetration of teliospores was observed; however, the structure
   and cytoplasm of teliospores were altered. The two Cladosporium spp.
   were able to grow on media containing laminarin, but not when chitin was
   used as the sole carbon source; these results suggest that they are able
   to produce glucanases. Results from the study indicate that both
   Cladosporium species had potential as biological control agents of
   chrysanthemum white rust.},

Title = {Trends of the World Input and Output Network of Global Trade},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {The international trade naturally maps onto a complex networks.
   Theoretical analysis of this network gives valuable insights about the
   global economic system. Although different economic data sets have been
   investigated from the network perspective, little attention has been
   paid to its dynamical behaviour. Here we take the World Input Output
   Data set, which has values of the annual transactions between 40
   different countries of 35 different sectors for the period of 15 years,
   and infer the time interdependence between countries and sectors. As a
   measure of interdependence we use correlations between various time
   series of the network characteristics. First we form 15 primary networks
   for each year of the data we have, where nodes are countries and links
   are annual exports from one country to the other. Then we calculate the
   strengths (weighted degree) and PageRank of each country in each of the
   15 networks for 15 different years. This leads to sets of time series
   and by calculating the correlations between these we form a secondary
   network where the links are the positive correlations between different
   countries or sectors. Furthermore, we also form a secondary network
   where the links are negative correlations in order to study the
   competition between countries and sectors. By analysing this secondary
   network we obtain a clearer picture of the mutual influences between
   countries. As one might expect, we find that political and geographical
   circumstances play an important role. However, the derived correlation
   network reveals surprising aspects which are hidden in the primary
   network. Sometimes countries which belong to the same community in the
   original network are found to be competitors in the secondary networks.
   E.g. Spain and Portugal are always in the same trade flow community,
   nevertheless secondary network analysis reveal that they exhibit
   contrary time evolution.},

Title = {An analytical review of Halffter's Mexican transition zone, and its
   relevance for evolutionary biogeography, ecology and biogeographical
   regionalization},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4226},

Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {The Mexican transition zone (MTZ) is the complex area where the
   Neotropical and Nearctic biotas overlap, including south-western United
   States, Mexico and a large part of Central America extending to the
   Nicaraguan lowlands. In a strict sense, it corresponds to the mountain
   highlands of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. We
   review Halffter's theory explaining the biotic evolution of the MTZ,
   including the description and discussion of the distributional patterns
   and cenocrons recognized within it. Distributional patterns are
   generalizations that help analyse and compare distributions of different
   taxa. Cenocrons correspond to sets of taxa that share the same
   biogeographic history, constituting identifiable subsets within the
   transitional biota by their common biotic origin and evolutionary
   history. The heuristic value of distributional patterns and cenocrons
   lies in their application to formulate hypotheses on biotic assembly in
   the geographical-ecological space, to analyse the ecological response to
   anthropic impact, to analyse altitudinal patterns and to undertake
   time-slicing in cladistic biogeography. Three case studies are analysed
   with some detail: the Neotropical genus Canthon and the tribe Phanaeini
   and the Holarctic/Nearctic subfamily Geotrupinae. The Paleoamerican and
   Mexican Plateau cenocrons define the approximate boundaries of the MTZ,
   whereas the Mountain Mesoamerican, Nearctic and Typical Neotropical
   cenocrons correspond to the more conventional boundaries of the Nearctic
   and Neotropical regions. The biotic assembly of the MTZ is summarized
   into five stages: in the Jurassic-Cretaceous, the Paleoamerican cenocron
   (later diversified into five varieties) extended in Mexico; in the Late
   Cretaceous-Palaeocene, the Mexican Plateau cenocron dispersed from South
   America; in the Oligocene-Miocene, the Mountain Mesoamerican cenocron
   dispersed from the Central American Nucleus; in the Miocene-Pliocene,
   the Nearctic cenocron dispersed from northern North America; and in the
   Pleistocene, the Typical Neotropical cenocron dispersed from South
   America. Finally, we review the impact of Halffter's MTZ, with
   particular reference to dispersal, track, cladistic biogeographic,
   endemicity and phylogeographic analyses, as well as biogeographic
   regionalization.},

Abstract = {A new experimental technique for creating and imaging collisions of
   micron-sized droplets settling under gravity is presented. A pair of
   glycerol droplets is suspended in air by means of two optical traps. The
   droplet relative velocities are determined by the droplet sizes. The
   impact parameter is precisely controlled by positioning the droplets
   using the two optical traps. The droplets are released by turning o ff
   the trapping light using electro-optical modulators. The motion of the
   sedimenting droplets is then captured by two synchronized high-speed
   cameras, at a frame rate of up to 63 kHz. The method allows the direct
   imaging of the collision of droplets without the influence of the
   optical confinement imposed by the trapping force. The method will
   facilitate e ffi cient studies of the microphysics of neutral, as well
   as charged, liquid droplets and their interactions with light, electric
   field and thermodynamic environment, such as temperature or vapor
   concentration. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America},

Title = {Traditional use and perception of snakes by the Nahuas from Cuetzalan
   del Progreso, Puebla, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Background: Indigenous cultures are the result of their adaptation to
   the natural surroundings, in such a way that, amongst their main
   features is a set of knowledge, technologies and strategies for the
   appropriation of nature. In Cuetzalan del Progreso, Puebla, Mexico
   snakes represent 71.1\% of the total local herpetofauna; and in addition
   to this, different groups of Nahuas have shown to have information of
   their use of various snake species in many ways. This study was
   conducted to investigate the traditional uses of snakes in this cultural
   group.
   Methods: Formal and informal interviews were conducted with the
   inhabitants of the communities. During these interviews, 30 images of
   the different species of snakes present in the area were presented to
   the subjects, so that they would recognize them and reveal information
   about the knowledge they possess on them. A usage analysis was applied
   to each species considering the following categories: food purposes,
   medicinal, artisanal and magical-religious. Likewise, the frequency, the
   diversity and the value of use was estimated for these snakes.
   Results: A total of 51 interviews were carried out. The individuals
   recognized 18 out of 30 images of snakes that were presented. The total
   of usage categories was five; we found that the magic-religious use was
   the most mentioned by 32 personas. Boa imperator and Antropoides
   nummifer were the species with the highest value of use. More than half
   of the interviewees mentioned killing snakes because they're poisonous
   and aggressive. In the magic-religious aspect the ``Danza de los
   Negritos{''} is highlighted; this is a local festival, brought by
   Africans, and alludes to snakes.
   Conclusions: This study revealed that snakes are still very important
   for the culture in Cuetzalan del Progreso, finding that the
   magical-religious and the medicinal use stand out. On the other hand,
   the fear and misperception on the toxicity of snakes might represent a
   potential threat for their conservation. Therefore, it is necessary to
   carry out a long-term monitoring of the ethno-zoological activities, and
   develop a sustainable management plan compatible with the cultural
   characteristics of the natives of the region.},

Title = {A review of the flea genus Phalacropsylla Rothschild, 1915
   (Siphonaptera, Ctenophthalmidae, Neopsyllinae, Phalacropsyllini) with
   new host and distributional records},
Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {675},
Pages = {27-43},
Abstract = {A redescription of the genus Phalacropsylla Rothschild is provided. Six
   species are recognized: Phalacropsylla allos Wagner, P. hamata Tipton
   and Mendez, P. morlani Eads and Campos, P. nivalis Barrera and Traub, P.
   oregonensis Lewis and Maser, and P. paradisea Rothschild. Phalacropsylla
   hamata is designated herein as a junior synonym of P. paradisea. The
   distribution of P. paradisea is more extensive than previously thought,
   extending from Arizona through southern Colorado, into New Mexico,
   Texas, and northern Mexico (State of Nuevo Leon). It is the least
   host-specific of all species of Phalacropsylla, occurring on 13
   different host species including cricetid, heteromyid, murid, and
   sciurid rodents and several carnivores, although it most commonly occurs
   on Neotoma albigula Hartley. The range of P. oregonensis is expanded
   from eastern Oregon to southeastern Idaho. Numerous records are
   documented for the most common and ubiquitous species, P. allos, which
   is found in British Columbia, central to northern California, Idaho,
   Montana, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico.
   Neotoma cinerea Ord is the principal host of P. allos. Phalacropsylla
   allos is a winter flea west of the Rocky Mountains, but it has been
   reported in warmer months of the year on the eastern slopes of the Rocky
   Mountains in Larimer County, Colorado. A distribution map and key are
   provided for all species in the genus Phalacropsylla.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL BIOLOGY},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Osteopathy from derived hadrosauroids has been extensively studied.
   However, little work has been done in the basal members of this group.
   Only two brief notes have recorded three examples of osteopathy in the
   basal hadrosauroids in Bactrosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus and Jeyawati. In the
   present manuscript, we found in the holotype of the basal hadrosauroid
   Huehuecanauhtlus tiquichensis (IGM 6253) from Mexico two dorsal ribs and
   a dorsal vertebra with unusual pathologic conditions. The injuries are
   described as possible premortem or perimortem anterior rib fracture,
   associated with a singular sclerosis and costo-vertebral ankyloses which
   probably originated by spinal and rib osteomyelitis. The vertebral
   lesion caused direct damage to the nervous system and possible back
   pain. This study represents the first study of palaeopathology in a
   Mexican hadrosauroid in which the bone abnormalities are extensively
   compared with previous studies and described in detail, their origins
   are interpreted, and the health implications for the individual are
   considered.},

Title = {Clavulina-Membranomyces is the most important lineage within the
   highly diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal community of Abies
   religiosa},
Journal = {MYCORRHIZA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {53-65},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Abies religiosa is an endemic conifer of Mexico, where its monodominant
   forests are the winter refuge of the monarch butterfly. Due to climate
   change, it has been estimated that by 2090, A. religiosa populations
   will decline by 96.5 \%. To achieve success, reforestation programs
   should consider its ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We used ITS nrDNA
   sequences to identify the ECM fungi associated with A. religiosa and,
   based on its abundance and frequency, determined the diversity and
   community structure in a pure A. religiosa forest near Mexico City.
   Using sequence metadata, we inferred the species geographic distribution
   and host preferences. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of the
   Clavulinaceae (the most important family). The ECM community held 83
   species, among which the richest genera were Inocybe (21 species),
   Tomentella (10 species), and Russula (8 species). Besides its low
   species richness, the Clavulina-Membranomyces lineage was the most
   dominant family. Clavulina cf. cinerea and Membranomyces sp. exhibited
   the highest relative abundance and relative frequency values.
   Phylogenetic analyses placed the Clavulinaceae genotypes in three
   different clades: one within Membranomyces and two within Clavulina. A
   meta-analysis showed that the majority of the ECM fungi (45.78 \%)
   associated with A. religiosa in Mexico have also been sequenced from
   North America and are shared by Pinaceae and Fagaceae. In contrast,
   because they have not been sequenced previously, 32.2 \% of the species
   have a restricted distribution. Here, we highlight the emerging pattern
   that the Clavulina-Membranomyces lineage is dominant in several ECM
   communities in the Neotropics, including Aldinia and Dicymbe legume
   tropical forests in the Guyana Shield, the Alnus acuminata subtropical
   communities, and the A. religiosa temperate forests in Mexico.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To understand the functional meaning of morphological features, we need
   to relate what we know about morphology and ecology in a meaningful,
   quantitative framework. Closely related species usually share more
   phenotypic features than distant ones, but close relatives do not
   necessarily have the same ecologies. Rodents are the most diverse group
   of living mammals, with impressive ecomorphological diversification. We
   used museum collections and ecological literature to gather data on
   morphology, diet and locomotion for 208 species of rodents from
   different bioregions to investigate how morphological similarity and
   phylogenetic relatedness are associated with ecology. After considering
   differences in body size and shared evolutionary history, we find that
   unrelated species with similar ecologies can be characterized by a
   well-defined suite of morphological features. Our results validate the
   hypothesized ecological relevance of the chosen traits. These cranial,
   dental and external (e.g. ears) characters predicted diet and locomotion
   and showed consistent differences among species with different feeding
   and substrate use strategies. We conclude that when ecological
   characters do not show strong phylogenetic patterns, we cannot simply
   assume that close relatives are ecologically similar. Museum specimens
   are valuable records of species' phenotypes and with the characters
   proposed here, morphology can reflect functional similarity, an
   important component of community ecology and macroevolution.},

Volume = {110},

Abstract = {Development of accurate systems to assess academic research performance
   is an essential topic in national science agendas around the world.
   Providing quantitative elements such as scientometric rankings and
   indicators have contributed to measure prestige and excellence of
   universities, but more sophisticated computational tools are seldom
   exploited. We compare the evolution of Mexican scientific production in
   Scopus and the Web of Science as well as Mexico's scientific
   productivity in relation to the growth of the National Researchers
   System of Mexico is analyzed. As a main analysis tool we introduce an
   artificial intelligence procedure based on self-organizing neural
   networks. The neural network technique proves to be a worthy
   scientometric data mining and visualization tool which automatically
   carries out multiparametric scientometric characterizations of the
   production profiles of the 50 most productive Mexican Higher Education
   Institutions (in Scopus database). With this procedure we automatically
   identify and visually depict clusters of institutions that share similar
   bibliometric profiles in bidimensional maps. Four perspectives were
   represented in scientometric maps: productivity, impact, expected
   visibility and excellence. Since each cluster of institutions represents
   a bibliometric pattern of institutional performance, the neural network
   helps locate various bibliometric profiles of academic production, and
   the identification of groups of institutions which have similar patterns
   of performance. Also, scientometric maps allow for the identification of
   atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with
   classical tools, since they outstand not because of a disparate value in
   just one variable, but due to an uncommon combination of a set of
   indicators values.},

Title = {Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin regularity for the Hodge decomposition and

Abstract = {The Hodge decomposition is a fundamental result in the theory of
   differential forms. It has been extensively studied from different
   perspectives and it is the source of several applications in physics and
   mathematics. For example, it is important in the analysis of
   Navier-Stokes' and Maxwell's equations, it can be used to prove results
   on inverse scattering problems in quantum mechanics and it is useful for
   the study of magnetic potentials associated to a magnetic field. The
   regularity properties of the Hodge decomposition have been studied in
   several works in the last decades, most prominently it has been proved
   that Sobolev regularity holds true. In this paper we prove regularity
   for the Hodge decomposition in a much larger scale of function spaces:
   Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on compact Riemannian manifolds with
   boundary. We prove regularity in such spaces for the Hodge-Morrey
   decomposition and the Hodge-Morrey-Friedrichs decomposition. We,
   furthermore, state and prove a refinement for the
   Hodge-Morrey-Friedrichs decomposition (with regularity) that allows
   expressing every differential form as the sum of the differential of a
   form plus the co-differential of another form plus a harmonic field
   belonging to a finite dimensional space. This holds true even if the
   original form is barely differentiable (with sth order of
   differentiability, for every real number s > 0). We finally provide an
   application to the study of magnetic potentials associated to magnetic
   fields. More precisely, we prove the existence of a magnetic potential
   associated to a magnetic field. The former being one time more
   differentiable than the latter, in terms of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin
   regularity. This is an important motivation for us, since we have the
   intention to apply our results to further investigations in relativistic
   inverse (time dependent) scattering problems in quantum mechanics, where
   Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin regularity for magnetic potentials is
   relevant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We focus on dynamical descriptions of short-term synaptic plasticity.
   Instead of focusing on the molecular machinery that has been reviewed
   recently by several authors, we concentrate on the dynamics and
   functional significance of synaptic plasticity, and review some
   mathematical models that reproduce different properties of the dynamics
   of short term synaptic plasticity that have been observed
   experimentally. The complexity and shortcomings of these models point to
   the need of simple, yet physiologically meaningful models. We propose a
   simplified model to be tested in synapses displaying different types of
   short-term plasticity.},

Title = {Landscape-scale effects of geomorphological heterogeneity on variability
   of oak forest structure and composition in a monogenetic volcanic field},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {167-174},
Abstract = {Background: Eruptive events in monogenetic volcanic fields create
   mosaics of lava fields that result in different successional times and
   stages, and environmental conditions. Such geomorphological
   heterogeneity may be related to patterns of vegetation structure,
   diversity, and composition across a landscape.
   Aims: To examine landscape-scale effects of geomorphological
   heterogeneity on the spatial variability of oak forest structure and
   composition in a monogenetic volcanic field.
   Methods: We sampled oak forests in six geomorphological units within a
   monogenetic volcanic field in El Tepozteco National Park and carried out
   redundancy analyses to relate environmental variables to forest
   composition and structure.
   Results: Geomorphological heterogeneity explained 28.8 and 25.7\% of the
   variation in canopy structure and composition, respectively, and 21.6\%
   of the variation in understorey composition. Exposed rock was the most
   important predictor of understorey composition and canopy structure,
   while elevation was a better predictor of canopy composition. The role
   of chronic human disturbance as a driver of forest composition and
   structure was minor compared to that of geomorphological heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: The geomorphological heterogeneity created by volcanic
   activity in this landscape drives oak forest variability; however,
   considerable unexplained variation in vegetation traits remains, which
   could be associated with unmeasured dimensions of environmental
   heterogeneity, neutral processes, and the effects of long-term human
   activity in the area.},

   basin, Mexico City},
Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background. Reproductive phenology studies in temperate forests of
   Mexico are scarce and none of them takes into account
   micro-environmental factors. As an example, there are no studies of the
   reproductive dynamics of Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis, the
   elderberry.
   Questions. How do environmental factors, at general and micro-scales are
   related to the production of flowers and fruits of Sambucus nigra subsp.
   canadensis?
   Study species. Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis is distributed in Abies
   religiosa (fir) forests of Mexico and it is associated to areas of
   anthropogenic disturbance.
   Study site and dates. Temperate forest in the Magdalena river basin,
   April 2012 to May 2013. Methods. The percentages of flowers and fruits
   of 103 individuals were registered and precipitation, temperature, light
   and soil chemical properties were characterized as well. To find out the
   relation between reproductive phenology and the environmental factors we
   carried out Spearman's correlations as well as a Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis for the micro-environmental factors.
   Results. Percentages of flowers and fruits showed a relation with the
   general factors of precipitation, temperature and light. In the
   micro-environments with the highest light amounts the percentages of
   fruits were the highest, while the microenvironments with the highest
   nitrogen, organic matter concentrations and soil moisture, showed the
   highest flower percentages.
   Conclusions. We showed that general factors as well as
   micro-environmental ones have an influence on the proportions of flowers
   and fruits of the study species in different ways, these knowledges show
   the reproductive dynamics of this species.},

   The case of the xate palm in the Lacandon Jungle, Mexico},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) can create development
   opportunities for local populations, but this requires certain
   conditions. In Mexico, the use of NTFP considered by the government to
   be ``at risk{''} is regulated by ``wildlife conservation management
   units{''} (UMAs), a policy instrument that seeks to reconcile biological
   conservation with local development. Its effectiveness varies according
   to the context in which the instrument is applied. The majority of UMAs
   in the south of the Mexico, particularly for NTFPs, have shown less than
   encouraging results, partly because their design and implementation do
   not takntry. Based oe into account the complexity and diversity of the
   conditions present in rural areas in this part of the coun ethnographic
   observation, in-depth interviews, and socioeconomic surveys, this
   article analyzes the implementation of a palm (palma camedor) UMA in two
   rural villages in the Lacandon rain forest in Chiapas, Mexico. We argue
   that these palm UMAs assume a simplified conception of the complex
   reality of these communities, in which the implementation of the
   management instrument alters the local balance of power. Its
   bureaucratic design and overregulating character generates
   discretionality, simulation, and corruption, which in turn accentuates
   exclusions and favors local elites.},

Title = {Geoelectrical and Electromagnetic Methods Applied to Paleolimnological
   Studies: Two Examples from Desiccated Lakes in the Basin of Mexico},

Abstract = {Paleolimnological studies require a broad understanding of the geometry
   and depth of the sedimentary fill of lake basins prior to coring
   campaigns. Seismic methods are routinely employed for the indirect
   characterization of lake-bottom sediments. However, the use of seismic
   methods might occasionally be limited due to surface conditions or poor
   seismic contrasts between the stratigraphic units, which lead to data
   quality that is too poor to provide sufficient information for the
   selection of drill sites. Sources of cultural noise are one of the main
   reasons why seismic methods fail in study areas near or within large
   cities, such as Mexico City. Under certain conditions, electrical and
   electromagnetic methods might be a suitable substitute or complement to
   seismic exploration, as they respond to different physical properties of
   the subsurface. To evaluate the applicability of such methods, here we
   present two recent case studies from the desiccated lakes Chalco and
   Xochimilco both located in urban areas within the Basin of Mexico where
   electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), transient electromagnetic (TEM)
   and magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were conducted for the
   characterization of lake basement and lacustrine sediments. In both
   examples, the results of the geophysical exploration contributed
   valuable stratigraphic information for the following drilling and core
   recovery, which highlights the potential of electrical and
   electromagnetic methods in paleolimnological studies.},

Abstract = {Two lahar episodes that occurred at Colima and Popocatepetl volcanoes
   (Mexico) are modeled using the FLO2D code, with the scope to define the
   parameters that control flow simulation and their reliability. The Lahar
   Patrio at Volcan de Colima was used to evaluate the model performance
   related to the influence of input hydrograph shape and Manning-n value
   in the absence of real data. The Popocatepetl 2001 lahar was used to
   evaluate the model response to lahars with different rheologic
   behaviors. Input parameters for lahar modeling like hydrograph,
   Manning-n values, and rheologic coefficients were derived from geophone
   data, channel geometry, and textural characteristics of the deposits. To
   validate the Lahar Patrio simulation, three parameters were used: the
   percent length ratio, the fitness function, and flow depths. This
   approach shows that a simplified hydrograph can be a good approximation
   for lahar simulation. On the contrary, Manning-n coefficient has a
   stronger influence on simulation results. The greatest uncertainty in
   lahar modeling with FLO2D is the selection of rheologic coefficients
   since very little changes in their magnitude can affect the simulation
   results. When a proper assessment of these input parameter uncertainties
   are performed, results obtained with FLO2D can be very useful for lahar
   hazard evaluation.},

Abstract = {Under the premise that all behaviors in nature have a quantum
   explanation, we would like to wonder if the biological memory also
   possesses a quantum explanation. In this work we investigate the
   possibility to obtain some quantum signatures that we can recognize in
   processes involved in the codification of data in neurons. For this
   purpose, we propose to use the optical criteria in order to distinguish
   classical and quantum time series of photon signals. Taken into account
   that a neuroscientist locates the memory in the synapse con figuration,
   we conjecture that neuronal network could be more efficient if the
   neuronal network functioning was considered a quantum system.},

   cyanotoxins, their causes, and acknowledge the need for knowledge about
   them in order to implement measures that will reduce their negative
   effects. Methods. We present a review of several studies encompassing
   historical aspects and incorporating the first studies into the current
   context, in order to enumerate the most frequent cyanotoxins in inland
   water. Results. We discuss the symptoms that cyanotoxins cause in
   vertebrates, as well as reference levels to avoid intoxication by

Abstract = {The morphological and environmental characteristics of the genus
   Terpsinoe were assessed from five populations from tropical streams in
   central Mexico. Four populations of Terpsinoe musica were characterized
   by one eccentric rimoportula with a short stalk. Only one population was
   characterized by one to three eccentric rimoportulae. For the first time
   the external process known as a rota is described for this genus, a
   taxonomic character employed to differentiate genera and species in
   other members of the Biddulphiaceae. Populations of T. musica occurred
   in warm freshwater habitats (20-29 degrees C), neutral to slightly
   alkaline waters (pH 7-8), with medium to high ionic content (specific
   conductance 268-2640Scm(-1)) and dominance of sulphate/bicarbonate and
   calcium/magnesium. Highest abundances occurred in microhabitats at
   shallow depths, with variable water flux, low to medium irradiance on
   the bedrock, suggesting that T. musica is an abundant fresh hard-water
   species, even though it could be found over a wide range of conditions.
   The morphological analysis identified all the studied populations as T.
   musica. However, the morphological and morphometric variation found in
   these populations suggests ecophenotypic variation, broadening the
   taxonomic characteristics of this species.},

Abstract = {Rivers in large cities face management problems that could be addressed
   through the integration of scientific and local ecological knowledge.
   The objective of this article is to emphasize the importance of
   different sources of knowledge in management alternatives for periurban
   watersheds. Specifically, this is done through (a) use of oral sources
   and archives to document the historic relationship between local
   residents and their natural resources, and (b) technical evaluation of
   the quantity and quality of water in the sub-basin through the time. We
   analyzed, through the 19 unstructured interviews, local residents'
   knowledge related to water quantity and quality. Additionally, we
   analyzed historical river flow data and water quality reports. The
   results show that the relationship between the local inhabitants and the
   river has been governed by public policies of both exploitation and
   conservation. For the last century, the river was used as the main
   source of electric power for local industry, the collapse of which, led
   to the decline of the importance of the river in the perception of the
   locals. Analysis of historical river flow data reveals a slight decrease
   in flow despite a trend of somewhat lower precipitation. This
   discrepancy may be due to hydraulic infrastructure construction and
   uncontrolled extraction. We conclude that the integration of two kinds
   of knowledge present a great opportunity to test a monitoring system
   that incorporates the environmental features that were more accurately
   described by the local residents: water quantity and forest land use.},

Abstract = {The LOOK-COMPUTE-MOVE model for a set of autonomous robots has been
   thoroughly studied for over two decades. Each robot repeatedly LOOKS at
   its surroundings and obtains a snapshot containing the positions of all
   robots; based on this information, the robot COMPUTES a destination and
   then MOVES to it. Previous work assumed all robots are present at the
   beginning of the computation. What would be the effect of robots
   appearing asynchronously? This paper studies this question, for problems
   of bringing the robots close together, and exposes an intimate
   connection with combinatorial topology.
   A central problem in the mobile robots area is the gathering problem. In
   its discrete version, the robots start at vertices in some graph G known
   to them, move towards the same vertex and stop. The paper shows that if
   robots are asynchronous and may crash, then gathering is impossible for
   any graph G with at least two vertices, even if robots can have unique
   IDs, remember the past, know the same names for the vertices of G and
   use an arbitrary number of lights to communicate with each other.
   Next, the paper studies two weaker variants of gathering: edge gathering
   and 1-gathering. For both problems we present possibility and
   impossibility results. The solvability of edge gathering is fully
   characterized: it is solvable for three or more robots on a given graph
   if and only if the graph is acyclic.
   Finally, general robot tasks in a graph are considered. A combinatorial
   topology characterization for the solvable tasks is presented, by a
   reduction of the asynchronous fault-tolerant LOOK-COMPUTE-MOVE model to
   a wait-free read/write shared-memory computing model, bringing together
   two areas that have been independently studied for a long time into a
   common theoretical foundation.},

Abstract = {The characterization of has been active region of the corona discharge,
   it is critical and important for several applications. In this work, it
   investigated an air discharge at atmospheric pressure between a needle
   electrode and a flat metal cathode, as well as between a needle
   electrode and a cathode immersed in water. The voltage and current of
   the plasma discharge were analyzed; the power used was of 14 kW. The air
   discharge was analyzed by optical emission spectroscopy (OES), using a
   spectrometer (Model HR2000CG-UV-NIR). The optical emission spectroscopy
   were measured in the UV-visible-NIR wavelength range between 200 nm and
   1100 nm, in order to identify the excited species formed in a corona air
   discharge. The species observed were: NO transitions A(2)Pi -> X-2 Pi at
   222.2, 272.2 nm; NH transition, A(3)Pi -> X-3 Sigma(g) at 336.1 nm;
   N-2(+) transitions B-2 Sigma(u) -> X-2 Sigma(g) at 391.4, 423.7, 427.8
   and 495.73 nm; N-2(+) at 567.95 and 593.17 nm; O at 777.1, 844.6 and
   869.56 nm; H2O at 618.8 and 657.8 nm The electron temperature (T-e) and
   electron density (n(e)) were evaluated using the Boltzmann and Saha
   equations, they were found to be 7.07 eV and 2.43 x 10 15 cm(-3)

Volume = {105},

Abstract = {The class Dacrymycetes has been considered a monophyletic group based on
   shared morphological characteristics and recent molecular studies, with
   bifurcate basidia and non perforate parenthosome as synapomorphies. In
   this review of the state of knowledge for Dacrymycetes (dacrymycetoid
   fungi) in Mexico, a detailed survey of the literature revealed 21
   species in eight genera in Mexico; 20 belong to seven genera of
   Dacrymycetaceae and one species belongs to the Cerinomycetaceae. The
   best-represented genus is Dacrymyces, and the most-recorded species is
   Daciyopinax spathularia. Taxa of Dacrymycetes in Mexico have been
   recorded from 22 states, mainly those located in central Mexico. The
   members of this group recorded in Mexico are, apparently,
   wood-decomposers and have been most frequently collected during the wet
   season (end of May to beginning of October), but they can be found
   throughout the year. From the review, it is evident that systematic and
   biogeographic knowledge on the Dacrymycetes in Mexico is scarce. Thus,
   more extensive sampling and detailed systematic and molecular studies
   are needed.},

Volume = {136},
Pages = {39-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seagrasses are marine angiosperms that have evolved from terrestrial
   ancestors. Photosynthetic activity on seed has been studied before in
   Posidonia genus. T. testudinum and P. oceanica share some evolutionary
   aspects as they live in more stable environments. As in P. oceanica, T.
   testudinim seed is also green-coloured suggesting the presence of
   photosynthetic pigments. Here, the photosynthetic activity in the T.
   testudinum seed was examined. Measurements of photosynthetic production,
   pigment content and maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv: Fm) were
   determined. Epifluorescence microscopy analysis was used to obtain
   evidence of photosynthetic structures within the seed. This study
   revealed photosynthetic activity in seed epidermis which increased
   linearly with increasing irradiance. T. testudinum seed displayed a
   higher Photosynthetic efficiency (alpha), and lower light saturated
   photosynthesis (P. max), saturation irradiance (Ek), and compensation
   irradiance (Ec) compared to adult leaves. Epifluorescence microscopy
   images of the seeds showed an epidermis composed of relatively small,
   regular cells, tending towards a rectangular shape, containing abundant
   chloroplasts. The photobiological behaviour results in the T. testudinum
   seed being strongly adapted to colonize environments with reduced light
   availability. Photosynthetic activity in T. testudinum seed shed some
   light on seagrass dispersal and expansion mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Genetic concepts around DNA replication, transcription and translation
   are widely mentioned through the media and in everyday language,
   however, high school students consider them abstract, complex and
   difficult to understand why they try to formulate explanations based on
   information that they have acquired outside of school. In this sense,
   their participation in the scientific field is very limited to zero,
   largely due to the traditional teaching model which does not allow
   students move beyond declarative knowledge without comprehension.
   The present work is based on the approach of situated teaching, whose
   purpose is to change the dynamics prevailing in classrooms and achieve a
   true education for life. For this, the teaching-learning strategy was
   used based on the case study which was designed with the aim of
   promoting both the learning of the afore mentioned subjects, as well as
   of procedural and attitudinal contents that together give the student
   knowledge that you can transfer and use in your daily life.
   Our results shown:
   a) the cases of study proposed generated interest, dilemmas and
   controversies, which favored individual work, in team and group;
   b) the multiple choice test shows that the students achieved to be
   appropriate in a statistically significant way of the genetic concepts
   studied;
   c) the open-ended questionnaire gives evidence that the strategy
   promotes incorporation of the fundamental concepts of the subject, so
   that the students achieve formulate high-level responses to complex
   issues;
   d) students were able to explain the processes of DNA replication,
   transcription and translation through the elaboration and collaborative
   work, also highlighted the importance of processes and understood that
   DNA has the ability to replicate its information and translate it to
   translate into protein; and
   e) the analysis and discussion of cases allowed the application of
   genetic concepts for the understanding of problem situations and favored
   the establishment of arguments and conclusions based on knowledge
   decision-making in the face of a problem, developing critical thinking,
   the expression of emotions and values. In conclusion, the
   teaching-learning based on the case study is a viable didactic tool
   which promotes meaningful learning of the conceptual, procedural and
   attitudinal significant learning.},

Title = {Dirac fields in flat FLRW cosmology: Uniqueness of the Fock quantization},
Journal = {ANNALS OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {376},
Pages = {76-88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We address the issue of the infinite ambiguity that affects the
   construction of a Fock quantization of a Dirac field propagating in a
   cosmological spacetime with flat compact sections. In particular, we
   discuss a physical criterion that restricts to a unique possibility (up
   to unitary equivalence) the infinite set of available vacua. We prove
   that this desired uniqueness is guaranteed, for any possible choice of
   spin structure on the spatial sections, if we impose two conditions. The
   first one is that the symmetries of the classical system must be
   implemented quantum mechanically, so that the vacuum is invariant under
   the symmetry transformations. The second and more important condition is
   that the constructed theory must have a quantum dynamics that is
   implementable as a (non-trivial) unitary operator in Fock space.
   Actually, this unitarity of the quantum dynamics leads us to identify as
   explicitly time dependent some very specific contributions of the Dirac
   field. In doing that, we essentially characterize the part of the
   dynamics governed by the Dirac equation that is unitarily implementable.
   The uniqueness of the Fock vacuum is attained then once a physically
   motivated convention for the concepts of particles and antiparticles is
   fixed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The social feather duster worm Bispira brunnea (Polychaeta:
   Sabellidae): aggregations, morphology and reproduction},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Pages = {782-796},
Abstract = {The fan worm Bispira brunnea is one of the most attractive sabellid
   polychaetes from Caribbean coral reef areas and it is exploited for
   ornamental purposes. An understanding of the structure of its
   aggregations, morphology and reproductive biology will provide
   information required to facilitate artificial propagation of this
   species. Ten aggregations were collected in October 2013, February and
   March 2014 in the Majahual reef lagoon, Mexican Caribbean. Whole
   aggregations were examined under light microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy and the histology of oogenesis was determined. Aggregations
   were composed of 24-56 individuals and included juveniles and adults.
   The adults (5-20 mm) did not display any noticeable form of sexual
   dimorphism. In B. brunnea both sexual (hermaphroditism or gonochorism)
   and asexual reproduction occurred at the same time within the
   population: 92.71\% reproduced sexually and 52\% by architomy. The buds
   produced by architomy were inside the parental tube, at three
   regenerative stages. The sex ratio was 36.75\% males, 33.11\% females,
   22.84\% hermaphrodites and 7.28\% unknown (gametes not seen). Gametes
   were distributed in the last thoracic segments and throughout the
   abdomen. Oogenesis was extra-ovarian, development followed four discrete
   stages and the oocytes were small and asynchronous (60.97 mu m in
   diameter). Sperm morphology was adapted to external fertilization in the
   water column. Sequential (protandrous) hermaphroditism is suggested to
   occur in B. brunnea. The pyramidellid ectosymbiont mollusc Odostomia
   (Eulimastoma) caniculatum is recorded here for the first time as being
   associated with a sabellid worm.},

Title = {Community structure of fern-affiliated endophytes in three neotropical
   forests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {From the saprotrophs that decay plant material to the pathogens and
   mutualists that shape plant demography at local and regional scales,
   fungi are major drivers of tropical forest dynamics. Although endophytic
   fungi are abundant and diverse in many biomes, they reach their greatest
   diversity in tropical forests, where they can influence plant
   physiology, performance and survival. The number of quantitative studies
   regarding endophytes has increased dramatically in the past two decades,
   but general rules have not yet emerged regarding the biogeography, host
   affiliations, local or regional distributions, or phylogenetic diversity
   of endophytes in most tropical settings. Here, endophytic fungal
   communities associated with 18 species of eupolypod fern were compared
   among forest reserves in Panama, Costa Rica and Mexico. Molecular
   sequence data for >2000 isolates were used to determine the
   relationships of host taxonomy, forest (site), and environmental
   dissimilarity to endophyte community composition. Communities in related
   ferns differed significantly among forests, reflecting the interplay of
   geographic distance and environmental dissimilarity. Although the same
   phyla and classes of fungi were prevalent at each site, they differed in
   relative abundance. All sites were dominated by the same order
   (Xylariales), but sites differed in the phylogenetic clustering vs.
   evenness of their endophyte communities. By addressing the relationship
   of endophyte communities to host taxonomy, geographic distance and
   environmental factors, this study complements previous work on
   angiosperms and contributes to a growing perspective on the factors
   shaping communities of ecologically important fungi in tropical forests.},

Title = {Daily activity pattern of reintroduced giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga

Journal = {MAMMALIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We assessed the effect of seasonality and intrinsic conditions on daily
   activity pattern of giant anteaters reintroduced in the Ibera Reserve,
   Argentina. During 2007-2012 we gathered 159 24-h focal samples on 15
   radio-marked individuals (11 captive-reared, four wild-reared; seven
   adults, eight juveniles), 216 records of beginning and end of activity
   bouts on 20 individuals, and 454 camera- traps records (3345 trap-days).
   We estimated the daily hours of activity, the percentage of diurnal and
   nocturnal activity, and the daily activity range and time overlap using
   time as a circular variable in kernel density estimations. We assessed
   differences between seasons, sexes, age classes, and types of rearing.
   The average daily hours of activity was 8: 43 h. Camera-traps and
   radio-telemetry showed similar results. Animals exhibited both diurnal
   (60-65\%) and nocturnal (40-35\%) activity. The higher probability for
   being active ranged within 09:00-03:00 h. Anteaters spent more hours
   active and were more nocturnal during summer. Activity was highly
   overlapped between sexes, and wild-reared individuals were more
   nocturnal than captive-reared ones. Seasonal shifts in daily activity
   highlights the importance of thermoregulation as a selective factor in
   this species. The giant anteater is a cathemeral species with
   flexibility to accommodate its activity pattern to local conditions or
   experience.},

Abstract = {Metric patent studies since the end of the last century are a valuable

   an indispensable instrument for knowing the international technological
   behavior. However, patentometric studies are not applied optimally by
   all countries or by all international organizations, nor are all the

   country's technological innovations. This research aims to analyze the
   metric behavior of patents granted in Cuba applying an own methodology
   that describes the main technological scientific innovations patented by
   the Cuban Office of Industrial Property. The proposed methodology uses
   proIntec software for the download, normalization, processing, analysis
   and visualization of data from patents, and applies a large group of
   relational and complex metrics, as well as social networking techniques
   to visualize the main behaviors of Cuban technological innovations. The
   final results show the potential of metric patent studies to represent
   the country's technological developments and its contributions to the

Abstract = {``The future is here{''} has been the very quote that has echoed across
   the media for many decades. Whether it be to announce the latest in
   cutting edge technology that benefits the population such as the
   automobile, the airplane, electricity, the phone, and most importantly,
   the computer. It has been seen time and time again where an innovation
   has changed the world in great ways to either connect people faster or
   to make our lives much easier. However, thanks to advances in computing
   and computer science, society has begun to find itself in front of an
   innovation expected to change the world which is known as automation.
   Automation has existed even before the industrial revolution and is used
   widely in many areas of manufacturing. It existed in the creation of the
   production line where a large machine could perform a repetitive action
   to help assemble products. This type of machinery has found many
   innovations of its own primarily that of running on electricity as
   opposed to steam and using computers to control it. Today, most electric
   machinery makes use of computers to program and control their movements
   for quick and precise movement allowing the miniaturization of many
   electronics with surface mount technology and the production of
   affordable cars. Since the beginning of these machines, many workers
   have found their choices for employment reduced, while the doors for
   other options have increased. This has been changing in recent years as
   computing and software has improved to lengths that new technologies
   such as machine learning have become more capable of even replacing
   workers in desk jobs with higher productivity. This is where a possible
   problem may arise. If machines were capable of learning and doing
   complex tasks, would the entire human workforce be obsolete? If such an
   event were to occur, how would it affect developing countries like
   Mexico? In this paper, we discuss the implications of future automation
   for developing countries who supply with cheap labor and export
   manufactured goods to the most powerful country on earth, the United
   States that will lead the automation race in the next years. The
   engineering curricula of different Mexican universities are reviewed to
   examine which ones will be better prepared for the upcoming automation
   wave. Each of these Mexican institutions, which teach engineering, have
   been created for distinct reasons with different histories. For the
   current times, it seems that all Mexican institutions focus on the same
   goal, which is not only to prepare students for a job, but to educate
   them for the next generation of discoveries and innovation. The
   curricula of these universities tell a different story.},

Title = {Pharmacological evaluation of the anxiolytic-like effects of Lippia
   graveolens and bioactive compounds},

Abstract = {Context: Lippia species (Verbenaceae) are widely used in Latin America
   and Africa as folk medicine for their tranquilizing properties.
   Objective: To evaluate the anxiolytic-like effects and safety of Lippia
   graveolens Kunth. by exploring its aqueous and organic leaf extracts and
   identifying the responsible chemical constituents.
   Material and methods: Aqueous and organic extracts (hexane, ethyl
   acetate and methanol) were pharmacologically evaluated at several doses.
   Chemical constituents were identified using MS, NMR and GC-MS analysis.
   The isolated compounds (3mg/kg, i.p.), extracts (1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg,
   i.p.), and the reference drug diazepam (0.1mg/kg, i.p.) were assessed in
   CD-1 mice using experimental behavioural models: open-field, cylinder,
   hole-board, plus-maze and sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis, as well
   as their acute toxicity (LD50).
   Results: After administration of the extracts and bioactive compounds, a
   significant anxiolytic-like response from 1 mg/kg, i.p. was observed,
   resembling the effect of diazepam. Major presence of thymol (33.40\%)
   was observed in the hexane extract; whereas for the first time in this
   species a p-cymene + thymol mixture (9.78\%), naringenin (0.18\%) and
   cirsimaritin (1.16\%) were obtained as bioactive constituents of the
   ethyl acetate crude extract. Acute toxicity was calculated to be LD50 =
   1000mg/kg for the crude hexane extract, lower in comparison to the other
   extracts analyzed (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg).
   yDiscussion and conclusion: Our results suggest that L. graveolens
   exerts anxiolytic-like activity involving many kinds of constituents,
   mainly of the terpenoid and flavonoid nature. These results reinforce
   the potential use of this species in the therapy of anxiety.},

Abstract = {The radiocarbon concentration is reduced in urban areas, generally due
   to high CO2 emissions derived from fossil fuels. In this paper, new
   Delta C-14 measurements in cellulose extracted from the growth rings of
   two trees over a 43-year period are presented. The first is in a zone
   with clean air (El Nayar, Durango, Mexico) and the second is from the
   Greater Mexico City area (Chapultepec). Data from El Nayar is consistent
   with that reported for Zone 2 of the Northern Hemisphere while that from
   the urban area shows a significant decrease in Delta C-14. Our results
   are compared with data from other cities (Nagoya, Japan and Valladolid,
   Spain). (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Synthesis of Bi25FeO39 by molten salts
   method and its mossbauer spectrum},
Journal = {PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {504},
Pages = {109-111},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {A sample of Bi25FeO39 was synthesized by the molten salts method in 2 h
   at 750 degrees C with KCl-KBr as reaction media. The sample was
   characterized with X-ray powder diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy.
   The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction confirms that a
   sillenite type structure with a cell parameter a=10.190(4) angstrom was
   achieved, with only small traces of Bi2O3. In order to get a Mossbauer
   spectrum with a good signal to noise ratio, the synthesis was made using
   95\% enriched alpha-57Fe(2)O(3). To our knowledge, this is the first
   time that a Mossbauer spectrum for the Bi25FeO39 has been recorded. The
   nonappearance of a magnetic sextet confirms its paramagnetic behavior.
   The measured Mossbauer parameters (IS=0.20 +/- 0.004 mm/s and QS=0.2 +/-
   0.07 mm/s) correspond to Fe+3 in very symmetric surroundings, and rule
   out some interpretations given to the doublet observed in some Mossbauer
   spectra of BiFeO3.},

Abstract = {Obesity is becoming a pandemic worldwide but the mechanisms that cause
   obesity are not well understood. One possibility are metabolic
   differences between lean and obese people, for which body temperature
   may offer a proxy which is relatively easy to measure. In the present
   contribution, we present results from two complementary methodological
   approaches to measure skin temperature as a function of body weight: in
   the first study temperature at the axilla and anthropometric measures
   were collected at a single time point in 1,073 male and female employees
   of all ages of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM),
   whereas in the second study a 1-week continuous monitoring was realized
   of the skin temperature of the non-dominant wrist of 22 male young
   adults. In spite of the methodological differences, both studies
   indicate a higher mean temperature of the obese with respect to the lean
   subjects, possibly reflecting how obese people offset excess calorie
   intake by a higher heat transfer to the environment. On the other hand,
   with respect to the variance of the temperature over groups of
   underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese subjects, the first
   study that was realized in controlled circumstances did not detect any
   differences between groups, whereas the differences that were detected
   in the second study probably indicate behavioural differences between
   groups such as the level of physical activity.},

Abstract = {The first natural chromosomal variation in the house mouse was described
   nearly 50 years ago in Val Poschiavo on the Swiss side of the
   Swiss-Italian border in the Central Eastern Alps. Studies have extended
   into neighboring Valtellina, and the house mice of the
   Poschiavo-Valtellina area have been subject to detailed analysis,
   reviewed here. The maximum extent of this area is 70 km, yet it has 4
   metacentric races and the standard 40-chromosome telocentric race
   distributed in a patchwork fashion. The metacentric races are
   characterized by highly reduced diploid numbers (2n = 22-26) resulting
   from Robertsonian fusions, perhaps modified by whole-arm reciprocal
   translocations. The races hybridize and the whole Poschiavo-Valtellina
   area can be considered a ``hybrid zone.{''} The studies of this area
   have provided insights into origin of races within hybrid zones, gene
   flow within hybrid zones and the possibility of speciation in hybrid
   zones. This provides a case study of how chromosomal rearrangements may
   impact the genetic structure of populations and their diversification.},

Title = {A palynological study and molecular analysis of the Desmodium
   procumbens group (Leguminosae-Papilionoideae) in Mexico},
Journal = {GRANA},

Volume = {56},

Pages = {174-186},
Abstract = {Desmodium diversity has been mainly classified using fruit characters,
   and because of variability in these and other characters, the taxonomy
   has sometimes been problematic and thus, there is a need for
   clarification and taxonomic reassessments. This is the case for the
   Desmodium procumbens group, where several infraspecific taxa have been
   named. The phylogenetic relationships among taxa referred to this group
   is unknown, and the taxonomic status has been recently revised only for
   some of the taxa. In this study, pollen morphology and ultrastructure of
   D. neomexicanum, D. procumbens var. procumbens, D. procumbens var.
   exiguum, D. procumbens var. longipes and D. procumbens var. transversum,
   belonging to the Mexican Desmodium procumbens group, were examined using
   light, phase-contrast, scanning electron and transmission electron
   microscopy, in order to establish palynological characters that might
   contribute to a better taxonomic resolution. Pollen grains are
   tricolporate, radiosymmetric, oblate spheroidal to prolate spheroidal
   shape, with lalongate endoapertures and rugulate exine with foveolae
   between rugulae. The exine is tectate with a columellate and/or
   granulate structure. The absence of a fastigium, features of exine
   sculpture, a colpus membrane and infrastructure mainly dominated by
   granules differentiate the pollen grains of the varieties exiguum and
   transversum from the other taxa studied. Pollen traits and sequence data
   provide evidence for separating D. neomexicanum from species D.
   procumbens. In general, the result from the pollen analysis is congruent
   with results obtained from a preliminary molecular analysis of this
   group.},

Title = {Heterochronic changes during embryonic development of neotropical foam
   nesting frogs (genus Leptodactylus)},
Journal = {ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {266},
Pages = {35-49},
Abstract = {At least five different reproductive modes were reported in the
   neotropical frog genus Leptodactylus, all of them involving the building
   of foam nests. We analyzed the early ontogeny of five species of the L.
   fuscus group building terrestrial chambers where eggs are deposited, and
   of two species of the L latrans group constructing a floating nest over
   the surface of lentic waters. The ontogenetic period described herein
   includes the occurrence of exclusively embryonic structures and the
   initial stages of development of larval features. In a likely relation
   to ecological aspects of oviposition and developmental mode, embryos of
   these two groups differ in several features. Embryos of the L fuscus
   group were mainly pigment less, were large sized with an extensive yolk
   provision, showed a dorsal kyphosis and lacked adhesive glands.
   Conversely, embryos of the L latrans group were darkly pigmented, lacked
   a dorsal curvature, were comparatively smaller and less yolked, and
   showed adhesive glands in a peculiar type D morphogenetic pattern.
   Embryos of the L latrans group had long, profusely branched, highly
   ciliated external gills, which were arranged ventrally. The comparative
   analysis of developmental sequences revealed an early emergence of hind
   limbs in Leptodactylus species relative to a reference leiuperine
   trajectory, an earlier differentiation of external gills in the species
   of the L fuscus group, and an overall earlier development of mouthparts
   in embryos of the L. latrans group. Further analyses in a phylogenetic
   context are needed to evaluate the ancestral reconstructions of the
   development sequence and detect evolutionary relevant heterochronies in
   the genus. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM; Aerodyne Inc.)
   was deployed at a site north of Mexico City from November 13, 2013 to
   April 30, 2014 to investigate the seasonal variability of the chemical
   composition of submicron particles. The ACSM provides real time
   information on mass concentration of the non-refractory main species
   (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride and organic compounds) in
   particulate matter less than 1 mu m (NR-PM1) with a 30-min time
   resolution. Meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity,
   and wind speed and direction), as well as concentrations of black
   carbon, PM1, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NO, NO2, and O-3, were also measured. The
   total NR-PM1 mass concentrations plus black carbon (which must be close
   to the PM1 total mass) showed a good correlation with PM1 mass
   concentration measured with a Tapered Element Oscillating Micro-Balance,
   an indication of the soundness of the ACSM data. In average, the
   composition of the aerosol as well as its diurnal variability were
   similar to observations in previous studies using similar instruments
   (MCMA-2003 and MILAGRO). However, it was observed that the aerosol was
   persistently acidic during November and December probably due to a
   higher relative humidity, lower temperature, and more frequent winds
   from the NW, where the Tula industrial complex is located. A lower
   concentration of ammonia (NH3) in the gas phase might affect the PM
   acidity too. These results suggest a seasonal variability in the aerosol
   chemistry in Mexico City, which should be verified with more long-term
   studies.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, genetic algorithms stand out for airfoil optimisation, due to
   the virtues of mutation and crossing-over techniques. In this work we
   propose a genetic algorithm with arithmetic crossover rules. The
   optimisation criteria are taken to be the maximisation of both
   aerodynamic efficiency and lift coefficient, while minimising drag
   coefficient. Such algorithm shows greatly improvements in computational
   costs, as well as a high performance by obtaining optimised airfoils for
   Mexico City's specific wind conditions from generic wind turbines
   designed for higher Reynolds numbers, in few iterations.},

Abstract = {The advection-diffusion equation with time dependent velocity and
   anisotropic time dependent diffusion tensor is examined in regard to its
   non-classical transport features and to the use of a non-orthogonal
   coordinate system. Although this equation appears in diverse physical
   problems, particularly in particle transport in stochastic velocity
   fields and in underground porous media, a detailed analysis of its
   solutions is lacking. In order to study the effects of the
   time-dependent coefficients and the anisotropic diffusion on transport,
   we solve analytically the equation for an initial Dirac delta pulse. We
   discuss the solutions to three cases: one based on power-law correlation
   functions where the pulse diffuses faster than the classical rate
   similar to t, a second case specifically designed to display slower rate
   of diffusion than the classical one, and a third case to describe
   hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media.},

Abstract = {Computationalism is a relatively vague term used to describe attempts to
   apply Turing's model of computation to phenomena outside its original
   purview: in modelling the human mind, in physics, mathematics, etc.
   Early versions of computationalism faced strong objections from many
   (and varied) quarters, from philosophers to practitioners of the
   aforementioned disciplines. Here we will not address the fundamental
   question of whether computational models are appropriate for describing
   some or all of the wide range of processes that they have been applied
   to, but will focus instead on whether `renovated' versions of the new
   computationalism shed any new light on or resolve previous tensions
   between proponents and skeptics. We find this, however, not to be the
   case, because the new computationalism falls short by using limited
   versions of ``traditional computation{''}, or proposing computational
   models that easily fall within the scope of Turing's original model, or
   else proffering versions of hypercomputation with its many pitfalls.},

Abstract = {The male and the tritonymph of Ioanella mimon are described for the
   first time parasitizing to Mimon cozumelae from Yucatan, Mexico. Male of
   I. mimon is characterized by the presence of legs I with the tibia and
   tarsus fused forming a small complex devoided of apical claws, legs
   II-IV with two claws, setae vi at level of anterior end of genital
   plate, genital plate rounded with an anterior projection, all intercoxal
   setae short; while the tritonymph is characterized by the presence of
   legs I unequal; legs II-IV with 2-1-1 claws, and posterior region of
   dorsal idiosoma with 3 pairs of cylindrical and toothed setae.
   Additionally, we include new locality and host records for Eudusbabekia
   mimon which was also found on M. cozumelae. Both species were described
   originally in association with Mimon bennettii at Bartica, Guyana.},

Abstract = {The PREDICTS project-Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In
   Changing Terrestrial Systems (www.predicts.org.uk)-has collated from
   published studies a large, reasonably representative database of
   comparable samples of biodiversity from multiple sites that differ in
   the nature or intensity of human impacts relating to land use. We have
   used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical
   models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe
   and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing
   more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and
   representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help
   in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology.
   To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and
   taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of
   biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to
   researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand
   the global status of biodiversity.},

Abstract = {A new species of Lohmannia, L. maya n. sp., from mangrove soils in
   Mexico is described and illustrated. It is morphologically similar to L.
   similis Balogh, 1962, L. jornoti Mahunka, 1985 and L. lanceolata
   Grandjean, 1950 but differs from these species in having lateral and
   posterior setae wide in their proximal half and thin in their distal
   half, ending in a sharp tip, and a continuous notogastral band S-8. It
   also has a smaller body size (727 mu m) compared with the three
   aforementioned species (790, 810 and 840 mu m respectively). The 11
   species of the genus Lohmannia recorded from the Americas were compared,
   a key for them is included, and some ecological notes for the new
   species are also provided.},

Abstract = {Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs) are molecules with carbon numbers
   C35-C37, usually with tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran rings and one
   terminal gamma-lactone (usually alpha,beta-unsaturated), in a large
   aliphatic chain that is varyingly hydroxylated, acetoxylated or
   ketonized. ACGs have ecological functions as insecticides and are
   pharmacologically promising due to their cytotoxic and antitumoral
   properties. They are found in the seeds, leaves, roots, flowers and
   fruits of annonaceous plants and can be detected during isolation via
   thin-layer chromatography using Kedde's reagent, which reacts with the
   unsaturated lactone. This chapter describes the location in situ of ACGs
   in fresh sections of annonaceous seeds using Kedde's reagent.
   The acetogenins are located in the idioblasts, in the endosperm and in
   the embryonic axis during differentiation. This method can aid in the
   detection of ACGs with a terminal unsaturated.-lactone in organs and
   tissues.},

Abstract = {Identification of a new class of antitumor agent capable to induce
   apoptosis without triggering necrotic cell death event is challenging.
   The present communication describes the multicomponent synthesis of
   seven new (1S,4S)-2,5-diazabicyclo{[}2.2.1]heptane-dithiocarbamates and
   their in vitro antiproliferative activity on cervical cancer cell line
   (CaSki), breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB231), lung cancer cell line
   (SK-Lu-1) and human lymphocytes. Among the synthesized dithiocarbamates,
   compound 9e displayed significant antiproliferative activity without
   inducing any necrotic cell death (both on tumour cells and lymphocytes)
   and induced apoptosis in tumor cells by the caspase dependent apoptotic
   pathway. The compound 9e also exhibited greater tumor selectivity than
   human lymphocytes. In silico ADME predictions revealed that compound 9e
   has the potential to be developed as a drug candidate. Rapid chemical
   modifications of this lead are thus highly necessary for further
   investigation as a drug like safer antitumor candidate and also to
   achieve compounds with better activity profile.},

Abstract = {This article aims to characterize the sector of Mexican cybermedia using
   the diffusion of innovations theory and analyzing the level of adoption
   of technologies associated with discursive elements of the digital
   environment. For this purpose, an inventory of cybermedia in the country
   was made. Furthermore, the cybermedia sector is described based on its
   geographic location. Finally, we analyze the levels of diffusion of
   digital technologies such as multimedia, APPs and augmented reality. We
   conclude that the video technologies have the highest level of adoption.
   Likewise, we found that native organizations have the highest levels of
   adoption in multimedia technologies},

Abstract = {Waterborne acrylate hybrid nanocomposites containing 1 wt\%
   nanoparticles were synthesized by in situ polymerization using SiO2 and
   Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The synthesized latex hybrids were characterized by
   thermogravimetric analysis, uniaxial tension, nano-indentation and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Films drawn from the latex exhibited
   excellent optical transparency and no evidence of aggregation was
   detected by SEM and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis
   confirmed the presence of silica and iron throughout the films. The
   thermal properties showed a decrease of the glass transition temperature
   in the presence of Fe2O3 nanoparticles as demonstrated by the dynamic
   mechanical analysis. The nano-SiO2 induced significantly higher thermal
   stability, as decomposition temperatures of the nanocomposites increases
   by as much as 40 degrees C relative to the neat acrylic. On the other
   hand, the Young's modulus and hardness of the nanocomposites films
   decrease about 30 and 65\%, denoting a modification of macromolecular
   dynamic by the SiO2 and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, respectively.},

   weights. We will show that the location of the root can be described in
   terms of the maxima of a random walk, whose distribution will depend on
   the geometry of the substrate (line). For flat substrates, we will get
   power law behaviour of the height function, study its scaling limit, and
   describe it in terms of variational problems involving the Airy process.

   electron capture cross section for proton collisions with CO within the
   energy range of 2 keV to 10 keV. Time of flight mass spectroscopy was
   employed in the measurements of CO+, O+ and and the contribution of the
   different channels was evaluated. Ionization was found to be the
   dominant reaction channel as expected, while the C+ ionic fragments
   intensity was found to be higher than those of O+. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {In this paper we are interesting in knowing which features provide
   useful information for detecting a fall and how the set of selected
   characteristics impact the accuracy of detection. For this purpose two
   sets of features are used. The first one describes the shape of the
   detected person, and the second one, the change of the shape over the
   time. All of features are extracted from a cloud of points of a detected
   person by the Kinect device. To determinate a fallen pose, a generative
   model is used. Two experiments are carried out to analyze the effect of
   using two different subset of features, one of them selected by a
   Genetic Algorithm and the second by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
   The obtained results suggest that the success of detection of fall
   depends on the selected features, and the genetic algorithm is a good
   technique to select them, when compared with PCA.},

Title = {A diversity world record in a grassland at Oaxaca, Mexico},
Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Plant richness world-records have been reported to occur
   either in tropical rainforests, or, at smaller spatial scales, in
   chronically disturbed grasslands. The tight relationship between scale
   and record richness suggests that there is an unyielding limit to
   diversity.
   Hypotheses: If such limit exists, current records should hardly be
   beaten. Chronic disturbance in grasslands allows richness to approach
   the limit.
   Studied species: All vascular plants at the study site. Study site and
   years of study: A natural, semiarid grassland at Concepcion Buenavista,
   Oaxaca, Mexico, in 2012 and 2014.
   Methods: At 21 sites we recorded species richness in randomly sampled
   0.1 x 0.1 m quadrats, and measured chronic disturbance caused by
   different agents. We estimated the maximum richness at each site through
   maximum likelihood. At one site we searched for high richness quadrats.
   Results: The study site shares the current world record of plant
   richness at the 0.1 x 0.1 m scale with 25 species. The estimated maximum
   diversity at each site decreased with land degradation, but had a
   maximum at intermediate-high levels of livestock activity.
   Conclusions: Our results support the idea of a hard limit to species
   richness, and thus theories of plant coexistence that envisage such
   limit. Our study site shares attributes with other record-holding
   grasslands, such as severe resource limitations and chronic disturbance
   by ungulates, suggesting that these conditions promote high species
   richness. We hope that, by reporting this diversity record, we also help
   to change the notion that Mexican grasslands are secondary communities
   having a negligible biological value.},

Abstract = {Wireless communications have experienced a tremendous development during
   the last decade. The interaction of the electromagnetic waves as a
   function of the frequency and intensity with physical objects remains
   largely unknown. This poses the challenge to study the physical
   mechanisms involved to actually quantify the impact of the interaction
   with other objects caused by various electromagnetic waves-emitting
   sources. Here, we proposed the design of a plane SRR (Split-Ring
   Resonator) with metamaterial circular rings for S-Band frequency range.
   To guide the construction of the SRR prototype, simulations of the
   bandwidth were conducted using the Finite Integral technique. A
   logarithmic function describes the dependence of the simulated resonant
   frequency. The maximum simulated bandwidth of the SRR can be reached
   with an even number of concentric rings.},

Abstract = {A plan to study the total cross section for the C-13(d, p)C-14 nuclear
   reaction has been developed for energies in the center-of-mass frame
   between 133 and 400 keV. The proposed experiment will use a deuterium
   beam (1-3 MeV of energy) from the Instituto de Fisica-UNAM 5.5 MV Van de
   Graaff accelerator and the produced C-14 will be afterwards measured by
   AMS technique in the LEMA-UNAM (HVEE 1 MV Tandetron). One of the main
   goals is to study the performance of the LEMA-UNAM facility in the cross
   section measurement in comparison with other data reported in the
   literature, measured by other techniques. In this work we present the
   current status of these studies. The relevance of the C-13(d, p)C-14
   reaction in the study of compound nucleus formation as well as in some
   astrophysics scenarios, and the importance of the development of the AMS
   technique to measure cross sections of nuclear reactions of
   astrophysical interest in Mixico are also discussed.},

Title = {Localization and distribution of gonadal proteins in the oviparous
   lizard Sceloporus aeneus (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae)},
Journal = {ACTA HISTOCHEMICA},

Volume = {119},

Abstract = {Among vertebrates, several specific proteins are involved in the
   function and development of gonads. Several genes such as SOX9, FOXL2,
   DDX4, IFITM3, and DPPA3, are active during embryonic differentiation and
   maintain their expression in adult tissues, playing important roles in
   the function and development of the line cell, where these are produced.
   Among reptiles, molecular mechanisms for sex differentiation have been
   analyzed in turtles, crocodiles, and some lizards, while in adult stages
   such studies are scarce. The aim of this study was to locate and analyze
   the distribution of important gonadal proteins in adult and embryonic
   ovaries and testes of the oviparous lizard Sceloporus aeneus (Squamata:
   Phrynosomatidae). Adult specimens and embryos of the lizard S. aeneus
   were collected in Milpa Alta, a suburb located Southwest of Mexico City.
   Expression of gonadal proteins was analyzed using immunofluorescent
   staining and confocal microscopy. Our results showed that SOX9 is
   located in Sertoli cells of embryonic and adult testes. FOXL2 is
   expressed in follicular cells of adult ovaries. DDX4 and IFITM3 are
   located in germ line cells as well as in follicular cells of adult
   ovaries. DPPA3 was observed in somatic and germ line cells of adult and
   embryonic gonads. Our observations show that important molecules of
   vertebrate ovaries and testes are conserved in S. aeneus and it is
   suggested that these may have a similar role during gonadal development
   and function.},

Abstract = {We have studied the effect of pores on the vibrational and thermodynamic
   behavior of amorphous silicon (a-Si) by separating the normal modes of
   vibration according to their spatial localization, as well as according
   to which atoms they are more localized or biased on, depending on their
   coordination, which differs on average at the surface and in the
   interior of the atomic skeletons. This latter classification has been
   done using a new quantity which we call the weighted average
   coordination. The presence of pores suppresses the boson peak found in
   nonporous a-Si and introduces a new peak in the specific heat curves
   arising principally from internal surface related modes. The effect of
   porosity on the internal energy of a-Si at low temperatures is also
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {During the software development cycle, software products can undergo
   many changes in requirements and design. In one of those products, the
   source code of the system, these changes can impact the original
   specifications and design, leading to tangled and scattered code that
   affects the design and maintenance processes. Research efforts have been
   made to analyze the scattered code for concerns identification and
   extraction. In object oriented systems, these concerns can be
   distributed across many classes, leading to the definition and
   identification of crosscutting concerns. Many methods have been proposed
   to identify, extract and separate crosscutting concerns. In this paper,
   a method for crosscutting concerns identification using information
   retrieval techniques is presented. This work aims to identify the core
   crosscutting concerns, which are the main tasks a system has to satisfy
   whose code is scattered over the different classes of the system.
   Information retrieval provides advantages over common parsing techniques
   since the code is treated as unstructured text, making the method
   programming language independent.},

Abstract = {The Mexican Sign Language (MSL) has its own structure and grammar
   different from the Spanish spoken in Mexico. The MSL is composed of more
   than 1000 signs used by the deaf community of this country. Few hearing
   people know and use MSL, therefore there is a communication barrier
   between hearing and deaf people. In order to overcome this issue, we
   propose a non-invasive sign detection application, so that the
   interlocutor interacts with the system in a natural way interpreting a
   set of signs of the MSL using a bimodal cognitive vision system. Our
   application uses a Kinect sensor to obtain the gestures, geometric
   moments and Hidden Markov models to process it. From experiments
   performed with 10 people, it was concluded that our application achieved
   an average sensitivity of 86\% and an average specificity of 80\%.},

Abstract = {The oviducal glands (ODG) play a crucial role in octopus reproduction.
   Herein, structural changes of each section of the ODG of Octopus mimus
   are described histologically throughout the gonad development stages
   (GDS). To do this, the epithelial height, stereociliated or
   non-stereociliated epithelium, nucleus type (pycnotic or non-pycnotic),
   epithelial secretions and the value range of the macroscopic maturity
   index (MaMI), which directly involves ODG status, were measured. The ODG
   are internally constituted of two glandular units (central and
   peripheral glands) and one set of receptacles (the spermathecae). High
   epithelia (40 to 80m) were observed in both gland units during periods
   with low MaMI values (< 0.1) corresponding to III-mature and
   IV-pre-spawning. The stereociliated epithelium was only apparent in
   II-maturing and III-mature in both gland units. The nuclei were
   noticeably pycnotic in the central gland during III-mature,
   IV-pre-spawning and V-spawning, but pycnotic in the peripheral gland
   only during VI-depletion. The epithelium was disorganised during
   VI-depletion, while sulphated acid mucin was only present during
   III-mature in the central gland. The epithelium transformations during
   the GDS are related to the functions of the gland units and to their
   multiple secretions. The ODG histology complements the GDS and provides
   better reproductive status assessment.},

   Hypothalamic tissue was collected at 5 h, 10 h, 15 h, 19 h and 24 h.
   Samples were analyzed by western blotting to determine the relative
   presence of protein for LepRb, STAT3 phosphorylation (by pSTAT3/STAT3
   ratio) and POMC. Obese mice were 60\% less active in locomotion than
   lean mice during the night. While both locomotor activity and food
   intake were noticeably greater during the day in obese mice than in lean
   mice, the hypothalamus in obese mice showed a lower relative abundance
   of POMC and reduced pSTAT3/STAT3 ratio and leptin receptors. Behavioral
   and biochemical differences were more evident in obese females than in
   obese males. These results indicate that obesity in N. alstoni affects
   hypothalamic leptin signaling according to sex.},

Abstract = {Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The life
   cycle of this protozoan parasite is digenetic because it alternates its
   different developmental forms through two hosts, a vector insect and a
   vertebrate host. As a result, the parasites are exposed to sudden and
   drastic environmental changes causing cellular stress. The stress
   response to some types of stress has been studied in T. cruzi, mainly at
   the molecular level; however, data about ultrastructure and
   physiological state of the cells in stress conditions are scarce or
   null. In this work, we analyzed the morphological, ultrastructural, and
   physiological changes produced on T. cruzi epimastigotes when they were
   exposed to acid, nutritional, heat, and oxidative stress. Clear
   morphological changes were observed, but the physiological conditions
   varied depending on the type of stress. The maintenance of the
   physiological state was severely affected by heat shock, acidic,
   nutritional, and oxidative stress. According to the surprising observed
   growth recovery after damage by stress alterations, different
   adaptations from the parasite to these harsh conditions were suggested.
   Particular cellular death pathways are discussed.},

Abstract = {Syngnathids, particularly seahorses, have long fascinated humans.
   Surprisingly, their biology and ecology is still poorly known. That is
   probably one of the reasons why reared fishes of these species have only
   recently been introduced into the aquarium trade. Currently, rearing
   techniques are available for a dozen seahorse species and for a few
   ornamental pipefishes. Even though the morphology of all these species
   is rather similar, their biology and rearing requirements largely differ
   among species. As a result, the methodological procedures for
   cultivation must be studied and assessed explicitly for each species.
   Noteworthy survivals have been achieved for some species but there is a
   need for optimization of rearing techniques, and increased knowledge in
   many aspects including breeding, nutritional requirements and diseases.
   This chapter is focused on general aspects of the biology of seahorses
   and pipefishes and on current knowledge of their rearing techniques.
   Data sheets on the rearing requirements for selected seahorse and
   pipefish species are also provided, as well as for seadragons.},

Title = {Electronegativity and intrinsic disorder of preeclampsia-related
   proteins},
Journal = {ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-111},
Abstract = {Preeclampsia, hemorrhage, and infection are the leading causes of
   maternal death in underdeveloped countries. Since several proteins
   associated with preeclampsia are known, we conducted a computational
   study which evaluated the commonness and potential functionality of
   intrinsic disorder of these proteins and also made an attempt to
   characterize their origin. The origin of the preeclampsia-related
   proteins was assessed with a supervised technique, a Polarity Index
   Method (PIM), which evaluates the electronegativity of proteins based
   solely on their sequence. The commonness of intrinsic disorder was
   evaluated using several disorder predictors from the PONDR family, the
   charge-hydropathy plot (CH-plot) and cumulative distribution function
   (CDF) analyses, and using the MobiDB web-based tool, whereas potential
   functionality of intrinsic disorder was studied with the D2P2 resource
   and ANCHOR predictor of disorder-based binding sites, and the STRING
   tool was used to build the interactivity networks of the
   preeclampsia-related proteins. Peculiarities of the PIM-derived polar
   profile of the group of preeclampsia-related proteins were then compared
   with profiles of a group of lipoproteins, antimicrobial peptides,
   angiogenesis-related proteins, and the intrinsically disordered
   proteins. Our results showed a high graphical correlation between
   preeclampsia proteins, lipoproteins, and the angiogenesis proteins. We
   also showed that many preeclampsia-related proteins contain numerous
   functional disordered regions. Therefore, these bioinformatics results
   led us to assume that the preeclampsia proteins are highly associated
   with the lipoproteins group, and that some preeclampsia-related proteins
   contain significant amounts of functional disorders.},

Abstract = {A C-1-C-3 short chemical-kinetic mechanism (the San Diego mechanism),

   ignition and combustion of n-butane over a range of conditions that
   encompasses both low-temperature and high-temperature chemistry, as well
   as both high and low pressures. Tests of predictions against measured
   ignition delays and laminar burning velocities are reported, as are
   comparisons with recent measurements in jet-stirred reactors, supporting
   the predictions of the mechanism, which may be useful in combustion
   computations, especially when larger mechanisms would be too

Title = {New records of marine green algae (Ulvophyceae) from Tabasco, Mexico},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {121-138},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The knowledge of the phycoflora in the state of
   Tabasco is scarce, with 38 records of Rhodophyta, seven of Ochrophyta,
   and only five of Chlorophyta. Additionally, at national level it is the
   coastal state with the lowest number of publications about this topic.
   Therefore, this study was developed to contribute to the knowledge of
   its algal flora, particularly of Chlorophyta.
   Methods: Material of the herbaria of the Faculty of Sciences of the UNAM
   (FCME) and the Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco (UJAT) was
   revised. Two sampling periods were conducted during the rainy and dry
   seasons in seven locations on the coast of Tabasco. The collected
   material was preserved in formaldehyde at 4\%. Observations of the
   thalli and sections were made with stereoscopic and light microscopes.
   Identification was carried out with specialized literature.
   Key results: Seventeen new records of species of green algae are
   presented for the coast of Tabasco, belonging to seven genera, five
   families and four orders. The orders with the highest species richness
   were Cladophorales and Ulvales, with eight and seven species,
   respectively. Families with the highest species number were Ulvaceae and
   Cladophoraceae with seven each. The most diverse genus was Ulva, with
   seven species.
   Conclusions: The number of seaweeds of the class Ulvophyceae registered
   in Tabasco rises from five to 22 records, representing 18\% of
   Chlorophyta species recorded for the Gulf of Mexico. It is the first
   time that Chaetomorpha nodosa is reported for the coast of Mexico.},

   justifying the need to evaluate alternative WHM. The pirfenidone (PFD)
   and collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone (Collagen-PVP) decrease inflammation
   and fibrosis. This study assessed the effect of PFD administration and
   Collagen-PVP topical application on macroscopic and microscopic changes,
   TGF-beta 1 expression, and CD in an experimental model of tracheal wound
   healing. Forty Wistar rats underwent cervical tracheoplasty, were
   divided into 4 groups (n = 10), and were treated with different WHM:
   group I, saline solution (SS); group II, Collagen-PVP; group III,
   mitomycin C (MMC); and group IV, 40 mg/kg PFD. Four weeks after surgery,
   the macroscopic and microscopic changes, in situ TGF-beta 1 expression,
   and CD in posttracheoplasty scars were evaluated. The animals treated
   with Collagen-PVP and PFD developed less inflammation and fibrosis than
   animals in the other study groups (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis) and,
   moreover, showed lower TGF-beta 1 expression and CD than animals in
   group I (p < 0.05, ANOVA and Tukey's test). In conclusion, PFD and
   Collagen-PVP decrease inflammation, fibrosis, TGF beta-1 expression, and
   CD in the posttracheoplasty rats'scar.},

Title = {Effect of livestock and seasonal variation on floristic composition and
   plant biomass in wetlands of the central western coast of the Gulf of
   Mexico},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {79-99},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which
   provide many environmental services. However, they are one of the most
   threatened due to human activities such as agriculture and livestock.
   Mexico has lost 62\% of its wetlands and specifically those of the
   central coast of the Gulf of Mexico are being affected due to livestock
   pressure. There are very few studies about the subject, so in this paper
   we analyze the effect of livestock and seasonality on floristic
   composition, above ground biomass (AB) and below ground biomass (BB) of
   the Alvarado lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico.
   Methods: We selected two working locations, and in each locality chose
   two sampling sites. In each site, we placed eight 1 m(2) plots of four
   different locations (half were fenced to keep out livestock). For an
   entire year we obtained species richness and diversity, and data on
   vegetation cover, as well as AB and BB. With the data obtained, we
   calculated the Relative Importance Value (RIV) by species and the
   relative replacement rate of species.
   Key results: Total richness resulted in 29 species. A disturbance
   gradient was observed, with the best conserved sites in Rio Blanco. In
   most sites, species richness was significantly higher in rainfall and
   species with high RIV were typical wetland species, although there were
   dominant grasses in both climatic seasons. BB was significantly higher
   in one location of Rio Blanco, and AB in one location of Rio Blanco and
   in one from Rio Limon. During the rainy season, AB was higher in half of
   the sites.
   Conclusions: We conclude that freshwater wetlands can retain their
   ecological functions in the presence of livestock as long as the impact
   is low. Even if there is cattle grazing with a controlled management, it
   can promote diversity of native wetland species and limit the growth of
   invasive grasses.},

Abstract = {We experimentally show that, by using spatial correlations of photon
   pairs produced by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion, it is possible
   to increase the Signal to Noise Ratio in images of objects illuminated

   to produce an average improvement in signal to noise ratio of 11dB of
   Parametric Down-Converted light over laser light. This simple method can
   be easily implemented for obtaining high contrast images of faint
   objects and for transmitting information with low noise.},

Title = {Robust root growth in altered hydrotropic response
   1 (ahr1) mutant of Arabidopsis is maintained by
   high rate of cell production at low water potential gradient},

Abstract = {Hydrotropism is the directional root growth response determined by water
   stimulus. In a water potential gradient system (WPGS) the roots of the
   Arabidopsis wild type have a diminished root growth compared to normal
   medium (NM). In contrast, the altered hydrotropic response] (ahrl)
   mutant roots maintain their robust growth in the same WPGS. The aims of
   this work were to ascertain how ahrl roots could sustain growth in the
   WPGS, with a special focus on the integration of cellular processes
   involved in the signaling that determines root growth during abiotic
   stress and their relation to hydrotropism. Cellular analysis of the root
   apical meristem of ahrl mutant contrary to the wild type showed an
   absence of changes in the meristem length, the elongation zone length,
   the length of fully elongated cells, and the cell cycle duration. The
   robust and steady root growth of ahrl seedlings in the WPGS is explained
   by the mutant capacity to maintain cell production and cell elongation
   at the same level as in the NM. Analysis of auxin response at a
   transcriptional level showed that roots of the ahrl mutant had a lower
   auxin response when grown in the WPGS, compared to wild type, indicating
   that auxin signaling participates in attenuation of root growth under
   water stress conditions. Also, wild type plants exhibited a high
   increase in proline content while ahrl mutants showed minimum changes in
   the Normal Medium Water Stress Medium (NM WSM), a lower water potential
   gradient system than the WPGS. Accordingly, in this condition, gene
   expression of Delta 1- 6 Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Synthetasel (p5CS1)
   involved in proline synthesis strongly increased in wild type but not in
   ahrl seedlings. The ahrl phenotype shows unique features since the
   mutant root cells continue to proliferate and grow in the presence of a
   progressively negative water potential gradient at a level comparable to
   wild type growing in the NM. As such, it represents an exceptional
   resource for understanding hydrotropism. (C)2016 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {Reptonoditrypa cautica Schafer and Fois is a bryozoan species that
   constituted an important part of the encrusting/binder guild of the
   Triassic reefs, mainly in the Ladinian and Carnian. In the Cipit
   boulders of the St. Cassian Formation, it is usually associated with
   specimens of the thalamid sponge Cryptocoelia zitteli (a member of the
   constructor/baffler guild), although it can also be seen forming crusts
   along with microbialites on top of other species of reef builders. It is
   worth mentioning that, although the sponge is always linked to the
   bryozoan, this does not apply for the opposite. It is also worth to
   pinpoint the absence of Reptonoditrypa cautica in other thin-section
   samples of reef facies from these boulders, as well as the fact that it
   is the only kind of microencrusting bryozoan found in about 400 thin
   sections. This article explains the paleoecological role played by this
   species in the reef systems of the St. Cassian Formation.},

Abstract = {Most of our understanding on embryonic development in cephalopods comes
   from studies using constant temperature. Even though spawning generally
   occurs at relatively stable environments, eggs and embryos can be
   exposed over short periods of time to high temperature anomalies caused
   by oceanic warming. Therefore, in this study we examined the effects of
   increasing temperatures on growth, respiratory metabolism, and
   antioxidant defense mechanisms to define the thermal limits of Octopus
   maya embryos in a changing environment. Ramp temperatures consisted in
   increments of 1 degrees C every 5 days from 24 degrees C to 30 degrees
   C. The thermal limit of embryos at ramp temperatures was detected at 27
   degrees C with metabolic rate increments between 63\% and 69\%, compared
   with the metabolic rate observed at control temperature (24 degrees C).
   Based on the calculated integrated biomarker response (IBR) was possible
   to detect that at the thermal limit, an increment on oxygen consumption
   was observed joint with reactive oxygen species (ROS). The IBR analysis
   indicated that above 27 degrees C embryos experienced changes in the
   oxidative system and were not able to recover. This study suggests that
   in a scenario of rapidly increasing temperatures after a short winter,
   O. maya embryos may suffer irreversible effects that are likely to
   negatively affect recruitment and the population dynamic. The thermal
   sensitivity of O. maya embryos, revealed in the present work, indicates
   that this species has an important potential for biomonitoring of the
   effects of environmental warming. Changes in the population dynamics of
   this species should be further studied since they can be used as a proxy
   for warming of the southern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Predicting old-growth tropical forest attributes from very high
   resolution (VHR)-derived surface metrics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {492-513},
Abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests are increasingly vanishing worldwide.
   Although the accurate quantification of tropical old-growth forests
   attributes is essential to understand, manage, and conserve their high
   diversity and biomass, conducting this task over large areas and at fine
   detail is not only expensive and time consuming, but also often
   practically impossible. This calls for the search for more efficient
   alternatives, particularly those based on remote sensing. In this study,
   we evaluate the potential of several surface metrics (tone and texture)
   extracted from very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery to model the
   structural and diversity attributes of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in
   southern Mexico. We constructed simple linear models that used each
   forest attribute as dependent variables, and the tone and texture
   metrics extracted from several bands, the panchromatic (resolution = 0.5
   m), red (R), infrared, and two vegetation indices (normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI); resolution = 2
   m), of a VHR image (GeoEye-1) as predictive variables. The significance
   of the models including one, two, two and its interaction, and three
   image metrics was evaluated by comparing them with null models. The
   structural characteristics of the TDF (basal area (BA), mean height,
   stem density) showed the highest modelling potential, with the
   goodness-of-fit (R-2) values ranging from 0.58 to 0.66. Conversely, no
   significant models were obtained for total crown area (TCA) and all
   diversity attributes. Our results show that remote-sensing metrics
   detect the spatial variation in the structural attributes of this
   old-growth TDF better than they detect the variation in its diversity.
   Our ability to model forest attributes at large scales at fine detail
   (sampling plots <0.2 ha) can be much improved by combining the use of
   VHR imagery with an array as wide as possible of the image surface
   metrics, including both tone and texture.},

Abstract = {Internet-based monitoring of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) has become
   more common since its beginnings over a decade ago, both through
   estimates based on the number of searches for influenza-related terms
   (e.g., Google flu trends), or by means of participatory surveillance
   systems. The latter, often seen as ways of engaging people in matters of
   scientific and public health importance, gather a wealth of potentially
   valuable epidemiological information complementary to that obtained
   through the established disease surveillance networks and also usually
   absent from search-based web algorithms.
   We present a statistical analysis of the data from the Mexican
   monitoring website ``Reporta{''} by which the risk factors linked to
   reporting of ILI symptoms as outcome among its participants are
   determined, and interpret these results based on current knowledge of
   the factors that influence transmission of infection resulting in
   disease. Besides standard factors associated with enhanced
   susceptibility to infection some novel behavioral factors linked to high
   risk were: (i) use of public transport; (ii) frequent contact with
   animals, and (iii) use of non-standard interventions, such as
   homeopathy. While close contact with large groups of people in public
   transportation is generally assumed to be important in disease spread,
   frequent contact with animals is not. Our results are consistent with
   previous observations that animals may serve as mobile fomites and hence
   increase the propensity to develop disease. We conclude that analysis of
   rich information sets from Internet-based systems may suggest novel
   ideas on disease spread that are worth following up with field research.},

Title = {North American matsutake: names clarified and a new species described},
Journal = {MYCOLOGIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {109},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-390},
Abstract = {Tricholoma matsutake, known widely as ``matsutake,{''}has great
   commercial and cultural significance in Japan. Because Japanese
   production is insufficient to meet the high domestic demand,
   morphologically similar mushrooms, thought by many to belong to T.
   magnivelare, are imported from western North America. However, molecular
   data produced since the early 2000s have indicated that more than one
   species of matsutake occur in North America and this raises the question
   of correct naming for the different species. To address this question,
   we assessed the phylogenetic diversity within North American matsutake
   based on nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer {[}ITS]
   barcode) sequences, including newly obtained sequences from the type
   collections for Agaricus ponderosus and Armillaria arenicola, and
   morphological characters. Our results agree with earlier indications
   that three matsutake species occur in North America and allow us to
   clarify the correct application of names-T. magnivelare from the eastern
   USA and Canada, T. murrillianum from the western USA and Canada, and T.
   mesoamericanum from Mexico, newly described here. The existence of the
   three North American species is further supported by the results of
   evolutionary divergence analysis, geographical distributions, and
   morphological characters.},

Abstract = {Agro- and forest-industrial wastes are abundant and low cost sources of
   carbohydrates and phenolic compounds, which can be converted into
   biofuels, biomaterials, and high added-value compounds by different
   pathways in small and large biorefineries. The development of
   technologies based on hydrothermal treatments could improve the
   utilization of lignocellulosic wastes through the separation of its
   components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives) in
   sequential processes. The adopted technologies for the separation and
   conversion of these lignocellulosic wastes into synthesis intermediates
   or products of high added value represent an important part of the total
   production cost. Low liquid to solid ratios and mild temperatures in the
   pretreatment are interesting ways of reducing energy costs, subsequently
   economizing both steam and electricity. This work focuses on the
   advantages of using low liquid to solid ratios in the hydrothermal
   treatment of different agro-and forest-industrial wastes, paying
   particular attention to the performance of separation, purification, and
   conversion of hemicelluloses.},

Abstract = {Ground characteristics in the Yucatan Peninsula make recovery and
   treatment of wastewater very expensive. This situation has contributed
   to an increase of pollutants in the aquifer. Unfortunately, studies
   related to the effects of those pollutants in native organisms are
   scarce. The aim of this work was to obtain partial sequences of widely
   known genes used as biomarkers of pollutant effect in Gambusia yucatana
   and Gambusia sexradiata. The studied genes were: cytochrome P450 1A
   (CYP1A); vitellogenin (VTG); metallothionein (MT), and two housekeeping
   genes, 18S and beta-actin. From reported sequences of Gambusia affinis,
   primers were designed and amplification was done in the local Gambusia
   species exposed for 48 h to gasoline (100 A mu L/L, stirred for 24 h
   pre-exposure). Preliminary results revealed partial sequences of all
   genes with an approximate average length of 200 bp. BLAST analysis of
   found sequences indicated a minimum of 97\% identity with reported
   sequences for G. affinis or Gambusia holbrooki showing great similarity.},

Title = {Spatial distribution, size structure and reproduction of Astrophytum
   ornatum (Cactaceae)},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {35-49},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The family Cactaceae possesses the largest number
   of species listed as endangered, but biological information as well as
   ecological studies are needed to assess the conservation status of cacti
   and apply guidelines to include or exclude species from red lists.
   Astrophytum ornatum has a status of vulnerable, but its ecological
   situation has not been evaluated, so its local and regional status is
   unknown. The aim of this study was to determine factors influencing the
   maintenance of their populations to provide information to establish
   their conservation status.
   Methods: We analyzed the population structure, spatial distribution
   pattern and reproduction of A. ornatum in one remnant population in
   Cadereyta de Montes, Queretaro, Mexico.
   Key results: The species has an aggregated spatial distribution pattern,
   which suggests an interaction with nurse species or cracks and rocks
   that provide shade. Individuals are concentrated in the first size
   categories, 34\% were reproductive, large plants have a greater number
   of reproductive structures but with less seeds per fruit in comparison
   to medium-sized plants.
   Conclusions: The studied population has a potential to grow because its
   population structure displays the typical form of species with common
   recruitment. This population structure, high density and the presence of
   small plants suggest that the remaining population of A. ornatum is in
   good condition; however, no recruitment of seedlings was observed, there
   is a high mortality in all size classes and the risks posed to the
   locality are its proximity to human settlements and sand banks. Global
   assessment suggests that A. ornatum should be considered a threatened
   species.},

Abstract = {In this work we study the diffusion adsorption process in porous media
   and analyze the effect that the irregular geometry of the pores has on
   the efficiency of two types of adsorption processes: (a) when there is a
   net flux along the pore and (b) when the pore is completely saturated.
   In the first case, we measured the mass transfer coefficient, which is
   the constant of proportionality between the net flux and the difference
   of concentration. In the second case, we measure the effectiveness
   factor, which is the ratio between the actual rate of adsorption and the
   rate which would be achieved if the entire surface were at the same
   external concentration. In order to perform this analysis, weuse a
   generalized Fick Jacobs equation that considers the net effect of
   diffusion and adsorption along the direction of transport. For this
   analysis we have used wedge-shaped and conical pores, due to the
   simplicity of the treatment and their importance in the elaboration of a
   new brand of artificial materials. We have proved that the enhancement
   or diminution of the mass transfer coefficient or the effectiveness
   factor depend upon the specific rate of adsorption; therefore, they can
   be controlled using our model as a prediction tool in order to build
   artificial materials with a specific output flux of material.
   Additionally, our work allows to find how the Thiele modulus locally
   depends on the geometry of the pore for a linear reaction.},

Title = {Increased Expression of CC16 in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary
   Fibrosis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown
   etiology. The pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, but evidence indicates
   that aberrantly activated alveolar epithelial cells secrete a variety of
   mediators which induce the migration, proliferation and activation of
   fibroblasts and finally the excessive accumulation of extracellular
   matrix with the consequent destruction of the lung parenchyma. CC16
   (approved symbol SCGB1A1), a putative anti-inflammatory protein produced
   by ``club{''} cells in the distal airways, has not been evaluated in IPF
   lungs. In this study, we determined the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage
   (BAL) levels as well as the lung cell localization of this protein.
   Also, we explored the usefulness of serum levels of CC16 for the
   differential diagnosis of IPF (n = 85), compared with non-IPF
   interstitial lung diseases {[}chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP;
   n = 85) and connective tissue diseases (CTD-ILD; n = 85)]. CC16 was
   significantly increased in serum and BAL fluids of IPF patients and was
   found not only in club cells but also in alveolar epithelial cells. When
   compared with non-IPF patients and controls, serum levels were
   significantly increased (p< 0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity for
   CC16 (cut-off 41ng/mL) were 24\% and 90\%, positive predictive value
   56\% and negative predictive value 69\%. These findings demonstrate that
   CC16 is upregulated in IPF patients suggesting that may participate in
   its pathogenesis. Although higher than the serum levels of non-IPF
   patients it shows modest sensitivity to be useful as a potential
   biomarker for the differential diagnosis.},

Abstract = {Total ionization and fragmentation cross sections for proton impact on

   results identify the ionization channel to be the dominant processes.
   Decay routs leading to the fragments CH3+, CH2+, CH+, C+ and H+, points
   to a decreasing cross sections relative to that of ionization. Present
   total cross section was found to agree with pervious experimental
   investigations. Structure within our present total cross sections was
   explained with respect to interference between competing different
   dissociating paths of fragments as well as transition between initial
   and final states as well as with scattering amplitude corresponding to
   different reaction pathways. Comparison with suggested theoretical model
   points to similar trends in the total absolute fragments cross sections.

Abstract = {The spin transition in single crystals of the {[}Fe-II(bbpya) (NCS)(2)]
   (bbpya = N,N-bis(2-2'-bipyrid-6-yl)amine) mononuclear complex was
   investigated by a combination of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
   as well as optical and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. These
   studies, performed around 440 K, revealed an extremely abrupt spin
   transition associated with a structural phase transition from a
   triclinic (low spin) to a monoclinic (mixed low spin/high spin)
   structure. Spatially resolved observations of this transition evidenced
   a clear phase separation associated with heterogeneous nucleation and
   the formation of a moving macroscopic interface whose velocity reached
   in some cases 300 mu m s(-1). Using photothermal control it was possible
   to stabilize biphasic states of the crystal and then acquire AFM images
   of the phase boundary. A ``sawtooth{''} like topography was repeatedly
   observed, which most likely emerges so as to minimize the elastic
   strain. Remarkably, a fine spatial control of the phase boundary could
   be also achieved using the AFM probe itself, through probe-sample
   convective heat exchange.},

Abstract = {The structural, elastic, vibrational, thermodynamic and electronic
   properties of the Mo2B intermetallic under pressure are assessed using
   first-principles calculations based on the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew-Wang (PW91). Our results show
   that the calculated structural parameters at a pressure of zero GPa are
   in good agreement with the available experimental data. The effect of
   high pressures on the lattice constants shows that the compression along
   the c-axis and along the a-axis are similar. The elastic constants were
   calculated using the static finite strain technique, and the bulk shear
   moduli are derived from the ideal polycrystalline aggregate. We find
   that the elastic constants, elastic modulus and hardness monotonically
   increase as a function of pressure; consequently, the structure is
   dynamically stable and tends from brittle to ductile behavior under
   pressure. The Debye temperature theta D increases and the so-called Gru
   neisen constant gamma decreases due to stiffening of the crystal
   structure. The phonon dispersion curves were obtained using the direct
   method. Additionally, the internal energy (Delta E), the Helmholtz free
   energy (Delta F), the entropy (S) and the lattice contribution to the
   heat capacity C-v, were calculated and analyzed with the help of the
   phonon dispersion curves. The N(E-F) and the electron transfer between
   the B and Mo atoms increase as a function of pressure. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve is considered an important area because
   it contains ecosystems with a great diversity and fragility. Besides
   having a high number of endemic, threatened and endangered species, the
   diversity of mammals in Calakmul is also outstanding. However, despite
   recognizing the great diversity of species in the region, little is
   known about the ectoparasites associated with them and the diseases that
   can be transmitted as vectors in the state of Campeche. In this study,
   197 mammalian specimens of which 22 (11.16\%) specimens of 7 species had
   fleas were reviewed, which belong to the families Pulicidae and
   Rhopalopsyllidae (4 genera and 7 species), reaching 10 species of fleas
   in the state, also 5 new species records for the state, 2 are new host
   records and 1 new record for the country are recorded. We are also
   confirming the presence of 2 species of fleas (Ctenocephalides fells
   felts and Pulex irritans) of medical importance and considered as
   potential transmitters of pathogens in the state of Campeche. These
   species have been reported in Yucatan and Guatemala as vectors of
   rickettsia' and bartonellae. (C) 2016 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de

Abstract = {In Latin America and the Caribbean, with a population of approximately
   580 million inhabitants, less than 20 \% of wastewater is treated.
   Megacities in this region face common challenges and problems related
   with water quality and sanitation, which require urgent actions, such as
   changes in the sustainable use of water resources. The Mexico City
   Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in
   the world, with over 20 million inhabitants, and is no exception to the
   challenges of sustainable water management. For more than 100 years,
   wastewater from Mexico City has been transported north to the Mezquital
   Valley, which is ranked as the largest wastewater-irrigated area in the
   world. In this study, bacteria and pathogenic protozoa were analyzed to
   determine the association between the presence of such microorganisms
   and water types (WTs) across sampling sites and seasons in Mexico City
   and the Mezquital Valley. Our results show a difference in
   microbiological water quality between sampling sites and WTs. There is
   no significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons in terms
   of bacterial concentration, demonstrating that water quality remains
   constant at each site regardless of whether it is the dry or the rainy
   season. The results illustrate the quantity of these microorganisms in
   wastewater, provide a current diagnosis of water quality across the area
   which could affect the health of residents in both Mexico City and the
   Mezquital Valley, and demonstrate the need to transition in the short
   term to treat wastewater from a local to a regional scale.},

Abstract = {Bees and flies are the main pollinators responsible for the maintenance
   of plant diversity and crop production. Studies of pollinator
   communities have focused on bees; however, community structures may vary
   among groups of pollinators. We describe and compare the diversity and
   resource use patterns of six Apoidea and two Diptera anthophile families
   in Cuatro Cie ` negas in the northeast of Mexico. We sampled insects in
   two distinct geographic units (valley and mountains) and two seasons
   (rainy and dry). Spatial and temporal patterns in species composition
   and abundance of these families were identified and the diversity in
   each family compared. The spatial and temporal patterns in species
   composition, diversity, and resource use were different for each family.
   Overall, diversity was higher during the rainy season. Only fly families
   and the Andrenidae presented season-specific differences in species
   composition, in contrast with the other Apoidea. Two bee families
   visited more plant species per insect species during the rainy season,
   whereas flies visited the same number of plant species in both seasons.
   Apidae, Megachilidae, and Bombyliidae visited more plant species in the
   mountains, while the other families exhibited no differences between the
   mountains and the valley. The variation in the community structures of
   each group may reflect distinct life histories, resources needs during
   larval stages, and foraging behaviors. These differences are relevant in
   management and conservation programs that could benefit one group of
   pollinators while harming others with different characteristics. The
   traits of some families indicate their potential value as pollinators.},

Abstract = {Macrophytes are common inhabitants of lotic environments and, depending
   on their morphological traits, possess adaptations that provide shelter
   to aquatic invertebrates against strong river flow and predators. They
   may also be used as a food source by macroinvertebrates. The main goal
   of this study was to determine the relationship between the red alga
   Paralemanea mexicana and its role as a shelter and/or food source for
   lotic macroinvertebrates. We also conducted research on the role of
   microhabitat and morphological variations of the alga in determining
   macroinvertebrate taxon abundance, diversity, and functional group
   composition in a high-current velocity river. Results showed that
   changes in cover and morphology of P. mexicana were mostly correlated
   with river current velocity, irradiance, and seasonal variation. In
   turn, these were related to changes in abundance and diversity of the
   associated macroinvertebrate community. In addition, six
   macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups were evaluated for
   associations with the red alga: filtering and gathering collectors,
   piercers, scrapers, herbivore shredders, and predators. The results
   showed that the Trichoptera Hydroptilidae genera Ochrotrichia and
   Metrichia use P. mexicana as a food source and case-building material.
   The Trichoptera Glossosomatidae Mortoniella uses the alga as a
   substrate. The biotic interactions between P. mexicana and associated
   macroinvertebrates reveal the importance of macrophytes as purveyors of
   substrate, as food and shelter for macroinvertebrates, and also as
   promoters of macroinvertebrate community diversity. In addition, it was
   shown that macroinvertebrate herbivory likely facilitates vegetative
   propagation of the red alga through increased release and germination of
   carpospores and new gametophytes.},

Abstract = {The diversity of chondrychthyans in Mexico is described. The fauna is
   composed by 214 species (111 sharks, 95 rays and 8 chimaeras) and
   represents 17.3 \% of the total number of species recorded worldwide.
   The families with the highest diversity comprise: Rajidae (14.5 \%),
   Carcharhinidae (12.1 \%), Pentanchidae, Triakidae, and Urotrygonidae
   (5.1 \%). In terms of geographical distribution, the diversity on the
   Mexican Pacific slope reaches up to 56.1 \% of those species inhabiting
   Mexican marine and brackish waters (120 species, 62 genera, 37 families
   and 14 orders); the diversity in the Atlantic slope resulted similar to
   that on the Mexican Pacific with 55.1 \% of the species (118 species, 59
   genera, 35 families and 13 orders). The biogeographical affinities of
   the Mexican chondrychthyan fauna are complex with 19.7 \% of the species
   being circumglobal, 9.9 \% transatlantic, 1.9 \% transpacific, and 9.4
   \% endemic to the exclusive economic zone. Additionally, 36.6 \% of the
   species recorded so far are endemic to the Eastern Pacific coast where
   the species are similar to those found in the Cortez biogeographic
   province (27.7 \%), followed by the Californian (20.7 \%), Panamanian
   (19.3 \%), Galapagos (5.6 \%) and Peruvian-Chilean (8.9 \%). Likewise,
   33.3 \% are endemic of the Atlantic coast, where species are similar to
   those found in the Caribbean province (31.9 \%), followed by the
   Carolinean (24.4 \%) and the Brazilian (6.6 \%).},

Abstract = {Natural systems composed of closely related taxa that vary in the degree
   of phenotypic divergence and geographic isolation provide an opportunity
   to investigate the rate of phenotypic diversification and the relative
   roles of selection and drift in driving lineage formation. The genus
   Junco (Aves: Emberizidae) of North America includes parapatric northern
   forms that are markedly divergent in plumage pattern and colour, in
   contrast to geographically isolated southern populations in remote areas
   that show moderate phenotypic divergence. Here, we quantify patterns of
   phenotypic divergence in morphology and plumage colour and use
   mitochondrial DNA genes, a nuclear intron, and genomewide SNPs to
   reconstruct the demographic and evolutionary history of the genus to
   infer relative rates of evolutionary divergence among lineages. We found
   that geographically isolated populations have evolved independently for
   hundreds of thousands of years despite little differentiation in
   phenotype, in sharp contrast to phenotypically diverse northern forms,
   which have diversified within the last few thousand years as a result of
   the rapid postglacial recolonization of North America. SNP data resolved
   young northern lineages into reciprocally monophyletic lineages,
   indicating low rates of gene flow even among closely related parapatric
   forms, and suggesting a role for strong genetic drift or multifarious
   selection acting on multiple loci in driving lineage divergence. Juncos
   represent a compelling example of speciation in action, where the
   combined effects of historical and selective factors have produced one
   of the fastest cases of speciation known in vertebrates.},

   in systems in non-equilibrium conditions. Considering the generalized
   entropy, the corresponding flux and entropy production, and using the
   time fractional derivative, we have derived a space-time generalized
   telegrapher's equation with a fractional nested hierarchy which can be
   used in separate developments for the mass transport, for the heat
   conduction and for the flux of ions. We have obtained a new formalism
   which includes the contribution of fast of higher-order fluxes in the
   mesoscopic and inhomogeneous media. The results take the form of
   continued fraction expansions. The balance equations are used in a
   scheme of continued fractions, and they appear as a closure condition.
   In this way the transport equation and its corresponding wave
   number-frequency relation are obtained, both of them in the mathematical
   structure of the continued fraction scheme. Numerical examples are
   included to show the dispersive nature of the solutions, and the
   generalized fractional transport equation in the same mathematical form,
   which can be applied to the mass transport, the heat conduction and the
   flux of ions.},

Abstract = {We investigated intra-annual variability in acarine parasite load
   (species richness, prevalence and abundance) and spleen mass in
   populations of leaf-nosed bats in highly seasonal tropical and
   subtropical climates: one population of California leaf-nosed bat
   (Macrotus californicus) in a subtropical thorn forest, one population of
   Waterhouse's leaf-nosed bat (M. waterhousii) in a subtropical desert,
   and one population of Waterhouse's leaf-nosed bat in a tropical
   deciduous forest. We tested the hypothesis that hosts in highly seasonal
   tropical and subtropical climates exhibit significant seasonal changes
   in immune response and parasite load. Prevalence was 100\% in most
   populations examined, except in the subtropical population of M.
   waterhousii in the rainy season. The tropical population had the highest
   parasite richness in both seasons and presented species belonging to the
   four acarine orders examined: Mesostigmata, Ixodidae, Trombidiformes,
   and Sarcoptiformes. Abundance values of Trombidiformes in M.
   californicus, and of Ixodida and Sarcoptiformes in the tropical M.
   waterhousii population were higher in the rainy than in the dry season.
   Spleen mass was larger in the tropical population in the rainy season
   and in the subtropical population in the dry season. Spleen mass was not
   related to abundance of any of the acarine orders (Mesostigmata,
   Ixodidae, Trombidiformes, and Sarcoptiformes) analyzed. Our findings
   suggest that bats in highly seasonal tropical and subtropical
   environments experience significant seasonal changes in parasite burden
   and in immune response.},

Abstract = {DNA barcoding regions have been used for identifying organisms and
   delimiting species. Our research focused on butterflies belonging to the
   Enantia jethys species complex (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) in Mexico,
   specifically to resolve the taxonomic problem of the number of species
   in the group. We used the standard segment of approximately 650 base
   pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Our
   study is the first to use DNA sequences to examine phylogenetic
   relationships of this complex species. Three phylogenetic inference
   methods used were parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference.
   Two-species delimitation methods also were used: generalized mixed
   Yule-coalescent and Poisson tree process (bPTP). We used all the
   analyses to obtain 155 COI sequences and a persistent clade with four
   monophyletic groups: three corresponding to Enantia albania (Bates),
   Enantia jethys (Boisduval), and Enantia mazai Llorente, and a fourth
   corresponding to a new potential cryptic species, which must be

Title = {Polygenetic soils of montane cloud forest in Sierra Gorda, Mexico},

Volume = {7},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of the study was to fill the gap in the knowledge on soils of
   montane cloud forest: until recently the soils formed in base-rich
   parent material under this forest type were insufficiently studied. We
   provided pedogenetic analysis of soils of two localities under montane
   cloud forest ecosystems in Sierra Gorda Mountains, Quiretaro state,
   Mexico. The site San Agustin had the annual rainfall of about 3000 mm
   and more diverse vegetative community. Soils formed in the debris and
   colluviums of silicate shales. The soils at this site were classified as
   Umbric Alisol (Cutanic, Humic). The pedogenesis of these soils included
   the stage of accumulation of polymerized organic matter and illuviation
   of clay rich in organic C, followed by the stage of progressing
   hydroconsolidation. Current clay illuviation occurs mainly under the
   consolidated fragipan-like layer. The site Yerba Buena had the annual
   rainfall of about 1000 mm and less diverse vegetation. Soils formed in a
   mixture of silicate shale and lime-stone-derived materials. The soils at
   this site were classified as Albic Fragic Luvisol (Calcaric, Cutanic).
   Initially these soils underwent the stage of leaching of bases and
   simultaneous hydroconsolidation that resulted in the formation of fragic
   horizon. Currently clay illuviation can be detected in these soils, but
   the process is not very active due to the compaction of the EBx and Btx
   horizons and the presence of residual calcite in the BC horizon. Both
   Alisols and Luvisols are seldom reported in montane cloud forest: they
   form mainly in base-rich parent material. For Luvisols under this forest
   type carbonate-rich parent material seems to be a pre-requisite for
   their formation. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The heterotrophic origin of life proposed by A. I. Oparin in the 1920s
   was part of a Darwinian framework that assumed that living organisms
   were the historical outcome of a gradual transformation of lifeless
   matter. Eighty years ago, he presented a much more detailed scheme of
   the processes that may have led to life. As argued here, the development
   of the heterotrophic theory has been shaped by an entangled scenario in
   which a number of technical and scientific developments concur, as well
   as non-scientific issues including the Stalinist period and the tensions
   of the Cold War atmosphere. What has been largely ignored until now is
   the key role played by Haeckel's ideas in shaping Oparin's theory. The
   heterotrophic theory has been erroneously described as a
   metabolism-first hypothesis in which genetic material was not included
   due to ideological pressures of the Soviet government. As shown here,
   both characterizations are mistaken. The development of Oparin's views
   and the ensuing debates cannot be understood without considering the
   confrontation between Mendelism and Darwinism during the first three
   decades of the past century, combined with the doubts surrounding the
   existence of genes.},

Abstract = {A historical review of the genus Moschoneura Butler is described,
   highlighting some taxonomic problems prevailing for this genus. The
   diagnosis was based on morphological aspects of habitus, antennal club,
   male genitalia, and distributional aspects (ecological and
   geographical). When examining M. pinthous, M. ithomia, and M. ela
   species, the habitat preference of the latter is distinguished. The
   sulci and male genitalia of two species of the genus (M. pinthous monica
   and M. ela winhardi ssp. nov.) are illustrated. The distribution of the
   type localities of the taxa Moschoneura in the Andean region is plotted.
   While describing M. ela winhardi ssp. nov., a comparison was made with
   M. e. xanthella, and data of their habitat and habits are synthesized.},

Abstract = {We describe the spatial variation in the structure and composition of
   the communities of insects visiting the inflorescences of Flaveria
   ramosissima Klatt, Florestina pedata (Cav.) Cass., and Parthenium
   bipinnatifidum (Ort.) Rollins (Asteraceae) in a xeric environment in
   Central Mexico. Inflorescences of the three Asteraceae were visited by a
   total of 96 species of Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera,
   and Hemiptera. Total species richness of floral visitors to the three
   Asteraceae and total abundance of insects of Fl. pedata and P.
   bipinnatifidum did not differ between low and high vegetation cover
   sites. Total abundance of insects visiting the inflorescences of F.
   ramosissima and abundance of Hymenoptera in all three Asteraceae were
   higher at the low vegetation coverage (LVC) site than at the high
   vegetation coverage (HVC) one. Diversity of insects of Fl. pedata and P.
   bipinnatifidum was higher at the HVC site. However, in F. ramosissima
   diversity was higher at the LVC site. The communities of insects of each
   Asteraceae were dissimilar between sites. These differences can be
   attributed to variation in the abundance of Lepidophora (Diptera:
   Bombyliidae), Miridae (Hemiptera), Melyridae (Coleoptera), Tiphiidae
   (Hymenoptera), Myrmecocystus mexicanus Wesmael, and Dorymyrmex grandulus
   (Forel) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). The first three insect groups were
   sensitive to LVC, high temperature, and low humidity, whereas the last
   three tolerated those same environmental conditions. Changes in
   temperature, humidity, and resources associated with vegetation coverage
   seem to differentially affect each species of floral visitors of the
   three Asteraceae species studied.},

Abstract = {The tropical gar A. tropicus plays an important ecological role as it
   regulates other fish stocks in different water bodies in Southeastern
   Mexico. Nevertheless, wild populations are declining, and one
   conservation alternative is the aquaculture production and basic
   knowledge of reproductive biology; for males, this requires the study of
   germ and somatic structures of testes, to characterize the reproductive
   cycle, and to provide basic knowledge for exploitation and conservation
   models and strategies. With this aim, a total of 24 males with an
   average sL = 47.2 cm were collected from wild populations from the
   Laguna Pomposii, municipality of Jalpa de Mendez (18 degrees 19'- 93
   degrees 01'12 `' W), Tabasco, Mexico. Fish were collected with a trawl
   net and were transported live to the Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory,
   Division Academica de Ciencias Biologicas (DACBiol), Universidad Juarez
   Autonoma de Tabasco (UJAT). Males were killed by prolonged immersion in
   MS222. Testes samples were collected from each specimen and were
   processed using the standard histological procedures, that consisted of
   dehydration in an ascending ethanol series, xylol, embedding in
   paraffin, sectioning at 7 gm, and staining with hematoxylin-eosin (HE).
   The diameter of 20 seminiferous tubules (Dst), height of germinal
   epithelium (Hge), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonad volume (gV) were
   determined monthly. Based on morphometric and morpho-physiological
   characteristics, the testes consisted of a network of anastomosed
   tubules with non-restricted cystic spermatogenesis, and a permanent
   germinal epithelium. This is the first report of a permanent germinal
   epithelium in A. tropicus. Five reproductive classes were histologically
   identified: Class I Regressed; Class II Early Maturation; Class III Mid
   Maturation; Class IV Late Maturation; Class V Regression. Monthly GSI,
   gV and Dst values were lower in January and February, the testis showed
   spermatozoa remains and a regenerating discontinuous germinal
   epithelium. In March spermiogenesis increased and proliferation of
   spermatogonia decreased. Male tropical gar followed a seasonal
   reproductive cycle, indicated by the monthly variation of the
   reproductive classes and the reproductive season processes observed, and
   for which temperature and rainfall seem to stimulate reproductive
   activity and spermiation.},

Title = {Protected areas and spatial conservation priorities for endemic

Abstract = {AimTo evaluate the representativeness of the current network of
   protected areas (PAs) of one of the most threatened ecoregions in the
   world, the South American Gran Chaco, and determine priority
   conservation areas for endemic (and nearly endemic) terrestrial
   vertebrates of the region.
   LocationSouth America.
   MethodsWe identified all those amphibians, mammals and birds whose
   distributions were at least 70\% within the Gran Chaco. Then, we refined
   and corrected species' distributional ranges, first, using records from
   collections and expert knowledge, and second, by incorporating
   environmental and topographic data using a technique for range polygon
   refinement. Lastly, we used Zonation, a spatial conservation
   prioritization software, to evaluate representativeness of the current
   protected areas (PAs) network of the region and to define forest
   remnants to strategically expand PAs while maximizing the
   representativeness of the selected groups and considering human
   activities.
   ResultsCurrent PAs cover 9\% of the region and represent 9.1\% of the
   total distribution of endemic species. Considering our prioritization,
   increasing the coverage to 17\% to match the Aichi targets would
   substantially increase the representativeness of the PA network,
   covering on average more than 30\% of the ranges of all endemic species
   and 77\% of the distributions of threatened and DD endemic species.
   Main conclusionsOur results highlight that the need for well-informed
   decisions in the Gran Chaco is imperative. While the current PA network
   in the region ensures a very poor representation of endemic terrestrial
   vertebrates, opportunities to efficiently expand the PAs network are
   really high. This emphasizes the potential of complementarity-based
   systematic conservation planning tools as an essential support for
   conservation decisions. Given the great information gaps regarding
   biodiversity and human activities in the region, similar studies with
   updated data would improve conservation planning in the Gran Chaco in
   the future.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aging-associated, progressive,
   and irreversible lung disease of unknown etiology, elusive pathogenesis,
   and very limited therapeutic options. The hallmarks of IPF are aberrant
   activation of alveolar epithelial cells and accumulation of fibroblasts
   and myofibroblasts along with excessive production of extracellular
   matrix. The linkage of aging with this disorder is uncertain, but a
   number of changes associated with aging, including telomere attrition,
   cell senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction, have been revealed in
   IPF lungs. Also, aging seems to confer a profibrotic phenotype upon
   fibroblasts and to increase the severity of the fibrogenic response in
   non-IPF fibrotic lung disorders. Better knowledge of the
   pathophysiological mechanisms linking aging to IPF will advance
   understanding of its pathogenesis and may provide new therapeutic
   windows to treatment of this devastating disease.},

Journal = {CIENCIAS MARINAS},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Abundance estimates for the Antillean manatee, Trichechus manatus
   manatus, in the southern Gulf of Mexico are based on interviews,
   mortality reports, and opportunistic sightings. The lack of quantitative
   data is explained by the complexity of hard-to-access fluvial-lake
   systems, low water transparency, and the elusive behavior of manatees.
   Side-scan sonar is a promissory tool to detect and count manatees in
   fluvial systems. The Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (PCBR), in the
   coastal plain of Tabasco (Mexico), could play a key role in the regional
   conservation of manatees, but it is under constant pressure, especially
   from the oil and gas industry, and it is important to generate
   quantitative data for this area. The objective of this study was to
   quantify the relative abundance of manatees at 4 selected sites within
   PCBR and at 2 reference sites outside the reserve using side-scan sonar,
   as a basis for the long-term monitoring of the species and to determine
   the importance of the reserve for regional manatee conservation. We
   conducted 5 to 7 boat surveys on 10-km line transects along selected
   water courses and recorded 63 manatee sightings. Manatees occurred at
   all sampling sites and abundance increased upriver. The site with the
   highest mean abundance (5.17 +/- 1.9 manatees/10 km) was located at the
   southeastern end of PCBR. There was statistical difference among sites.
   The southeastern portion of Tabasco is a key region for manatee
   conservation and management in Mexico. PCBR is a key regional feature
   but it is necessary to define protection strategies within and beyond
   its southern limits.},

Abstract = {Since several reports have indicated that cholinesterases (ChE) type and
   distribution is species specific and that in some species there is a
   relationship among gender, size and ChE activities, characterization has
   been suggested. The aim of the present study was to characterize the ChE
   present in head and muscle of Gambusia yucatana (using selective
   substrates and inhibitors) and to find its relationship with total
   length or gender. Results indicated that the ChE present in G. yucatana
   is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with high sensitivity to BW284C51 and
   an atypical smaller Km with butyrylthiocholine. Scatterplots indicated
   that there is no linearity between total length and AChE in male or
   female wild mosquitofish. There were no sex differences in AChE
   activities. Results indicated significant differences between a single
   collection site in the Yucatan peninsula and depurated organisms. This
   study emphasized the importance of characterizing ChE before usage in
   biomonitoring.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and
   usually lethal disease associated with aging. However, the molecular
   mechanisms of the aging process that contribute to the pathogenesis of
   IPF have not been elucidated. IPF is characterized by abundant foci of
   highly active fibroblasts and myofibroblasts resistant to apoptosis.
   Remarkably, the role of aging in the autophagy activity of lung
   fibroblasts and its relationship with apoptosis, as adaptive responses,
   has not been evaluated previously in this disease. In the present study,
   we analyzed the dynamics of autophagy in primary lung fibroblasts from
   IPF compared to young and age-matched normal lung fibroblasts. Our
   results showed that aging contributes for a lower induction of autophagy
   on basal conditions and under starvation which is mediated by mTOR
   pathway activation. Treatment with rapamycin and PP242, that target the
   PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, modified starvation-induced autophagy
   and apoptosis in IPF fibroblasts. Interestingly, we found a persistent
   activation of this pathway under starvation that contributes to the
   apoptosis resistance in IPF fibroblasts. These findings indicate that
   aging affects adaptive responses to stress decreasing autophagy through
   activation of mTORC1 in lung fibroblasts. The activation of this pathway
   also contributes to the resistance to cell death in IPF lung
   fibroblasts.},

Abstract = {This study determined the presence of Bartonella species in sucking lice
   from hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus Say and Ord, at San Luis
   Potosi, Mexico. Louse specimens were processed for morphological
   identification and evaluated for Bartonella DNA. A single sucking louse
   species was found and identified as Hoplopleura hirsuta Ferris. DNA was
   extracted from 20 adults, and a 379-bp fragment of Bartonella citrate
   synthase (gltA) gene was amplified. Six lice (30\%) were positive for
   Bartonella DNA, and all sequences found belonged to Bartonella vinsonii
   Brenner et al. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a member of
   B. vinsonii complex associated with sucking lice.},

Abstract = {In the 1960s, advances in protein chemistry and molecular genetics
   provided new means for the study of biological evolution. Amino acid
   sequencing, nucleic acid hybridization, zone gel electrophoresis, and
   immunochemistry were some of the experimental techniques that brought
   about new perspectives to the study of the patterns and mechanisms of
   evolution. New concepts, such as the molecular evolutionary clock, and
   the discovery of unexpected molecular phenomena, like the presence of
   repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes, eventually led to the
   realization that evolution might occur at a different pace at the
   organismic and the molecular levels, and according to different
   mechanisms. These developments sparked important debates between
   defendants of the molecular and organismic approaches. The most vocal
   confrontations focused on the relation between primates and humans, and
   the neutral theory of molecular evolution. By the 1980s and 1990s, the
   construction of large protein and DNA sequences databases, and the
   development of computer-based statistical tools, facilitated the coming
   together of molecular and evolutionary biology. Although in its
   contemporary form the field of molecular evolution can be traced back to
   the last five decades, the field has deep roots in twentieth century
   experimental life sciences. For historians of science, the origins and
   consolidation of molecular evolution provide a privileged field for the
   study of scientific debates, the relation between technological advances
   and scientific knowledge, and the connection between science and broader
   social concerns.},

Abstract = {During the Holocene, most of the climatic variability in the tropics has
   manifested through changes in the precipitation regime. Although there
   is relatively a large amount of information on this climatic variability
   from the lowlands during this time period, little is known regarding the
   environmental variability in the middle elevations. Here we present
   evidence of environmental change from a lacustrine sedimentary record
   recovered from Lake Lacandin, a small shallow water body located in the
   middle elevations of Chiapas, Mexico. Through analyses of cladoceran
   assemblages and chemical properties of the sediments (concentrations of
   C, Ca, N, Rb, Sr, Ti, and Zr), we aimed to reconstruct local and
   regional environmental conditions during the last 4,000 years. Our
   results show a highly dynamic cladoceran community apparently associated
   with changes in the size of the lake, which although variable has been
   enlarging through the last 4,000 years. Geochemical evidence also
   suggests high variability in moisture availability overimposed on a
   general trend towards drier conditions. Whereas the growing lake size
   seems associated with decreasing insolation seasonality, the trend to
   drier regional climates corresponds to the well-known southward
   displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone through the Holocene.
   Although the regional climate has been deteriorating, the enlarging lake
   suggests a decreasing water deficit though time. This pattern is
   probably a result of increasing insolation during the dry season,
   causing advection of marine moisture that precipitates because of the
   steep elevation gradient. Our results highlight the intricate nature of
   the millennial scale environmental variability, and the potential role
   of the middle elevations for sheltering biodiversity through times of
   environmental hardship.},

Title = {Generic temporal features of performance rankings in sports and games},
Journal = {EPJ DATA SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Many complex phenomena, from trait selection in biological systems to
   hierarchy formation in social and economic entities, show signs of
   competition and heterogeneous performance in the temporal evolution of
   their components, which may eventually lead to stratified structures
   such as the worldwide wealth distribution. However, it is still unclear
   whether the road to hierarchical complexity is determined by the
   particularities of each phenomena, or if there are generic mechanisms of
   stratification common to many systems. Human sports and games, with
   their ( varied but simple) rules of competition and measures of
   performance, serve as an ideal test-bed to look for universal features
   of hierarchy formation. With this goal in mind, we analyse here the
   behaviour of performance rankings over time of players and teams for
   several sports and games, and find statistical regularities in the
   dynamics of ranks. Specifically the rank diversity, a measure of the
   number of elements occupying a given rank over a length of time, has the
   same functional form in sports and games as in languages, another system
   where competition is determined by the use or disuse of grammatical
   structures. We use a Gaussian random walk model to reproduce the rank
   diversity of the studied sports and games. We also discuss the relation
   between rank diversity and the cumulative rank distribution. Our results
   support the notion that hierarchical phenomena may be driven by the same
   underlying mechanisms of rank formation, regardless of the nature of
   their components. Moreover, such regularities can in principle be used
   to predict lifetimes of rank occupancy, thus increasing our ability to
   forecast stratification in the presence of competition.},

Abstract = {Beaucarnea olsonii is described and illustrated from tropical deciduous
   forests of SW Puebla, Mexico. The new species can be distinguished from
   other Beaucarnea species by its massively swollen base that abruptly
   tapers into slender branches, by its conspicuously long stigma, and by
   its pedicel articulation that occurs at 2/3 of the length of the pedicel
   below the flower. With this new addition, the total number of endemic
   species of Beaucarnea for Mexico increases to 10, making this country
   the greatest center of diversification and endemism for the genus. We
   also provide a distribution map and a conservation status recommendation
   for the new species, as well as a key to the Beaucarnea species of
   southern central Mexico.},

Title = {Uniqueness of the Fock quantization of scalar fields in a Bianchi I
   cosmology with unitary dynamics},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Number = {10},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {The Fock quantization of free scalar fields is subject to an infinite
   ambiguity when it comes to choosing a set of annihilation and creation
   operators, a choice that is equivalent to the determination of a vacuum
   state. In highly symmetric situations, this ambiguity can be removed by
   asking vacuum invariance under the symmetries of the system. Similarly,
   in stationary backgrounds, one can demand time-translation invariance
   plus positivity of the energy. However, in more general situations,
   additional criteria are needed. For the case of free (test) fields
   minimally coupled to a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology, it has been
   proven that the ambiguity is resolved by introducing the criterion of
   unitary implementability of the quantum dynamics, as an endomorphism in
   Fock space. This condition determines a specific separation of the time
   dependence of the field, so that this splits into a very precise
   background dependence and a genuine quantum evolution. Furthermore,
   together with the condition of vacuum invariance under the spatial
   Killing symmetries, unitarity of the dynamics selects a unique Fock
   representation for the canonical commutation relations, up to unitary
   equivalence. In this work, we generalize these results to anisotropic
   spacetimes with shear, which are therefore not conformally symmetric, by
   considering the case of a free scalar field in a Bianchi I cosmology.},

Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {We study the thermodynamics of flavor D7-branes embedded in an
   anisotropic black brane solution of type HB supergravity. The flavor
   branes undergo a phase transition between a `Minkowski embedding', in
   which they lie outside of the horizon, and a `black hole embedding', in
   which they fall into the horizon. This transition depends on the black
   hole temperature, its degree of anisotropy, and the mass of the flavor
   degrees of freedom. It happens either at a critical temperature or at a
   critical anisotropy. A general lesson we learn from this analysis is
   that the anisotropy, in this particular realization, induces similar
   effects as the temperature. In particular, increasing the anisotropy
   bends the branes more and more into the horizon. Moreover, we observe
   that the transition becomes smoother for higher anisotropies.},

Title = {A biodiversity hotspot losing its top predator: The challenge of jaguar
   conservation in the Atlantic Forest of South America},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {The jaguar is the top predator of the Atlantic Forest (AF), which is a
   highly threatened biodiversity hotspot that occurs in Brazil, Paraguay
   and Argentina. By combining data sets from 14 research groups across the
   region, we determine the population status of the jaguar and propose a
   spatial prioritization for conservation actions. About 85\% of the
   jaguar's habitat in the AF has been lost and only 7\% remains in good
   condition. Jaguars persist in around 2.8\% of the region, and live in
   very low densities in most of the areas. The population of jaguars in
   the AF is probably lower than 300 individuals scattered in small
   sub-populations. We identified seven Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs)
   and seven potential JCUs, and only three of these areas may have >= 50
   individuals. A connectivity analysis shows that most of the JCUs are
   isolated. Habitat loss and fragmentation were the major causes for
   jaguar decline, but human induced mortality is the main threat for the
   remaining population. We classified areas according to their
   contribution to jaguar conservation and we recommend management actions
   for each of them. The methodology in this study could be used for
   conservation planning of other carnivore species.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The quantification of total (TC), organic (OC), elemental carbon (EC),
   and OC/TC, EC/TC ratios is useful to determine the original sources of
   carbonaceous particles, so the importance of using appropriate standards
   is often crucial in atmospheric sciences, and the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST) offers good analytes. The Standard
   Reference Material (SRM) Urban Particulate Matter has a similar matrix
   as in the airborne aerosols of urban atmospheres and a well-known
   composition. The optimum quantification temperature analysis for carbon
   content of SRM 1648a and 1649b using a coulometric method (CM5300 and
   CM5014) is 500 degrees C for OC and 700 degrees C for TC. We also
   evaluated the repeatability and reproducibility provided by the
   instrument. It should be pointed out that SRM 1649b has no OC or TC
   quantification in its Certificate of Analysis, so this study may serve
   as a basis for future analysis of carbon content of atmospheric
   aerosols. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of slope aspect and topographic position on environmental
   variables, disturbance regime and tree community attributes in a
   seasonal tropical dry forest},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Questions: What is the magnitude of the differences in environment and
   chronic human disturbance between contrasting slope aspects and
   topographic positions in a seasonally dry tropical forest? What is the
   effect of such topography-related differences on composition, structure
   and diversity attributes of the tree community of this forest?
   Location: Tziritzicuaro, Michoacan State, southern Mexico.
   Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 36 100-m(2) plots evenly distributed
   among three topographic positions (lower, middle and upper parts of a
   slope) and two slope aspects (N- and S-facing). Environment at these
   sites was described through modelling incoming solar radiation and in
   situ recording of temperature during 1 yr. Disturbance was visually
   assessed in the field to calculate a Chronic Disturbance Index.
   Vegetation structure and diversity were compared among the resulting
   combinations of slope and topographic position. PERMANOVA and CCA were
   used to examine the multivariate relationship among vegetation,
   topography and disturbance.
   Results: Slope aspects and topographic positions differed in terms of
   annual mean temperature, potential energy income and evapotranspiration.
   Conversely, disturbance was not so clearly related to topography.
   Regarding vegetation structure, significant differences were only found
   for individual sizes and abundance; these values increased towards the
   upper portion of S-facing slopes, but decreased with elevation in
   N-facing slopes. Species diversity (S, Jacknife 1 and Fisher's alpha)
   was higher in S-facing slopes and increased from lower to upper
   topographic positions. PERMANOVA showed that vegetation structure and
   diversity were influenced by topographic position (12.9\%) and the
   interaction between soil moisture and chronic disturbance with slope
   aspect (8.2\% and 8.3\%, respectively). CCA showed that a modest
   proportion (21\%) of variation in species composition is explained by
   the combination of environmental and disturbance variables.
   Conclusions: Slope aspect and topographic position represent axes of
   environmental and disturbance differentiation. Although vegetation
   attributes respond to these ecological factors, they do not show
   homogeneous responses. Floristic composition is clearly linked to
   environmental heterogeneity, while structural attributes and
   alpha-diversity appear to be more closely related to human disturbance
   and soil moisture, particularly on S-facing slopes. Integrating
   environmental heterogeneity and human disturbance with topographic
   variability enhances our understanding of large variation in tree
   community attributes in seasonal dry tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Aim To assess the changes in the elevational distribution of 151
   butterfly species over a period of 22 years (1988-2011) and investigate
   whether these changes are related to regional global warming and land
   use change.
   Location Sierra de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.
   Methods Butterflies were surveyed at eight sites spanning elevations
   ranging from 117 m to 3000 m in 1988, and the same sites were resurveyed
   in 2010-2011. Changes in the elevational distribution of species and the
   structure and composition of species assemblages were compared between
   surveys. The results were interpreted in the context of land use and
   climate change in the region.
   Results Butterfly species had shifted their distributions uphill by
   approximately 145 m on average. Significantly more species (78) showed
   an uphill shift in their distributions than a downhill shift (32
   species). Species occurring above 1000 m elevation had shifted their
   distribution to an extent that matched the range shift expected under
   the recorded temperature changes. However, for species occurring below
   1000 m elevation, and for all species combined, uphill range shifts were
   significantly less than expected based solely on the increase in
   temperature. Land use change over the study period was more pronounced
   at low elevations, and these butterfly assemblages are now dominated by
   generalist species.
   Main conclusions Our results represent the first concrete evidence of
   shifts in elevation distribution of a large Neotropical butterfly
   community, attributable to increased regional temperatures. At high
   elevations, land use change is minimal and climate change appears to be
   the main driver of changes to distributions and assemblages, and the
   main conservation threat. However, extensive land use change has been
   the main driver of changes to butterfly communities at lower elevations.},

Title = {Shaping communicative colour signals over evolutionary time},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many evolutionary forces can shape the evolution of communicative
   signals, and the long-term impact of each force may depend on relative
   timing and magnitude. We use a phylogenetic analysis to infer the
   history of blue belly patches of Sceloporus lizards, and a detailed
   spectrophotometric analysis of four species to explore the specific
   forces shaping evolutionary change. We find that the ancestor of
   Sceloporus had blue patches. We then focus on four species; the first
   evolutionary shift (captured by comparison of S. merriami and S.
   siniferus) represents an ancient loss of the belly patch by S.
   siniferus, and the second evolutionary shift, bounded by S. undulatus
   and S. virgatus, represents a more recent loss of blue belly patch by S.
   virgatus. Conspicuousness measurements suggest that the species with the
   recent loss (S. virgatus) is the least conspicuous. Results for two
   other species (S. siniferus and S. merriami) suggest that over longer
   periods of evolutionary time, new signal colours have arisen which
   minimize absolute contrast with the habitat while maximizing
   conspicuousness to a lizard receiver. Specifically, males of the species
   representing an ancient loss of blue patch (S. siniferus) are more
   conspicuous than are females in the UV, whereas S. merriami males have
   evolved a green element that makes their belly patches highly sexually
   dimorphic but no more conspicuous than the white bellies of S. merriami
   females. Thus, our results suggest that natural selection may act more
   immediately to reduce conspicuousness, whereas sexual selection may have
   a more complex impact on communicative signals through the introduction
   of new colours.},

Abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an alteration in brain function, caused
   by an external force, which may be a hit on the skull, rapid
   acceleration or deceleration, penetration of an object, or shock waves
   from an explosion. Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of morbidity
   and mortality worldwide, with a high prevalence rate in pediatric
   patients, in which treatment options are still limited, not available at
   present neuroprotective drugs. Although the therapeutic management of
   these patients is varied and dependent on the severity of the injury,
   general techniques of drug types are handled, as well as physical and
   surgical. Baclofen is a muscle relaxant used to treat spasticity and
   improve mobility in patients with spinal cord injuries, relieving pain
   and muscle stiffness. Pharmacological support with baclofen is
   contradictory, because disruption of its oral administration may cause
   increased muscle tone syndrome and muscle spasm, prolonged seizures,
   hyperthermia, dysesthesia, hallucinations, or even multisystem organ
   failure. Combined treatments must consider the pathophysiology of
   broader alterations than only excitation/inhibition context, allowing
   the patient's reintegration with the greatest functionality.},

Abstract = {Animals rely on multimodal signals to obtain information from
   conspecifics through alternative sensory systems, and the evolutionary
   loss of a signal in one modality may lead to compensation through
   increased use of signals in an alternative modality. We investigated
   associations between chemical signaling and evolutionary loss of
   abdominal color patches in males of four species (two plain-bellied and
   two colorful-bellied) of Sceloporus lizards. We conducted field trials
   to compare behavioral responses of male lizards to swabs with femoral
   gland (FG) secretions from conspecific males and control swabs (clean
   paper). We also analyzed the volatile organic compound (VOC) composition
   of male FG secretions by stir bar extraction and gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) to test the hypothesis that loss of the visual
   signal is associated with elaboration of the chemical signal. Males of
   plain-bellied, but not colorful-bellied species exhibited different
   rates of visual displays when exposed to swabs of conspecific FG
   secretions relative to control swabs. The VOC composition of male
   Sceloporus FG secretions was similar across all four species, and no
   clear association between relative abundances of VOCs and evolutionary
   loss of abdominal color patches was observed. The emerging pattern is
   that behavioral responses to conspecific chemical signals are
   species-and context-specific in male Sceloporus, and compensatory
   changes in receivers, but not signalers may be involved in mediating
   increased responsiveness to chemical signals in males of plain-bellied
   species.},

Abstract = {Organisms belonging to the genus Rhizobium colonize leguminous plant
   roots and establish a mutually beneficial symbiosis. Biofilms are
   structured ecosystems in which microbes are embedded in a matrix of
   extracellular polymeric substances, and their development is a multistep
   process. The biofilm formation processes of R. etli CFN42 were analyzed
   at an early (24-h incubation) and mature stage (72 h), comparing cells
   in the biofilm with cells remaining in the planktonic stage. A
   genome-wide microarray analysis identified 498 differentially regulated
   genes, implying that expression of similar to 8.3 \% of the total R.
   etli gene content was altered during biofilm formation. In
   biofilms-attached cells, genes encoding proteins with diverse functions
   were over-expressed including genes involved in membrane synthesis,
   transport and chemotaxis, repression of flagellin synthesis, as well as
   surface components (particularly exopolysaccharides and
   lipopolysaccharides), in combination with the presence of activators or
   stimulators of N-acyl-homoserine lactone synthesis This suggests that R.
   etli is able to sense surrounding environmental conditions and
   accordingly regulate the transition from planktonic and biofilm growth.
   In contrast, planktonic cells differentially expressed genes associated
   with transport, motility (flagellar and twitching) and inhibition of
   exopolysaccharide synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report
   of nodulation and nitrogen assimilation-related genes being involved in
   biofilm formation in R. etli. These results contribute to the
   understanding of the physiological changes involved in biofilm formation
   by bacteria.},

Abstract = {Steroidal sapogenins have shown antiproliferative effects against
   several tumor cell lines; and their effects on human cancer cells are
   currently under study. Changes in the functionality on the steroidal
   structure make it possible to modify the biological activity of
   compounds. Herein, we report the synthesis and in vitro antitumor
   activity of two steroidal oxime compounds on cervical cancer cells.
   These derivatives were synthesized from the steroidal sapogenin
   diosgenin in good yields. The in vitro assays show that the steroidal
   oximes show significant antiproliferative activity compared to the one
   observed for diosgenin. Cell proliferation, cell death, and the
   cytotoxic effects were determined in both cervical cancer cells and
   human lymphocytes. The cancer cells showed apoptotic morphology and an
   increased presence of active caspase-3, providing the notion of a death
   pathway in the cell. Significantly, the steroidal oximes did not exert a
   cytotoxic effect on lymphocytes.},

Title = {Reasons for success: Rapid evolution for desiccation resistance and

Journal = {EVOLUTION},

Volume = {70},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Species that exhibit broad ranges of distribution may successfully
   navigate environmental changes by modifying some of their life-history
   traits. Environmental humidity imposes a critical stress that organisms
   may overcome by increasing their resistance to desiccation. We used
   experimental evolution to investigate adaptation to desiccation in the
   tephritid Anastrepha ludens, a species with high fecundity, late
   maturation, and long lifespan. We measured morphological, physiological,
   developmental as well as demographic changes involved in the adaptation
   to desiccation. Notwithstanding a low heritability (h(2) = 0.237),
   desiccation resistance evolved extremely rapidly and few negative
   trade-offs were detected. Selected flies exhibited correlated increases
   in longevity, body size, the amount of body lipids, and bulk water
   content, and in the duration of the pupal stage. Females further delayed
   sexual maturation, decreased daily fecundity but retained high lifetime
   reproductive potential. No differences in male mating competitiveness
   were found. Selected and control lines differed in longevity but not in
   total female fecundity, demonstrating that A. ludens flies have the
   capability for fast adaptation to desiccation without loosing their
   reproductive capability. Thus, it seems that a rapid evolutionary
   response to desiccation in this polyphagous insect works as a buffer for
   environmental variation and reduces the strength of selection on
   reproductive traits.},

Title = {Repeated evolution of viviparity in phrynosomatid lizards constrained
   interspecific diversification in some life-history traits},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In vertebrates, viviparity has evolved independently multiple times,
   apparently increasing morphological diversification and speciation rates
   as a consequence. We tested whether the evolution of viviparity has also
   increased diversification of life-history traits by estimating
   evolutionary rates of lizards from the North American family
   Phrynosomatidae. Using modern phylogenetic comparative methods, we
   compared these rates between oviparous and viviparous species, and found
   no support for this hypothesis. Instead, we found higher evolutionary
   rates for oviparous species in some life-history traits. Our results
   suggest that the evolution of viviparity may have constrained rather
   than facilitated evolution of life histories.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},

Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {We study the velocity statistics distribution of an external heavy
   particle in holographic fluids. We argue that when the dual supergravity
   background has a finite temperature horizon the velocity statistics goes
   generically as 1/v, compatible with the jet-quenching intuition from the
   quark-gluon plasma. A careful analysis of the behavior of the classical
   string whose apparent world sheet horizon deviates from the background
   horizon reveals that other regimes are possible. We numerically discuss
   two cases: the magnetized quark-gluon plasma and a model of super fluid
   flow. We explore a range of parameters in these top-down supergravity
   solutions including, respectively, the magnetic field and the super
   fluid velocity. We determine that the velocity statistics goes largely
   as 1/v, however, as we leave the non-relativistic regime we observe some
   deviations.},

Title = {The Effect of Chronic Ozone Exposure on the Activation of Endoplasmic
   Reticulum Stress and Apoptosis in Rat Hippocampus},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {The chronic exposure to low doses of ozone, like in environmental
   pollution, leads to a state of oxidative stress, which has been proposed
   to contribute to neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). It induces an increase of calcium in the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER), which produces ER stress. On the other hand, different
   studies show that, in diseases such as Alzheimer's, there exist
   disturbances in protein folding where ER plays an important role. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the state of chronic oxidative
   stress on ER stress and its relationship with apoptotic death in the
   hippocampus of rats exposed to low doses of ozone. We used 108 male
   Wistar rats randomly divided into five groups. The groups received one
   of the following treatments: (1) Control (air); (2) Ozone (03) 7 days;
   (3) 03 15 days; (4) 03 30 days; (5) 03 60 days; and (6) 03 90 days. Two
   hours after each treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the
   hippocampus was extracted. Afterwards, the tissue was processed for
   western blot and immunohistochemistry using the following antibodies:
   ATF6, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and caspase 12. It was
   also subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
   labeling (TUNEL) assay and electronic microscopy. Our results show an
   increase in ATF6, GRP78 and caspase 12 as well as ER ultrastructural
   alterations and an increase of TUNEL positive cells after 60 and 90 days
   of exposure to ozone. With the obtained results, we can conclude that
   oxidative stress induced by chronic exposure to low doses of ozone leads
   to ER stress. ER stress activates ATF6 inducing the increase of GRP78 in
   the cytoplasm, which leads to the increase in the nuclear translocation
   of ATF6. Finally, the translocation creates a vicious cycle that,
   together with the activation of the cascade for apoptotic cell death,
   contributes to the maintenance of ER stress. These events potentially
   contribute in the neurodegeneration processes in diseases like AD.},

Abstract = {The catalytic conversion of nitrous oxide (N2O) is of crucial
   environmental relevance because this chemical compound is a greenhouse
   gas with an important contribution to climate change, even larger than
   CO2 depleting the ozone layer. Recently, reduction of N2O catalyzed by
   rhodium subnanoclusters has been the subject of intensive research, both
   experimental and theoretical, finding dependencies of reaction rate on
   the size and geometry and electronic structure of the cluster. In this
   work, the catalytic reduction mechanism of N2O by Rh-6(-) and Rh-6(+)
   ionic clusters has been studied by means of density functional theory
   calculations within the zero order-regular approximation (ZORA), which
   explicitly includes relativistic effects. The N2O + Rh-6(-) and N2O +
   Rh-6(+) reaction pathways were approached starting from a comprehensive
   search of different stable adsorption modes; transition states were
   determined as well. We have obtained that the Rh-6(-) anions present the
   lowest activation barriers without spin selectivity. The N2O reduction
   pathway on the Rh-6(-) anion was more favorable that the simple
   desorption channel, whereas on Rh-6(+) both channels are in competition,
   as was experimentally observed. The N2O reduction on Rh-6(-) and Rh-6(+)
   is sensitive to the charge; it seems to be independent of geometry.},

Abstract = {Recent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy has
   demonstrated a total high spin ground state of S = 11/2 in the Cr-2(+)
   cluster. The accuracy of these experiments opens the possibility to
   observe small magnetic particles with greater detail than those obtained
   in Stern Gerlach setups. Particularly the chromium clusters, where a
   high total magnetization can be observed due to their localized
   d-electrons, are an excellent candidate to be detected in this
   sophisticated experiments. In this work, the small-sized chromium
   tetramer has been investigated in detail by means of zero and finite
   temperature ab initio methods. The dimer and trimer chromium clusters
   are reported as a benchmark in order to establish a reliable approach.
   We found the existence of a spin competition between a lower S = 1 and a
   higher S = 6 spin state in the Cr-4(+) cluster; both spin states are
   close in geometry, allowing a spin-flip due to an spin-orbit coupling
   mechanism.},

Abstract = {Electronic transport and wavefunction localization are two closely
   related phenomena, but their behavior in truly macroscopic aperiodic
   lattices is a non-widely addressed issue. We study in this article the
   electrical conductivity of generalized Fibonacci (GF) lattices through
   the Kubo-Greenwood formula, while the localization of electronic
   wavefunction is analyzed by means of the Lyapunov exponent and
   participation ratio (PR). For periodic chains, an analytical expression
   of the Lyapunov exponent is obtained. We have also developed for the
   first time a real space renormalization method to calculate the PR of
   macroscopic GF lattices described by tight-binding Hamiltonians.
   Moreover, we report a novel unified renormalization method for the
   Kubo-Greenwood formula applied to GF chains. For quasiperiodic lattices,
   the results reveal a power-law decay of the spectral averages for both
   PR and DC conductivity when the system length increases. In addition, we
   present a systematic analysis of the AC conductivity spectra observing
   truly large resonant peaks in comparison to the ballistic one. The
   electrical conductance of GF nanowires is also investigated. Finally,
   the results suggest that PR could not be proper for the analysis of
   critically localized states. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Origin of the effective mobility in non-linear active micro-rheology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {145},
Number = {13},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {The distinction between the damping coefficient and the effective
   non-linear mobility of driven particles in active micro-rheology of
   supercooled liquids is explained in terms of individual and collective
   dynamics. The effective mobility arises as a collective effect which
   gives insight into the energy landscape of the system. On the other
   hand, the damping coefficient is a constant that modulates the effect of
   external forces over the thermal energy which particles have at their
   disposition to perform Brownian motion. For long times, these thermal
   fluctuations become characterized in terms of an effective temperature
   that is a consequence of the dynamic coupling between kinetic and
   configurational degrees of freedom induced by the presence of the strong
   external force. The interplay between collective mobility and effective
   temperature allows to formulate a generalized Stokes-Einstein relation
   that may be used to determine the collective diffusion coefficient. The
   explicit relations we deduce reproduce simulation data remarkably well.

Abstract = {Benthic marine heterocytous cyanoprokaryotes of Mexico's tropical coast
   are being recognized as an important and conspicuous component of the
   supralittoral and intertidal zones usually described as an extreme and
   low diversity biotope. Although Kyrtuthrix has been reported from
   different coasts worldwide, its complex morphology has led to differing
   taxonomic interpretations and positioning. Ten marine supra and
   intertidal populations of Kyrtuthrix were analyzed using a detailed
   morphological approach, complemented with ecological and geographical
   information as well as DNA sequence data of the 16S rRNA gene and
   associated 16S-23S ITS. Kyrtuthrix huatulcensis is described as a new
   species, different from K. dalmatica Ercegovic and K. maculans (Gomont)
   Umezaki based primarily on morphological data. Our material has smaller
   dimensions in thalli, filaments, trichomes and cells, and possesses
   differences in qualitative characters as well. Our material is epilithic
   as in K. maculans but not endolithic as in K. dalmatica. The analysis of
   molecular data, mainly 16S rRNA gene sequence, show that this genus is
   within the Rivulariaceae clade, and outside of the Scytonemataceae
   clade. ITS secondary structure comparison with some of the closer
   representatives of Rivulariaceae shows considerable differences with
   these related genera. Based on the evidence gathered in this study,
   inclusion of Kyrtuthrix within the Rivulariaceae, rather than the
   Scytonemataceae, is fully supported.},

Title = {Distributional patterns of the Order Gomphales (Fungi: Basidiomycota) in
   Mexico},

Abstract = {The distribution and endemicity patterns of Gomphales in Mexico are
   analyzed here for the first time. Richness and corrected endemism were
   obtained from a dataset of 3,483 records for 97 species, using a
   cell-grid system of one degree per side. The central region of Mexico
   (Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Estado de Mexico states), which
   includes most of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre
   Oriental biogeographic provinces, had the highest richness values, but
   Mexican areas in the Pacific Coast (Jalisco and Michoacan states) and
   southeastern Mexico (Oaxaca and Chiapas states) had the most distinctive
   composition, as measured by the corrected endemism index. Two main
   distributional patterns were recovered: a) montane: at elevations above
   1000m on coniferous, pine-oak, oak and cloud forests, typified by the
   presence of species of Ramaria and Clavariadelphus, b) lowlands: at
   elevations below 1000m mainly in evergreen, rainforest and deciduous
   tropical forests characterized by the presence of four tropical species
   of Lentaria, two tropical species of Gomphus endemic to Mexico, and four
   tropical species of Phaeoclavulina. The eight species of Gomphales
   endemic to Mexico have very restricted distribution, mostly in
   non-protected areas, and are not considered under special protection
   programs. The present contribution delineates general patterns of
   distribution for the Gomphales, and documents its diversity and endemism
   in Mexico.},

Title = {Using Google Earth Surface Metrics to Predict Plant Species Richness in
   a Complex Landscape},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Google Earth provides a freely available, global mosaic of
   high-resolution imagery from different sensors that has become popular
   in environmental and ecological studies. However, such imagery lacks the
   near-infrared band often used in studying vegetation, thus its potential
   for estimating vegetation properties remains unclear. In this study, we
   assess the potential of Google Earth imagery to describe and predict
   vegetation attributes. Further, we compare it to the potential of SPOT
   imagery, which has additional spectral information. We measured basal
   area, vegetation height, crown cover, density of individuals, and
   species richness in 60 plots in the oak forests of a complex volcanic
   landscape in central Mexico. We modelled each vegetation attribute as a
   function of surface metrics derived from Google Earth and SPOT images,
   and selected the best-supported linear models from each source. Total
   species richness was the best-described and predicted variable: the best
   Google Earth-based model explained nearly as much variation in species
   richness as its SPOT counterpart (R-2 = 0.44 and 0.51, respectively).
   However, Google Earth metrics emerged as poor predictors of all
   remaining vegetation attributes, whilst SPOT metrics showed potential
   for predicting vegetation height. We conclude that Google Earth imagery
   can be used to estimate species richness in complex landscapes. As it is
   freely available, Google Earth can broaden the use of remote sensing by
   researchers and managers in low-income tropical countries where most
   biodiversity hotspots are found.},

Abstract = {One alternative to contribute to the reduction of the pressure on coral
   reef ecosystems brought about by an increasing demand for marine
   aquarium ornamentals is to improve and further develop the culture of
   desirable species for trade. Peppermint shrimp from the genus Lysmata
   are among the most intensively traded decapod in the trade and while
   several studies have been conducted to improve its culture, individuals
   obtained from culture facilities are generally paler than those
   collected from the wild. Because color is a fundamental component of the
   price tag on most marine ornamental live species, poorly colored animals
   command a lower price, reducing competitiveness. In this study, we
   evaluate the influence of tank background color (reflected light) on the
   morphological coloration change of Lysmata boggessi. In a 15-d
   experiment, 30 individuals were exposed either to reflected-red or white
   light and the relative change of coloration between initial and final
   moments was quantified with photography (RGB color model). At the end of
   the experimental period, shrimp exposed to red-reflected light presented
   a more intense red coloration than those exposed to white-reflected
   light. These results demonstrate that a simple change in background tank
   color can enhance shrimp external coloration. Such a cheap-to-implement
   procedure can support the culture of more colorful, hence more valuable
   ornamental shrimp that can compete with those captured from the wild.},

Title = {Oogenesis: From Oogonia to Ovulation in the Flagfish, Jordanella

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {We provide histological details of the development of oocytes in the
   cyprinodontid flagfish, Jordanella floridae. There are six stages of
   oogenesis: Oogonial proliferation, chromatin nucleolus, primary growth
   (previtellogenesis {[}PG]), secondary growth (vitellogenesis), oocyte
   maturation and ovulation. The ovarian lamellae are lined by a germinal
   epithelium composed of epithelial cells and scattered oogonia. During
   primary growth, the development of cortical alveoli and oil droplets,
   are initiated simultaneously. During secondary growth, yolk globules
   coalesce into a fluid mass. The full-grown oocyte contains a large
   globule of fluid yolk. The germinal vesicle is at the animal pole, and
   the cortical alveoli and oil droplets are located at the periphery. The
   disposition of oil droplets at the vegetal pole of the germinal vesicle
   during late secondary growth stage is a unique characteristic. The
   follicular cell layer is composed initially of a single layer of
   squamous cells during early PG which become columnar during early
   vitellogenesis. During primary and secondary growth stages, filaments
   develop among the follicular cells and also around the micropyle. The
   filaments are seen extending from the zona pellucida after ovulation.
   During ovulation, a space is evident between the oocyte and the zona
   pellucida. Asynchronous spawning activity is confirmed by the
   observation that, after ovulation, the ovarian lamellae contain
   follicles in both primary and secondary growth stages; in contrast, when
   the seasonal activity of oogenesis and spawning ends, after ovulation,
   the ovarian lamellae contain only follicles in the primary growth stage.

Abstract = {The canopy of forests has been considered ``the last biotic
   frontier,{''} and study of its elements is very important in explaining
   the global functionality in ecosystems. Epiphytic plants and arthropods
   are essential elements in canopy habitats, and their relationships have
   been studied in order to understand the high diversity in tropical
   forests. Nevertheless, there are few studies on this development in
   temperate forests. The arthropod community was studied during the rainy
   and dry seasons at two altitudes, and a total of 240 T. violacea plants
   of three sizes were collected from Abies religiosa and Quercus spp. host
   trees. A total of 163,043 arthropods were collected and about 200
   morphospecies identified. The highest abundance was obtained during the
   dry season, while high diversity was found during the rainy season.
   There was a significant effect of plant size, host trees and collecting
   season on abundance and diversity, and there were seasonal variations in
   community composition. The community hosted on A. religiosa epiphytes
   showed higher abundance and density than that of Quercus.},

Abstract = {We describe a new species of semiaquatic Anolis (A. purpuronectes) from
   the Chimalapas region of eastern Oaxaca and adjacent Veracruz, Mexico,
   and investigate its phylogenetic relationships with the closely related
   species A. barkeri to which the populations under investigation have
   previously been assigned to. Anolis barkeri and the new species appear
   to be allopatric, and differ primarily in male dewlap colour (red and
   orange in A. barkeri, pale purple in A. purpuronectes). A partitioned
   Bayesian analysis of the mitochondrial genes encoding ND1 (part), ND2,
   and the intervening tRNAs revealed that A. barkeri and A. purpuronectes
   are genetically distinct (uncorrected genetic distance between
   them=11.5\%), nested within the A. schiedii group as sister species, and
   most closely related to a clade composed of A. cymbops, A. milleri, and
   A. parvicirculatus.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The tribe Tigridieae (Iridoideae: Iridaceae) is a New World group with
   centres of diversity in Mexico and Andean South America. North America
   harbours 67 of the 172 species recognised within the tribe, 54 being
   endemic. Our aims were to identify areas of endemism of the North
   American Tigridieae using endemicity analysis (EA) and to infer their
   relationships using parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE). A data
   matrix with 2769 geographical records of Tigridieae was analysed. The EA
   allowed to identify six consensus areas of endemism in Mexico. The PAE
   resulted in one cladogram with four clades and the following five biotic
   components: northern Mexico, western Mexico, central Mexico, southern
   Mexico and central-southern Mexico. The richness analysis of these areas
   of endemism indicated that the greatest concentration of species is
   located in central Mexico, with 14 species in one grid-cell. Grid-cells
   with 12 species each were identified in low western Mexico, high western
   Mexico, southern Mexico and central-southern Mexico. This last area is
   characterised by the greatest endemism, including nine species. The
   formation of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt seems to have been a key
   element to explain the diversification of North American Tigridieae.},

Abstract = {The graph of a function f defined in some open set of the Euclidean
   space of dimension (p + q) is said to be a translation graph if f may be
   expressed as the sum of two independent functions I center dot and psi
   defined in open sets of the Euclidean spaces of dimension p and q,
   respectively. We obtain a useful expression for the mean curvature of
   the graph of f in terms of the Laplacian, the gradient of I center dot
   and psi as well as of the mean curvatures of their graphs. We study
   translation graphs having zero mean curvature, that is, minimal
   translation graphs, by imposing natural conditions on I center dot and
   psi, like harmonicity, minimality and eikonality (constant norm of the
   gradient), giving several examples as well as characterization results.},

Abstract = {It is suggested that dispersal and vicariance led to speciation in
   Mesoamerican taxa during the Pleistocene, as a consequence of climatic
   fluctuations and resulting range disjunctions, but few biogeographic
   studies have been developed to assess their relative roles. Based on a
   mitochondrial DNA dataset, we analyzed the evolutionary history of
   Turdus assimilis, a species distributed in Mesoamerica and northwestern
   South America. Phylogenetic patterns, divergence times, and
   biogeographic analyses suggest a South American ancestor for T.
   assimilis, which split from T. albicollis between 1.4 and 3.0 Ma ago.
   The analysis suggests the colonization of Mesoamerica and the Choc
   region by small numbers of founder individuals. Furthermore, genetic
   divergence, reciprocal monophyly, an ancient disjunction, and clear
   phenotypic differences suggest that the population from the Choc region,
   T. a. daguae, represents a separate species from T. assimilis.},

Abstract = {Mexican ornithology has seen a curious trajectory, beginning with
   remarkably well documented indigenous knowledge, progressing to colonial
   expeditions and intensive nineteenth-century exploration. The baton
   passed to collectors and scientists from the United States of America
   around the beginning of the twentieth century, and most recently to
   Mexican scientists. The documentation of Mexican bird diversity grew in
   each of these phases, but has now become a Mexican enterprise, thanks to
   the combined availability of information (both from within the country
   and that ``repatriated{''} from around the world) and funding (provided
   in largest part by the Mexican government). This evolutionary process of
   a science community is perhaps general and global, but with different
   phases emphasized in different countries, and at diverse points in the
   process.},

Title = {Rotavirus activates dendritic cells derived from umbilical cord blood
   monocytes},
Journal = {MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS},

Volume = {99},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute infectious diarrhea in human
   neonates and infants. However, the studies aimed at dissecting the
   anti-virus immune response have been mainly performed in adults.
   Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in innate and acquired immune
   responses. Therefore, it is very important to determine the response of
   neonatal and infant DCs to rotavirus and to compare it to the response
   of adult DCs. Thus, we determined the response of monocyte-derived DCs
   from umbilical cord blood (UCB) and adult peripheral blood (PB) to
   rotavirus in vitro. It was found that the rotavirus and its genome,
   composed of segmented doubled stranded RNA (dsRNA), induced the
   activation of neonatal DCs, as these cells up-regulated the levels of
   CD40, CD86, MHC II, TLR-3 and TLR-4, the production of cytokines IL-6,
   IL-12/23p40, IL-10, TGF-beta (but not of IL-12p70), and the message for
   TNF-alpha. and IFN-beta. This activation enabled the neonatal DCs to
   induce a strong proliferation of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells and the
   production of IFN-gamma. Moreover, neonatal DCs could be infected by
   rotavirus and sustain its replication. Neonatal DCs had a similar
   response as adult DCs towards rotavirus and its genome. However, adult
   DCs had a biased pro-inflammatory response compared to neonatal DCs,
   which showed a biased regulatory profile, as they produced higher levels
   of IL-10 and TGF-beta, and were less efficient in inducing a Th1 type
   response. So it can be concluded that rotavirus and its genome can
   induce the activation of neonatal DCs in spite of their tolerogenic
   bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fibroblast growth factor-1 attenuates TGF-β1-induced lung fibrosis},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive
   fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation, and extensive deposition of
   extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) belongs
   to the FGF family and has been shown to inhibit fibroblast collagen
   production and differentiation into myofibroblasts, and revert
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting TGF-beta signalling
   pathways. However, the precise role of FGF-1 in pulmonary fibrosis has
   not yet been elucidated. In this study, we explore the mechanisms
   underlying the anti-fibrogenic effect of FGF-1 in pulmonary fibrosis in
   vitro and in vivo by prolonged transient overexpression of FGF-1
   (AdFGF-1) and TGF-beta (AdTGF-beta) using adenoviral vectors. In vivo,
   FGF-1 overexpression markedly attenuated TGF-beta-induced pulmonary
   fibrosis in rat lungs when given both concomitantly, or delayed, by
   enhancing proliferation and hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells
   (AECs). AdFGF-1 also attenuated the TGF-beta 1 signalling pathway and
   induced FGFR1 expression in AECs. In vitro, AdFGF-1 prevented the
   increase in beta-SMA and the decrease in E-cadherin induced by
   AdTGF-beta 1 in normal human lung fibroblasts, primary human pulmonary
   AECs, and A549 cells. Concomitantly, AdTGF-beta 1-induced Smad2
   phosphorylation was significantly reduced by AdFGF-1 in both cell types.
   AdFGF-1 also attenuated the increase in TGF beta R1 protein and mRNA
   levels in fibroblasts. In AECs, AdFGF-1 decreased TGF beta R1 protein by
   favouring TGF beta R1 degradation through the caveolin-1/proteasome
   pathway. Furthermore, FGFR1 expression was increased in AECs, whereas it
   was decreased in fibroblasts. In serum of IPF patients, FGF-1 levels
   were increased compared to controls. Interestingly, FGF-1 expression was
   restricted to areas of AEC hyperplasia, but not beta-SMA-positive areas
   in IPF lung tissue. Our results demonstrate that FGF-1 may have
   preventative and therapeutic effects on TGF-beta 1-driven pulmonary
   fibrosis via inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation, inducing AEC
   proliferation, regulating TGF-beta 1 signalling by controlling TGF beta
   R1 expression and degradation, and regulating FGFR1 expression. Thus,
   modulating FGF-1 signalling represents a potential therapy for the
   treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Copyright (C) 2016 Pathological Society

Abstract = {Follicular atresia, a common process present in all mammals, involves
   apoptotic and autophagic cell death. However, the participation of
   paraptosis, a type of caspase-independent cell death, during follicular
   atresia is unknown. This study found swollen endoplasmic reticulum in
   the granulosa cells of adult Wistar rats. Calnexin was used as a marker
   of the endoplasmic reticulum at the ultrastructural and optical levels.
   The cells with swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum were negative to
   the TUNEL assay and active caspase-3 immunodetection, indicating that
   this swelling is not part of any apoptotic or autophagic process.
   Additionally, immunodetection of the CHOP protein was used as a marker
   of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and this confirmed the presence of the
   paraptosis process. These data suggest that paraptosis-like cell death
   is associated with the death of granulosa cells during follicular
   atresia in adult Wistar rats.},

Abstract = {We studied the effect of the repetition rate of laser pulses (RRLP) in
   the range from 1-10 Hz in the production of silver nanoparticles
   (Ag-NPs) by laser ablation in ethanol. Laser pulses with a duration of 7
   ns, a wavelength of 1064 nm and an energy of 60 mJ were used to ablate a
   99.99\% pure silver target immersed in 10 ml of ethanol. Transmittance
   analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy were used to study the
   silver concentration in the colloidal solutions. The ablation process
   was studied by measuring the transmission of the laser pulses through
   the colloid. It is shown that for a fixed number of laser pulses (NLP)
   the ablation efficiency, in terms of the ablated silver mass per laser
   pulse, increases with the RRLP. This result contradicts what had
   previously been established in the literature.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Pollen transport by water-flow (hydrophily) is a typical, and almost
   exclusive, adaptation of plants to life in the marine environment. It is
   thought that, unlike terrestrial environments, animals are not involved
   in pollination in the sea. The male flowers of the tropical marine
   angiosperm Thalassia testudinum open-up and release pollen in mucilage
   at night when invertebrate fauna is active. Here we present experimental
   evidence that, in the absence of water-flow, these invertebrates visit
   the flowers, carry and transfer mucilage mass with embedded pollen from
   the male flowers to the stigmas of the female flowers. Pollen tubes are
   formed on the stigmas, indicating that pollination is successful. Thus,
   T. testudinum has mixed abiotic-biotic pollination. We propose a
   zoobenthophilous pollination syndrome (pollen transfer in the benthic
   zone by invertebrate animals) which shares many characteristics with
   hydrophily, but flowers are expected to open-up during the night.},

Title = {The complex evolutionary history of the tympanic middle ear in frogs and
   toads (Anura)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Most anurans possess a tympanic middle ear (TME) that transmits sound
   waves to the inner ear; however, numerous species lack some or all TME
   components. To understand the evolution of these structures, we
   undertook a comprehensive assessment of their occurrence across anurans
   and performed ancestral character state reconstructions. Our analysis
   indicates that the TME was completely lost at least 38 independent times
   in Anura. The inferred evolutionary history of the TME is exceptionally
   complex in true toads (Bufonidae), where it was lost in the most recent
   common ancestor, preceding a radiation of >150 earless species.
   Following that initial loss, independent regains of some or all TME
   structures were inferred within two minor clades and in a radiation of
   >400 species. The reappearance of the TME in the latter clade was
   followed by at least 10 losses of the entire TME. The many losses and
   gains of the TME in anurans is unparalleled among tetrapods. Our results
   show that anurans, and especially bufonid toads, are an excellent model
   to study the behavioural correlates of earlessness, extratympanic sound
   pathways, and the genetic and developmental mechanisms that underlie the
   morphogenesis of TME structures.},

Abstract = {Magnacarina gen. nov. from Mexico is described. Hapalopus aldanus West,
   2000 from Nayarit, is transferred to the new genus with an emended
   diagnosis creating the new combination Magnacarina aldana comb. nov.
   Three new species are described: Magnacarina moderata Locht, Mendoza \&
   Medina sp. nov. from Nayarit and Sinaloa; Magnacarina primaverensis
   Mendoza \& Locht sp. nov. and Magnacarina cancer Mendoza \& Locht sp.
   nov., both from Jalisco. Magnacarina gen. nov. is characterized by an
   unusual bifid palpal bulb, and has a primary projection located in the
   central area of the palpal bulb and directed retrolaterally; this
   projection possesses the prolateral superior and retrolateral keels.
   Next to the primary projection is a secondary projection, which may be
   short or long, ending in the prolateral inferior and apical keel
   surrounding the sperm pore. This secondary projection may have
   prolateral accessory keels and is diagnosed by possessing a nodule of
   inwardly curled megaspines, located in the basal ventro-retrolateral
   region of metatarsi I in adult males. Additionally, male tibiae I
   possess three apophyses. Females of Magnacarina gen. nov. have a single
   reduced and strongly sclerotized spermatheca, with an apical lobe
   projecting ventrally, and with a uterus externus that is longer and
   wider than the spermatheca.},

Title = {Beyond Zipf's Law: The Lavalette Rank Function and Its Properties},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Although Zipf's law is widespread in natural and social data, one often
   encounters situations where one or both ends of the ranked data deviate
   from the power-law function. Previously we proposed the Beta rank
   function to improve the fitting of data which does not follow a perfect
   Zipf's law. Here we show that when the two parameters in the Beta rank
   function have the same value, the Lavalette rank function, the
   probability density function can be derived analytically. We also show
   both computationally and analytically that Lavalette distribution is
   approximately equal, though not identical, to the lognormal
   distribution. We illustrate the utility of Lavalette rank function in
   several datasets. We also address three analysis issues on the
   statistical testing of Lavalette fitting function, comparison between
   Zipf's law and lognormal distribution through Lavalette function, and
   comparison between lognormal distribution and Lavalette distribution.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the morphology and
   expression of progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms in different cell
   subpopulations of the magnum region of the left oviduct of mature laying
   and aged nonlaying hens through histomorphometric and immunohistological
   methods. Histological results demonstrated several changes in the
   oviduct magnum of mature and aged hens, mainly in the mucosal tissue.
   Immunohistochemical analysis showed that both PR isoforms are expressed
   in all cell types of the oviduct magnum of mature laying hens. In
   contrast, in each cell type of the oviduct magnum of aged nonlaying hens
   only one PR isoform (PR-A or PR-B) was expressed. The results indicate
   that PR percentage and the PR-A and PR-B ratio change according to the
   cell type of the oviduct magnum and in an age-specific manner, and
   suggest that these variations contribute to the regulation of
   progesterone actions in the oviduct magnum with the normal aging of the
   animal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We describe the Mesoamerican leaf litter weevil genus Plumolepilius
   Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new genus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae:
   Molytinae: Conotrachelini) (type species P. trifiniensis Barrios-Izas \&
   Anderson, new species), species of which inhabit mountain ecosystems
   from the state of Chiapas in southeastern Mexico to northern Panama. In
   this paper we describe nine new species from Mexico, Guatemala, and El
   Salvador: P. trifiniensis Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new species (El
   Salvador and Guatemala); P. branstetteri Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new
   species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. longinoi Barrios-Izas \& Anderson,
   new species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. cortezi Barrios-Izas \& Anderson,
   new species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. canoi Barrios-Izas \& Anderson,
   new species (Guatemala); P. schusteri Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new
   species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. daryi Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new
   species (Guatemala); P. yolnabajensis Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new
   species (Guatemala); and P. macalajauensis Barrios-Izas \& Anderson, new
   species (Guatemala).
   The genus and the species are named and described, information on their
   geographical distributions is given and images of the habitus of both
   sexes and the aedeagus are presented. A key to the species of
   Plumolepilius based on males is included.
   The monophyly of Plumolepilius was confirmed by a parsimony analysis of
   external and male aedeagus morphology and the genus is best
   characterized by the presence of plumose scales lining the prosternal
   channel. Phylogenetic analysis supports that Lepilius Champion 1905 is
   the sister genus of Plumolepilius.},

Abstract = {A kernel N of a digraph D is an independent set of vertices of D such
   that for every w is an element of V(D)\textbackslash{}N there exists an
   arc from w to N. The digraph D is said to be a kernel-perfect digraph
   when every induced subdigraph of D has a kernel. Minimal non
   kernel-perfect digraphs are called critical kernel-imperfect digraphs.
   The broader sufficient condition for the existence of kernels in
   digraphs known so far is that states: (1) If D is a digraph such that
   every odd cycle has two consecutive poles, then D is kernel-perfect.
   In this paper is studied the structure of critical kernel-imperfect
   digraphs which belong to a very large special classes of digraphs and
   many structural properties are obtained. As a consequence (1) is widely
   generalized in this class of digraphs, where the condition of the poles
   is requested only for odd cycles whose edges alternate in a set of arcs.
   As consequence, some classic results of kernel-perfect and finite
   critical kernel-imperfect digraphs are generalized for these classes of
   digraphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The natural extension of the concept of perfection in graphs to
   hypergraphs is to define a uniform rn-hypergraph, H, as perfect, if it
   satisfies that for every subhypergraph H', chi (H') = {[}omega(H')/m-1],
   where chi (H') and omega(H') are the chromatic and clique number of H',
   respectively.
   It is known that comparability graphs are perfect. In this paper we
   introduce the concept of comparability 3-hypergraphs (those that can be
   transitively oriented) with the aim of proving that these are not
   perfect according to the natural definition. More explicitly, we exhibit
   three different subfamilies of comparability 3-hypergraphs which show
   different behaviors in respect to the relationship between the chromatic
   number and the clique number. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In this work an experimental investigation was carried out to study the
   effect that positron range has over positron emission tomography (PET)
   scans through measurements of the line spread function (LSF) in
   tissue-equivalent materials. Line-sources consisted of thin capillary
   tubes filled with F-18, N-13 or Ga-68 water-solution inserted along the
   axis of symmetry of cylindrical phantoms constructed with the
   tissue-equivalent materials: lung (inhale and exhale), adipose tissue,
   solid water, trabecular and cortical bone. PET scans were performed with
   a commercial small-animal PET scanner and image reconstruction was
   carried out with filtered-backprojection. Line-source distributions were
   analyzed using radial profiles taken on axial slices from which the
   spatial resolution was determined through the full-width at
   half-maximum, tenth-maximum, twentieth-maximum and fiftieth-maximum. A
   double-Gaussian model of the LSFs was used to fit experimental data
   which can be incorporated into iterative reconstruction methods. In
   addition, the maximum activity concentration in the line-sources was
   determined from reconstructed images and compared to the known values
   for each case. The experimental data indicates that positron range in
   different materials has a strong effect on both spatial resolution and
   activity concentration quantification in PET scans. Consequently, extra
   care should be taken when computing standard-uptake values in PET scans,
   in particular when the radiopharmaceutical is taken up by different
   tissues in the body, and more even so with high-energy positron
   emitters.},

Title = {Digital Accessible Knowledge and well-inventoried sites for birds in
   Mexico: baseline sites for measuring faunistic change},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Background. Faunal change is a basic and fundamental element in ecology,
   biogeography, and conservation biology, yet vanishingly few detailed
   studies have documented such changes rigorously over decadal time
   scales. This study responds to that gap in knowledge, providing a
   detailed analysis of Digital Accessible Knowledge of the birds of
   Mexico, designed to marshal DAK to identify sites that were sampled and
   inventoried rigorously prior to the beginning of major global climate
   change (1980).
   Methods. We accumulated DAK records for Mexican birds from all relevant
   online biodiversity data portals. After extensive cleaning steps, we
   calculated completeness indices for each 0.05 degrees pixel across the
   country; we also detected `hotspots' of sampling, and calculated
   completeness indices for these broader areas as well. Sites were
   designated as well-sampled if they had completeness indices above 80\%
   and > 200 associated DAK records.
   Results. We identified 100 individual pixels and 20 broader `hotspots'
   of sampling that were demonstrably well-inventoried prior to 1980. These
   sites are catalogued and documented to promote and enable resurvey
   efforts that can document events of avifaunal change (and non-change)
   across the country on decadal time scales.
   Conclusions. Development of repeated surveys for many sites across
   Mexico, and particularly for sites for which historical surveys document
   their avifaunas prior to major climate change processes, would pay rich
   rewards in information about distributional dynamics of Mexican birds.},

Abstract = {DNA barcoding was intended as a means to provide species-level
   identifications through associating DNA sequences from unknown specimens
   to those from curated reference specimens. Although barcodes were not
   designed for phylogenetics, they can be beneficial to the completion of
   the Tree of Life. The barcode database for Trichoptera is relatively
   comprehensive, with data from every family, approximately two-thirds of
   the genera, and one-third of the described species. Most Trichoptera, as
   with most of life's species, have never been subjected to any formal
   phylogenetic analysis. Here, we present a phylogeny with over 16 000
   unique haplotypes as a working hypothesis that can be updated as our
   estimates improve. We suggest a strategy of implementing constrained
   tree searches, which allow larger datasets to dictate the backbone
   phylogeny, while the barcode data fill out the tips of the tree. We also
   discuss how this phylogeny could be used to focus taxonomic attention on
   ambiguous species boundaries and hidden biodiversity. We suggest that
   systematists continue to differentiate between `Barcode Index Numbers'
   (BINs) and `species' that have been formally described. Each has
   utility, but they are not synonyms. We highlight examples of integrative
   taxonomy, using both barcodes and morphology for species description.

Title = {Morphological Development of the Structures Related to Annualism in the

Abstract = {Ovaries of five females of the annual fish teleost species Millerichthys
   robustus were processed, and the development of the cortical alveoli,
   zona pellucida and secondary envelope during oogenesis were described.
   We also documented the origin of the cortical alveoli in time and space
   similar to the Balbiani body; the synthesis of three generations of
   cortical alveoli and an active zona pellucida prior to vitellogenesis,
   which is implicated in the entry of oils to the interior of the oocyte.
   We found that in this species, the diameter of the alveoli is greater
   than in the other teleost fish species reported in the literature,
   except for Fundulus heteroclitus, in which the diameter is similar. The
   thickness of the zona pellucida recorded in M. robustus is the greatest
   reported to date. Likewise, two periods of secondary envelope deposition
   were documented: filaments during pre-vitellogenesis and, subsequently,
   trapeze-shaped projections during the maturation of the oocytes. We
   report about development of structures that are considered key for the
   survival of embryos in annual fish during the long periods of diapause
   in their extreme habitats. The development of peripheral structures
   described here probably reflects the changes in the physiology of the
   oocytes in M. robustus. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {We modeled the potential distribution of plant species that grow on the
   beaches and dunes of the Mexican Atlantic coast in order to identify
   areas of high biodiversity. We used environmental layers in combination
   with georeferenced data, utilizing the MaxEnt algorithm, and produced
   four regional consensus maps according to the geographic distribution of
   the species: along the entire Mexican Atlantic coast, the Gulf of
   Mexico; the Yucatan Peninsula and all species combined together on a
   single map. The largest number of widely distributed species in the Gulf
   of Mexico was concentrated in the northern and central regions, while
   biodiversity on the Yucatan Peninsula was likely to be concentrated in
   the north and on Cozumel island, which is the biggest island in the
   Mexican Caribbean. The map combining all species together revealed a
   potential concurrence of species in the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan
   Peninsula transition, where climatic characteristics converge within a
   small geographic area. In order to conserve beach and coastal dune plant
   biodiversity, special attention must be paid to the management plans of
   established protected areas and to the promotion of new protected areas
   consistent with the areas reported in this study, particularly in the
   central Gulf of Mexico and northern Yucatan Peninsula, where areas under
   protection are currently scarce. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {We describe and compare the chorionic architecture of three species,
   belonging to less derivative Coliadinae genera: Nathalis plauta
   (Doubleday, 1847), N. i. iole (Boisduval, 1836), and Kricogonia lyside
   (Godart, 1819). Such selection constitutes a refinement from previous
   studies of the chorion within this group, recognizing the presence of
   microreticulum in all three species. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   is incorporated with the previous staining technique, enriching the
   description and analysis of the chorionic architecture in the apical,
   equatorial, and basal regions. We typify two kinds of hexagonal
   macroreticulum and two kinds of rectangular macroreticulum; an
   intermediate state between the two is identified by the concept of
   `zig-zagging' axis, with taxonomic and phylogenetic implications. The
   overall results have implications for systematics of Coliadinae with
   aspects in classification and biogeography.},

Abstract = {The Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS) of southern Mexico is known for its
   exceptionally high levels of amphibian endemism, but knowledge of
   species' ranges in the region is incomplete. Here, we report new
   locality records for Eleutherodactylus syristes (Hoyt, 1965) from the
   states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. Previously, this species was known only
   from the Pacific slopes of the Sierra de Miahuatlan and Mixteca Alta in
   Oaxaca. These new occurrence records extend the known range of this
   species by approximately 335 km from the type locality and increase the
   elevational range, indicating it is more widespread in the SMS.
   Eleutherodactylus syristes is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN
   based on its limited distribution and ongoing threats to its

Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {363},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression without
   concomitant changes in DNA sequence. Due to its relevance in
   development, differentiation and human health, epigenetics has recently
   become an emerging area of science with regard to eukaryotic organisms
   and has shown enormous potential in synthetic biology. However,
   significant examples of epigenetic regulation in bacterial synthetic
   biology have not yet been reported. In the current study, we present the
   first model of such an epigenetic circuit. We termed the circuit the
   alternator circuit because parental cells carrying this circuit and
   their progeny alternate between distinct and heritable cellular fates
   without undergoing changes in genome sequence. Furthermore, we
   demonstrated that the alternator circuit exhibits hysteresis because its
   output depends not only on its present state but also on its previous
   states.},

Title = {Overview of the interactive task in BioCreative V},
Journal = {DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION},
Year = {2016},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Fully automated text mining (TM) systems promote efficient literature
   searching, retrieval, and review but are not sufficient to produce
   ready-to-consume curated documents. These systems are not meant to
   replace biocurators, but instead to assist them in one or more
   literature curation steps. To do so, the user interface is an important
   aspect that needs to be considered for tool adoption. The BioCreative
   Interactive task (IAT) is a track designed for exploring user-system
   interactions, promoting development of useful TM tools, and providing a
   communication channel between the biocuration and the TM communities. In
   BioCreative V, the IAT track followed a format similar to previous
   interactive tracks, where the utility and usability of TM tools, as well
   as the generation of use cases, have been the focal points. The proposed
   curation tasks are user-centric and formally evaluated by biocurators.
   In BioCreative V IAT, seven TM systems and 43 biocurators participated.
   Two levels of user participation were offered to broaden curator
   involvement and obtain more feedback on usability aspects. The full
   level participation involved training on the system, curation of a set
   of documents with and without TM assistance, tracking of time-on-task,
   and completion of a user survey. The partial level participation was
   designed to focus on usability aspects of the interface and not the
   performance per se. In this case, biocurators navigated the system by
   performing pre-designed tasks and then were asked whether they were able
   to achieve the task and the level of difficulty in completing the task.
   In this manuscript, we describe the development of the interactive task,
   from planning to execution and discuss major findings for the systems
   tested.},

Abstract = {The significance of experiments that claim to simulate the properties of
   prebiotic small peptides and polypeptides as models of the polymers that
   may have preceded proteins is critically addressed. As discussed here,
   most of these experiments are based only on a small number of a larger
   set of amino acids that may have been present in the prebiotic
   environment, supported by both experimental simulations and the
   repertoire of organic compounds reported in carbonaceous chondrites.
   Model experiments with small peptides may offer some insights into the
   processes that contributed to generate the chemical environment leading
   to the emergence of informational oligomers, but not to the origin of
   proteins. The large body of circumstantial evidence indicating that
   catalytic RNA played a key role in the origin of protein synthesis
   during the early stages of cellular evolution implies that the emergence
   of the genetic code and of protein biosynthesis are no longer synonymous
   with the origin of life. Hence, reports on the abiotic synthesis of
   small catalytic peptides under potential prebiotic conditions do not
   provide information on the origin of triplet encoded protein
   biosynthesis, but in some cases may serve as models to understand the
   properties of the earliest proteins.},

Title = {Novel Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-g-vinyl alcohol) Polyurethane Scaffold for
   Tissue Engineering},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {The design of new synthetic grafted poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) as composite
   3D-scaffolds is a convenient alternative for tissue engineering
   applications. The chemically modified poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is
   receiving increasing attention for use as biomimetic copolymers for cell
   growth. As of yet, these copolymers cannot be used efficiently because
   of the lack of good mechanical properties. Here, we address this
   challenge, preparing a composite-scaffold of grafted
   poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) polyurethane for the first time. However, it is
   unclear if the composite structure and morphology can also offer a
   biological application. We obtained the polyurethane by mixing a
   polyester hydroxylated resin with polyisocyanate and the modified
   polyhydroxyalkanoates. The results show that the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)
   grafted with poly(vinyl alcohol) can be successfully used as a chain
   extender to form a chemically-crosslinked thermosetting polymer.
   Furthermore, we show a proposal for the mechanism of the polyurethane
   synthesis, the analysis of its morphology and the ability of the
   scaffolds for growing mammalian cells. We demonstrated that astrocytes
   isolated from mouse cerebellum, and HEK293 can be cultured in the
   prepared material, and express efficiently fluorescent proteins by
   adenoviral transduction. We also tested the metabolism of Ca2+ to obtain
   evidence of the biological activity.},

Abstract = {The American Catopsilias are pierids, commonly known as sulphurs. These
   butterflies were grouped based on morphology and secondary sexual
   characters of the male, but this grouping was not taxonomically
   established. In Catopsilia were included genera such as Anteos,
   Aphrissa, Rhabdodryas, and Phoebis. Aphrissa is a genus taxonomically
   stable, but its phylogenetic position within Coliadinae is not clear. In
   this research, we used morphological data to establish the phylogenetic
   position of the genus Aphrissa and its phylogenetic relationships within
   the ancient American Catopsilias. We included four outgroups: Colias,
   Zerene, Eurema and Kricogonia. A maximum parsimony analysis was employed
   under equal and implied weights. We used 32 morphological characters, 18
   were coded as binary and 14 as multistate. A well-resolved cladogram was
   obtained. The American Catopsilias are not a monophyletic group. The
   analyses support the following relationships, clade A: Eurema + (Anteos
   + (Colias + Zerene) and clade B: Prestonia + (Aphrissa + (Rhabdodryas +
   Phoebis)). Kricogonia remained as the sister taxon of the whole group.
   Characters that support clade A include the morphology of male
   genitalia, while the clade B is supported by female genitalia and
   morphology of the chorion.},

Abstract = {We study a tripartite system of coupled spins, where a first set of one
   or two spins is our central system which is coupled to another set
   considered, the near environment, in turn coupled to the third set, the
   far environment. The dynamics considered are those of a generalized
   kicked spin chain in the regime of quantum chaotic dynamics. This allows
   us to test recent results that suggest that the presence of a far
   environment, coupled to the near environment, slows decoherence of the
   central system. After an extensive numerical study, we confirm previous
   results for extreme values and special cases. In particular, under a
   wide variety of circumstances an increasing coupling between near and
   far environment, slows decoherence, as measured by purity, and protects
   internal entanglement.},

Title = {Conserved form and function of the germinal epithelium through 500
   million years of vertebrate evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {277},
Number = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The germinal epithelium, i.e., the site of germ cell production in males
   and females, has maintained a constant form and function throughout 500
   million years of vertebrate evolution. The distinguishing characteristic
   of germinal epithelia among all vertebrates, males, and females, is the
   presence of germ cells among somatic epithelial cells. The somatic
   epithelial cells, Sertoli cells in males or follicle (granulosa) cells
   in females, encompass and isolate germ cells. Morphology of all
   vertebrate germinal epithelia conforms to the standard definition of an
   epithelium: epithelial cells are interconnected, border a body surface
   or lumen, are avascular and are supported by a basement membrane.
   Variation in morphology of gonads, which develop from the germinal
   epithelium, is correlated with the evolution of reproductive modes. In
   hagfishes, lampreys, and elasmobranchs, the germinal epithelia of males
   produce spermatocysts. A major rearrangement of testis morphology
   diagnoses osteichthyans: the spermatocysts are arranged in tubules or
   lobules. In protogynous (female to male) sex reversal in teleost fishes,
   female germinal epithelial cells (prefollicle cells) and oogonia
   transform into the first male somatic cells (Sertoli cells) and
   spermatogonia in the developing testis lobules. This common origin of
   cell types from the germinal epithelium in fishes with protogynous sex
   reversal supports the homology of Sertoli cells and follicle cells.
   Spermatogenesis in amphibians develops within spermatocysts in testis
   lobules. In amniotes vertebrates, the testis is composed of seminiferous
   tubules wherein spermatogenesis occurs radially. Emerging research
   indicates that some mammals do not have lifetime determinate fecundity.
   The fact emerged that germinal epithelia occur in the gonads of all
   vertebrates examined herein of both sexes and has the same form and
   function across all vertebrate taxa. Continued study of the form and
   function of the germinal epithelium in vertebrates will increasingly
   clarify our understanding of vertebrate reproduction. J. Morphol.

Title = {Coping with potential bi-parental inbreeding: limited pollen and seed
   dispersal and large genets in the dioecious marine angiosperm
   Thalassia testudinum},

Abstract = {The high prevalence of dioecy in marine angiosperms or seagrasses (>50\%
   of all species) is thought to enforce cross-fertilization. However,
   seagrasses are clonal plants, and they may still be subject to
   sibling-mating or bi-parental inbreeding if the genetic neighborhood is
   smaller than the size of the genets. We tested this by determining the
   genetic neighborhoods of the dioecious seagrass Thalassia testudinum at
   two sites (Back-Reef and Mid-Lagoon) in Puerto Morelos Reef Lagoon,
   Mexico, by measuring dispersal of pollen and seeds in situ, and by
   fine-scale spatial autocorrelation analysis with eight polymorphic
   microsatellite DNA markers. Prevalence of inbreeding was verified by
   estimating pairwise kinship coefficients; and by analysing the genotypes
   of seedlings grown from seeds in mesocosms. Average dispersal of pollen
   was 0.3-1.6 m (max. 4.8 m) and of seeds was 0.3-0.4 m (max. 1.8 m),
   resulting in a neighborhood area of 7.4 m(2) (range 3.4-11.4 m(2)) at
   Back-Reef and 1.9 (range 1.87-1.92 m(2)) at Mid-Lagoon. Neighborhood
   area (Na) derived from spatial autocorrelation was 0.1-20.5 m(2) at
   Back-Reef and 0.1-16.9 m(2) at Mid-Lagoon. Maximal extensions of the
   genets, in 19 9 30 m plots, were 19.2 m (median 7.5 m) and 10.8 m
   (median 4.8 m) at Back-Reef and Mid-Lagoon. There was no indication of
   deficit or excess of heterozygotes nor were coefficients of inbreeding
   (FIS) significant. The seedlings did not show statistically significant
   deficit of heterozygotes (except for 1 locus at Back-Reef). Contrary to
   our expectations, we did not find evidence of bi-parental inbreeding in
   this dioecious seagrass with large genets but small genetic
   neighborhoods. Proposed mechanisms to avoid bi-parental inbreeding are
   possible selection against homozygotes during fecundation or ovule
   development. Additionally, the genets grew highly dispersed (aggregation
   index Ac was 0.09 and 0.10 for Back-Reef and Mid-Lagoon, respectively);
   such highly dispersed guerrilla-like clonal growth form likely increases
   the probability of crossing between different potentially unrelated
   genets.},

Abstract = {Numerical modeling of seismic waves in heterogeneous porous reservoir
   rocks is an important tool for the interpretation of seismic surveys in
   reservoir engineering. We apply globally optimal implicit staggered-grid
   finite differences (FD) to model 2-D wave propagation in heterogeneous
   poroelastic media at a low-frequency range (< 10 kHz). We validate the
   numerical solution by comparing it to an analytical-transient solution
   obtaining clear seismic wavefields including fast P and slow P and S
   waves (for a porous media saturated with fluid). The numerical
   dispersion and stability conditions are derived using von Neumann
   analysis, showing that over a wide range of porous materials the Courant
   condition governs the stability and this optimal implicit scheme
   improves the stability of explicit schemes. High-order explicit FD can
   be replaced by some lower order optimal implicit FD so computational
   cost will not be as expensive while maintaining the accuracy. Here, we
   compute weights for the optimal implicit FD scheme to attain an accuracy
   of gamma = 10(-8). The implicit spatial differentiation involves solving
   tridiagonal linear systems of equations through Thomas' algorithm.},

Abstract = {We study the geometry of null hypersurfaces M in generalized Robertson
   Walker spacetimes. First we characterize such null hypersurfaces as
   graphs of generalized eikonal functions over the fiber and use this
   characterization to show that such hypersurfaces are parallel if and
   only if their fibers are also parallel. We further use this technique to
   construct several examples of null hypersurfaces in both de Sitter and
   anti de Sitter spaces. Then we characterize all the totally umbilical
   null hypersurfaces M in a Lorentzian space form (viewed as a quadric in
   a semi-Euclidean ambient space) as intersections of the space form with
   a hyperplane. Finally we study the totally umbilical spacelike
   hypersurfaces of null hypersurfaces in space forms and characterize them
   as planar sections of M. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Geometric and traditional morphometric approaches are tested to describe
   and reveal taxonomic characters and character states in variation of
   shape and size of idiosoma morphology in the Arrenuridae. Patterns of
   variation of idiosoma and glandularia features of males from 11 Mexican
   species of Arrenurus (Megaluracarus) and two species of subgenus
   Dadayella were explored with five landmark configurations and three sets
   of interlandmark distances. Separate principal component analyses (PCA)
   and canonical variate analyses (CVA) were performed for each data set.
   The eight multivariate analyses of variance among 13 a priori groups
   (species) detected significantly different morphometric variants, which
   were interpreted as different taxonomic character states. Patterns of
   character state similarity among species were examined with
   unweighted-pair grouping method using averages (UPGMA) cluster analyses
   on Mahalanobis distances. Analyses of five landmark configurations
   revealed important taxonomical variation in the anterior idiosoma
   outline (10 character states), the outline of the posterior region or
   cauda (13 states), the distribution of postocularia, and the second and
   third pairs of dorsoglandularia (nine states), the fourth pair of
   dorsoglandularia (three states), and ventroglandularia on the posterior
   side of idiosoma (nine character states). Multivariate analyses of three
   sets of distance measurements also resulted in the detection of
   potential taxonomic characters related to idiosoma size (12 character
   states), postocularia and dorsoglandularia (13 states), and
   ventroglandularia (nine character states). Morphometric analyses of
   distances and shapes provide a formal basis for the interpretation of
   taxonomic characters, and for the discovery of character states. These
   characters should be investigated further in a wider sample of species
   for the phylogenetic systematics of these water mites. In the meantime,
   idiosoma regions and structures were tested for congruence in a
   phylogenetic analysis, and were proposed as homologous among the species
   sampled. (C) 2016 The Linnean Society of London},

Title = {Unsteady mixed convection heat transfer from two confined isothermal
   circular cylinders in tandem: Buoyancy and tube spacing effects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {12-30},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this work, two-dimensional numerical simulations are carried out to
   investigate the unsteady mixed convection heat transfer in a laminar
   cross-flow from two equal-sized isothermal in-line cylinders confined
   inside a vertical channel. The governing equations are solved using the
   vorticity-stream function formulation of the incompressible
   Navier-Stokes and energy equations using the control-volume method on a
   non-uniform orthogonal Cartesian grid. The numerical scheme is validated
   for the standard case of a symmetrically confined isothermal circular
   cylinder in a plane channel. Calculations are performed for flow
   conditions with Reynolds number of Re-D = 200, a fixed value of the
   Prandtl number of Pr = 0.744, values of the buoyancy parameter
   (Richardson number) in the range -1 <= Ri <= 4, and a blockage ratio of
   BR = D/H = 0.3. All possible flow regimes are considered by setting the
   pitch-to-diameter ratios (sigma = L/D) to 2, 3 and 5. The interference
   effects and complex flow features are presented in the form of mean and
   instantaneous velocity, vorticity and temperature distributions. In
   addition, separation angles, time traces of velocity fluctuation,
   Strouhal number, characteristic times of flow oscillation, phase-space
   relation between the longitudinal and transverse velocity signals, wake
   structure, and recirculation length behind each cylinder have been
   determined. Local and space-averaged Nusselt numbers for the upstream
   and downstream cylinders have also been obtained. The results reported
   herein demonstrate how the flow and heat transfer characteristics are
   significantly modified by the wall confinement, tube spacing, and
   thermal effects for a wide range in the parametric space. (C) 2016

Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {538-552},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal
   disease of unknown aetiology. A growing body of evidence supports that
   IPF represents an epithelial-driven process characterised by aberrant
   epithelial cell behaviour, fibroblast/myofibroblast activation and
   excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix with the subsequent
   destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms involved in the
   abnormal hyper-activation of the epithelium are unclear, but we propose
   that recapitulation of pathways and processes critical to embryological
   development associated with a tissue specific age-related stochastic
   epigenetic drift may be implicated. These pathways may also contribute
   to the distinctive behaviour of IPF fibroblasts. Genomic and epigenomic
   studies have revealed that wingless/Int, sonic hedgehog and other
   developmental signalling pathways are reactivated and deregulated in
   IPF. Moreover, some of these pathways cross-talk with transforming
   growth factor-beta activating a profibrotic feedback loop. The
   expression pattern of microRNAs is also dysregulated in IPF and exhibits
   a similar expression profile to embryonic lungs. In addition,
   senescence, a process usually associated with ageing, which occurs early
   in alveolar epithelial cells of IPF lungs, likely represents a conserved
   programmed developmental mechanism. Here, we review the major
   developmental pathways that get twisted in IPF, and discuss the
   connection with ageing and potential therapeutic approaches.},

Abstract = {One of the major problems involved controlled cultivation if Patagonia
   pus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus) is its long embryonic period ranging
   between 150-176 days, after which the hatching of planktonic paralarvae
   is achieved. The effect of temperature on the incubation of E.
   megalocyathus eggs was studied with the aim of establishing if a
   temperature higher than 12 degrees C is effective to accelerate the
   embryonic development, without altering their morphological and
   physiological conditions. Fertilized eggs obtained under controlled
   conditions at 11 degrees C +/- 0.1 were randomly distributed in 12 water
   baths of 30 I. at 4 temperatures: 12, 14, 15 and 16 degrees C +/- 0.1
   degrees C. The experiment lasted until egg hatching occurred. The embryo
   growth rate was accelerated at 15-16 degrees C, so the time spent in
   embryonic development can he reduced in 15\% when compared with embryo
   development obtained from eggs incubated at 12 degrees C. The embryos
   showed no significant differences in the final survival and were
   morphometrically similar in all stages of development at all
   temperatures. The increase in temperature from 12 to 16 degrees C, even
   if it allowed a better growth, had high metabolic costs for embryos of
   E. megalocyathus. The activities of lipases and proteases were affected
   by interaction between temperature and the embryo stage, with high
   lipase activity observed in embryos of stage XV incubated at high
   temperatures and the highest levels of trypsin and chymotrypsin in stage
   XX at 14 degrees C. The results suggest that 15 degrees C could he the
   limit temperature to increase growth.},

Title = {Attentional Mechanisms during the Performance of a Subsecond Timing Task},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {There is evidence that timing processes in the suprasecond scale are
   modulated by attentional mechanisms; in addition, some studies have
   shown that attentional mechanisms also affect timing in the subsecond
   scale. Our aim was to study eye movements and pupil diameter during a
   temporal bisection task in the subsecond range. Subjects were trained to
   discriminate anchor intervals of 200 or 800 msec, and were then
   confronted with intermediate durations. Eye movements revealed that
   subjects used different cognitive strategies during the bisection timing
   task. When the stimulus to be timed appeared randomly at a central or 4
   peripheral positions on a screen, some subjects choose to maintain their
   gaze toward the central area while other followed the peripheral
   placement of the stimulus; some others subjects used both strategies.
   The time of subjective equality did not differ between subjects who
   employed different attentional mechanisms. However, differences emerged
   in the timing variance and attentional indexes (time taken to initial
   fixation, latency to respond, pupil dilatation and duration and number
   of fixations to stimulus areas). Timing in the subsecond range seems
   invariant despite the use of different attentional strategies. Future
   research should determine whether the selection of attentional
   mechanisms is related to particular timing tasks or instructions or
   whether it represents idiosyncratic cognitive ``styles{''}.},

Abstract = {Let G be a compact group acting on a Polish group X by means of
   automorphisms. It is proved that the orbit space X/G is an l(2)-manifold
   (resp., homeomorphic to l(2)) provided X is a G-ANR (resp., G-AR) and
   the fixed point set X-G is not locally compact. It is also proved that
   if a compact group G acts affinely on a separable closed convex subset K
   of a Frechet space with a non-locally compact fixed point set K-G, then
   the orbit space KIG is homeomorphic to l(2). In particular, (1) if C(Y,
   X) denotes the space of all maps from a compact metric G-space Y to a
   non-locally compact Polish ANR (resp., AR) group X, endowed with the
   compact open topology and the induced action of G, then the orbit space
   C(Y, X)/G is an l(2)-manifold (resp., homeomorphic to l(2)), and (2) if
   X is an infinite-dimensional separable Frechet G-space and cc(X) denotes
   the hyperspace of all non-empty compact convex subsets of X, endowed
   with the Hausdorff metric topology and the induced action of G, then the
   orbit space cc(X)/G is homeomorphic to l(2), whenever the fixed point
   set cc(X)(G) is not locally compact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Measurements were made for ionization and dissociative ionization cross
   sections of O-2 and N-2 in collisions with 2-10 keV protons. Cross
   sections were measured for both target gases employing the time of
   flight mass spectroscopy for the slow target molecular ions and ionic
   fragments. Measured cross sections were found to connect very well with
   previously measured data. Ionization was found to be dominant and 5
   times higher than dissociative ionization in the case of O-2 and 10
   times in the case ofN(2). Pronounced structure around 5 keV was
   attributed to the transition between the initial and final states of the
   system as well as from quantum or classical effect involving the
   attractive and repulsive parts of the potential energy curves of N-2 and
   O-2. The present data add to the present available data and confirm
   previously measured total cross sections. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Open access, open data, open source and other open scholarship practices
   are growing in popularity and necessity. However, widespread adoption of
   these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that
   researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their
   careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is
   associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential
   collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These
   findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant
   benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.},

Abstract = {Vertebrate taxa with entirely unisexual populations are composed of
   females that reproduce without fertilization and are generally of hybrid
   origin. At least 23 vertebrate families have unisexual lineages. Within
   squamate reptiles, >40 uniparental species have been described from five
   major lineages: acrodont iguanians, Gekkota, Serpentes, Scincomorpha,
   and Varanidae. Pleurodont iguanians include >1100 species, all of which
   have gonochoristic reproduction. Here we report the discovery of a new
   unisexual lizard from the liolaemid genus Liolaemus, a speciesrich
   (similar to 260 species) clade distributed over most of southern South
   American. The new species, Liolaemus parthenos, is the only known
   all-female triploid pleurodont iguanian. The structural chromosome
   heteromorphisms of the karyotypes support the hypothesis that L.
   parthenos is the product of a hybrid origin. Based on morphology, the
   new species is assignable to the L. boulengeri group (sensu Abdala,
   2007), and phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA indicate that L.
   parthenos is nested within L. darwinii, suggesting that the latter is
   the maternal ancestor of this species. Additional data are needed to
   identify the patrilineal ancestor.},

Abstract = {Some force densities can be expressed as a divergence of a stress
   tensor, as is the case with the electromagnetic force density. We have
   shown elsewhere that from the Maxwell equations several balance
   equations of electromagnetic momentum can be derived, depending on the
   form these equations are expressed in terms of fields E, D, B, H, and
   polarisations P and M. These balance equations imply different force
   densities and different stress tensors, providing a great flexibility to
   solve particular problems. Among these force densities we have found
   some proposed in the past with plausibility arguments, like the
   Einstein-Laub force density, while other proposed force densities appear
   as particular or limit cases of these general force densities, like the
   Helmholtz force density. We calculate the radiation force of an
   electromagnetic wave incident on a semi-infinite negligibly absorbing
   material using these balance equations, corroborating in this way that
   the surface integration of the stress tensor gives the same result that
   the calculation made through a volume integration of the force density,
   as done by Bohren. As is usual in applications of Gauss's theorem, the
   surface on which the surface integral is to be performed must be chosen
   judiciously, and due care of discontinuities on the boundary conditions
   must be taken. Advanced undergraduates and graduate students will find a
   different approach to new aspects of the interaction of radiation with
   matter.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article explores the theory of everyday practices in the work of
   jesuit anthropologist Michel de Certeau. In parallel, it considers the
   sources upon which it is built: Kant, Marx, Freud, Wittgenstein and
   Lefebvre, without overlooking the contributions of Foucault and Bourdieu
   with whom he establishes a fructiferous dialogue. As an anthropological
   and political urgency, de Certeau posits the reflection on the human
   practices of habitability and coexistence. A transcendental element of
   belonging would be located within the practices; traditional making do
   through which ``the collective{''} -embodying a primeval value of the
   human species-would remain irreducible to the homogenizing attack of
   modern society. Everyday practices would remain spread as
   ``memories{''}, combining traces of a lost social body: isolated from
   the set they used to be part of, hinting a different cultural model;
   they represent what a group stands for in its present relationship with
   a ``dispersed patrimony{''}. De Certeau's affirmation of freedom of
   practices endorses a magnanimous confidence in the subject's
   intelligence and in the potentiality of the creative human ethos. A
   ``politization of belonging{''} is desirable within his works, where the
   accepted tradition would be transformed in a ``history to do{''}.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We present a numerical calculation for the stationary magnetic field
   produced by different rotating bodies with homogeneous and constant
   surface charge density. The calculation is done by superposing the
   magnetic field produced by a set of loops of current which mimic the
   magnetic field produced by belts of current defined by slices of fixed
   width. We consider the cases of a sphere, ellipsoids, open and closed
   cylinders and a combination of these in a dumb-bell-like shell. We also
   plot their magnetic field lines using a technique that make use of the
   Runge-Kutta fourth-order method. Up to our knowledge, the case of closed
   cylinders was not calculated before. In contrast to previous results, we
   find that the magnetic field inside finite hollow bodies is homogeneous
   only in the case of a sphere. This is consequence of the fact that, for
   the sphere, the surface of any slice taken perpendicularly to the
   rotation axis, depends only on its thickness, like in the case of an
   infinite cylinder.},

Abstract = {It is generally accepted that polyploids have downsized basic genomes
   rather than additive values with respect to their related diploids.
   Changes in genome size have been reported in correlation with several
   biological characteristics. About 75 \% of around 350 species recognized
   for Paspalum (Poaceae) are polyploid and most polyploids are apomictic.
   Multiploid species are common with most of them bearing sexual diploid
   and apomictic tetraploid or other ploidy levels. DNA content in the
   embryo and the endosperm was measured by flow cytometry in a
   seed-by-seed analysis of 47 species including 77 different entities. The
   relative DNA content of the embryo informed the genome size of the
   accession while the embryo:endosperm ratio of DNA content revealed its
   reproductive mode. The genome sizes (2C-value) varied from 0.5 to 6.5 pg
   and for 29 species were measured for the first time. Flow cytometry
   provided new information on the reproductive mode for 12 species and one
   botanical variety and supplied new data for 10 species concerning
   cytotypes reported for the first time. There was no significant
   difference between the mean basic genome sizes (1Cx-values) of 32 sexual
   and 45 apomictic entities. Seventeen entities were diploid and 60 were
   polyploids with different degrees. There were no clear patterns of
   changes in 1Cx-values due to polyploidy or reproductive systems, and the
   existing variations are in concordance with subgeneric taxonomical
   grouping.},

Abstract = {Western house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) and common shrews (Sorex
   araneus) are important models for study of chromosomal speciation. Both
   had ancestral karyotypes consisting of telocentric chromosomes, and each
   is subdivided into numerous chromosomal races many of which have
   resulted from fixation of new mutations (Robertsonian fusions and
   whole-arm reciprocal translocations). However, some chromosomal races in
   both species may alternatively have originated through hybridization,
   with particular homozygous recombinant products reaching fixation. Here,
   we demonstrate the process of generation of hybrid chromosomal races for
   the first time in either species using molecular markers. Analysis of
   centromeric microsatellite markers show that the Mid Valtellina (IMVA)
   and Upper Valtellina (IUVA) chromosomal races of the house mouse are
   recombinant products of hybridization of the Lower Valtellina (ILVA) and
   Poschiavo (CHPO) chromosomal races, supporting earlier theoretical
   analysis. IMVA and IUVA occupy a small area of the Italian Alps where
   ILVA makes contact with CHPO. IUVA and CHPO have previously been shown
   to be reproductively isolated in one village, emphasizing that hybrid
   chromosomal races in small mammals, as in plants, have the potential to
   be part of the speciation process.},

Title = {Demography of Oenocarpus bataua and implications for sustainable
   harvest of its fruit in western Amazon},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {463-476},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Oenocarpus bataua is the seventh most abundant tree in the Amazon and
   one of the most used palms in the region. The main resource obtained
   from the species is the fruits that are harvested from wild populations
   for human consumption. Across its distribution area adults are most
   frequently felled to obtain the racemes, which may affect the palm's
   populations. In this paper we studied the demography of two populations
   of Oenocarpus bataua to assess the harvest potential of its fruits and
   the density variation in different habitats in the western Amazon to
   estimate fruit yields in different forest types. Non-inundated lands
   held the greatest densities with an average of 11 adults ha(-1) (0-132
   adults ha(-1)). The population finite growth rate (lambda) in Amacayacu,
   Colombia, was 0.9103 because of slow growth and low survival of stemless
   individuals and low recruitment. On the contrary, in Yasuni, Ecuador, we
   found a growing population with lambda = 1.0368. According to our
   simulations, adult felling reduced transient population growth (lambda
   (t) ) in both populations, especially when harvest was frequent even at
   low intensities. In Amacayacu a simulated harvest of 60 \% year(-1) of
   the fruits by climbing did not modify lambda (t) substantially, while in
   Yasuni, a regime of 80 \% of annual harvest did not diminish lambda (t)
   below one and the initial number of adults. The results help to
   understand the demography of useful palms and to address sustainable
   management. For instance high yields can be obtained by shifting to
   non-destructive harvest techniques that can meet the increasing demand
   and maintain the populations.},

Title = {Status epilepticus triggers early mitochondrial fusion in the rat
   hippocampus in a lithium-pilocarpine model},
Journal = {EPILEPSY RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {11-19},

Abstract = {Many reports investigating the hippocampus have demonstrated an increase
   in neuronal damage, cellular loss, oxidative stress and mitochondria!
   DNA damage during status epilepticus (SE); however, information
   regarding alterations in mitochondrial fission and fusion events in SE
   is lacking. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible
   imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion in the hippocampus of
   male rats after acute seizure mediated by SE. In this study, we used
   ninety animals were randomly divided into control and SE groups and
   subjected to the lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Hippocampi were
   obtained at 3, 24 and 72 h after SE, and the cytoplasmic and
   mitochondrial fractions of the cells were used to analyze changes in the
   Drp1 and Fis1 fission proteins and the Mfn1 and Opal fusion proteins by
   western blot analysis. Moreover, changes in the expression of fission
   and fusion mRNA transcripts were evaluated by real-time PCR.
   Mitochondrial morphology was also analyzed using standard transmission
   electron microscopy. Our data showed that the fission-related mRNA Drp1
   was down-regulated rapidly after SE, while Fis1 did not show any
   significant changes in expression. Moreover, the mitochondrial
   fusion-associated proteins Mfn1 and Opa1 exhibited an increase in
   expression at 72 h after SE. Electron microphotography revealed several
   morphological changes, such as swollen mitochondria and damage of the
   inner mitochondrial membrane, at 24 h; at 72 h elongation of some
   mitochondrial was also observed. Our results suggest that after the
   initiation of SE, the main regulator of the fission mRNA Drp1 is
   down-regulated, which in turn regulates mitochondrial fission and leads
   to an increase in the Mfn1 and Opa1 proteins to induce mitochondrial
   fusion, suggesting an imbalance of the fission and fusion processes. (C)

   worldwide that live mainly as ectosymbionts of crustaceans.
   Lagenophryids are characterized by possession of a lorica, but the
   lorica aperture and the associated parts of the body differ between
   genera. Despite their widespread distribution, relatively few papers
   have been published on lagenophryids in recent years, and the present
   paper is intended to promote research on lagenophryids by providing an
   annotated checklist of all known species and a brief review of the
   family, including data of their geographic distribution and their hosts.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, an ever-increasing cluster of phenomena has attracted
   the attention of social scientists and historians of medicine: processes
   of medicalization. As in other regions, Latin America has been affected
   by these phenomena. This article surveys recent literature involving
   sociological studies of these processes in the region, in order to
   provide an overview of the issue. It explores the theoretical
   transformations linked to the concept of medicalization in the contexts
   where they originated. It then analyzes the ways in which the concept
   has been appropriated by the social sciences in Latin America in order
   to describe the various phenomena associated with medicalization in the
   subcontinent.},

Title = {Seasonal variability of saltwater intrusion at a point-source submarine

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge provides freshwater and nutrients to
   coastal environments. In some places throughout the world, this direct
   connection between aquifers and oceans may also allow saltwater
   intrusion. Saltwater intrusion was studied at a submarine spring within
   a fringing reef lagoon on the eastern Yucatan Peninsula by observing its
   intratidal and synoptic-scale variations during wet and dry periods.
   Saltwater intrusion was linked to wave-driven setup, no rain, high
   tides, and sea-level rise caused by remote forcing from Yucatan Current
   variability. Jet discharge velocities were inversely related to tidal
   oscillations, with maximum velocities at low tides. The wet period
   produced saltwater intrusion at high tides associated with three
   different conditions: syzygy tides, wave setup, and Yucatan Current
   weakening. During the dry period, saltwater intrusion occurred
   throughout most high tides and was aided by Yucatan Current weakening
   and wind-driven setup within the lagoon. These results suggested that
   seasonal precipitation was most important in modulating spring
   discharge, followed by syzygy tides, Yucatan Current variability, and
   wave events. The spring discharge was modeled with a modified Bernoulli
   energy equation that included a friction term. Aquifer elevation and a
   friction factor were used as free parameters. The dry period produced
   the best model results because of infrequent rainfall that yielded a
   relatively steady aquifer level. Precipitation during the wet period
   most likely led to a more variable aquifer level, reducing the variance
   explained by the model that assumes a constant aquifer elevation.
   Nevertheless, the model predicted saltwater intrusion events reasonably
   well using simplified physics.},

Abstract = {Negative oxygen ions (O-2(-) + O-) in the bulk of a dc discharge for
   Ar/O-2 gas mixture have been determined employing Langmuir
   probe-assisted laser photodetachment. Electron density and temperature
   were obtained for the mixture at discharge powers between 2 and 15 W and
   pressure between 75 and 375 mtorr. Electron temperature shows very
   minimum dependence on pressure, while electron number density is
   increasing with power and decreasing as a function of pressure. Total
   negative ion number density showed an increasing trend as a function of
   power, while decreasing as the pressure was increased at a constant
   discharge power. Equally negative ion density was found to decrease as
   the O-2 percentage in the mixture was increased under the same
   conditions of discharge pressure and power. The maximum negative ion
   number density was found to be about 6.5 E14 at 75 mtorr and 5.5 W of
   power with 25\% O-2 in the mixture. The electronegativity at 150 mtorr
   pressure and 5 W of discharge power was found to decrease from 0.21 to a
   minimum of 0.06 and increase again to 0.11 as the O2 partial pressure
   was varied from 25\% to 100\% with the minimum at 75\% O-2.},

Title = {Finding potential high-yield areas for Mexican maize under current and

Abstract = {Analyses of the geographic patterns of wild species abundance have been
   carried out in studies ranging from those interested in hot-spots for
   biodiversity and conservation to basic ecological analyses. Based on the
   methodological approaches used, the present study searched for areas of
   higher yield among native races of maize in Mexico, its centre of origin
   and diversification. Ecological theory suggests that population fitness,
   and thus abundance, is maximal at the centroid of the multi-dimensional
   ecological niche of a particular species, and decreases progressively as
   distance from it increases. In the present study, yield was used instead
   of abundance, assuming it to be higher under optimal environmental
   conditions. It was assessed whether nine Mexican maize races exhibited
   higher yields in areas that are ecologically closer to their niche
   centroid (NC), or a niche optimum (NO) that did not always coincide with
   the geometric centroid. Environmental and geographical clusters for each
   race were also created to identify additional NOs in widely distributed
   races. All races showed significant correlations between yield and
   distance, both to the NC or NOs, but in only six of them was the chosen
   model better than the null model. Three races and two sub-groups were
   selected for projection under climate change conditions: Celaya (R-2 =
   0288), Celaya 3 (R-2 = 0774), Vandeno (R-2 = 0277) and Vandeno 2 (R-2 =
   0466) and Tepecintle (R-2 = 0537). The Celaya race improved with
   environmental clustering, while Vandeno improved under geographical
   clustering. Finally, Tepecintle was projected at a race level.
   Projections under climate change suggested some potential areas for high
   yields in the future. It was concluded that the approach used in the
   present paper, considering the distance to NC/NO as a predictor of maize
   landrace yield, may contribute important information to agro-ecological
   projects.},

Title = {Creosote Bush (Larrea tridentata)le Improves Insulin Sensitivity
   and Reduces Plasma and Hepatic Lipids in Hamsters Fed a High Fat and
   Cholesterol Diet},

Abstract = {Creosote bush, Larrea tridentata (Sesse y Moc. Ex DC, Zygophyllaceae) is
   a shrub found in the deserts of Northern Mexico and Southwestern United
   States. In traditional medicine, it is used to treat a variety of
   illnesses including type 2 diabetes. The present study aims to
   investigate the effects of creosote bush ethanolic extract on plasma and
   liver parameters associated with the metabolic syndrome in hamsters fed
   a high fat and cholesterol diet (HFD), comparing them with those induced
   by ezetimibe (EZ). Seven groups of six hamsters each were formed. Six
   groups were fed HFD for 2 weeks. The following 2 weeks, the HFD groups
   received: (1) only HFD, (2) HFD + 3 mg\% EZ, (3) HFD + 0.2\% creosote
   bush ethanolic extract, (4) only standard diet (Std Diet), (5) Std Diet
   + 3 mg\% EZ, (6) Std Diet + 0.2\% creosote bush ethanolic extract. The
   beneficial effects of creosote bush ethanolic extract in the HFD hamster
   model were a reduction of insulin resistance, associated with lower
   serum insulin and leptin, lower hepatic lipid peroxidation and higher
   liver antioxidant capacity. Plasma and liver lipids tended or were
   reduced to values closer to those of animals fed standard diet. A
   similar effect on lipids was induced by EZ, although with even lower
   hepatic cholesterol and total lipids concentrations. In general, the
   change from HFD to standard diet plus ethanolic extract induced the same
   but deeper changes, including a reduction in plasma glucose and an
   increase in the percentage of HDL cholesterol. Unlike creosote bush
   extract, EZ increased food consumption and neutral fecal steroids, with
   no significant effect on body weight, epididymal fat pads, liver
   peroxidation or antioxidant capacity. Also EZ did not modify serum
   insulin and leptin. However, insulin sensitivity improved to values
   similar to those induced by the extract. This suggests that the
   mechanism of action of creosote bush ethanolic extract is different to
   inhibition of cholesterol absorption or increase excretion. The
   ethanolic extract of L. tridentata could be useful in the treatment of
   the metabolic syndrome.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Lovelock theory provides a tractable model of higher-curvature gravity
   in which several questions can be studied analytically. This is the
   reason why, in the last years, this theory has become the favorite arena
   to study the effects of higher-curvature terms in the context of AdS/CFT
   correspondence. Lovelock theory also admits extensions that permit to
   accommodate matter coupled to gravity in a non-minimal way. In this
   setup, problems such as the backreaction of matter on the black hole
   geometry can also be solved exactly. In this paper, we study the
   thermodynamics of black holes in theories of gravity of this type, which
   include both higher-curvature terms, U(1) gauge fields, and conformal
   couplings with matter fields in D dimensions. These charged black hole
   solutions exhibit a backreacting scalar field configuration that is
   regular everywhere outside and on the horizon, and may exist both in
   asymptotically flat and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We
   work out explicitly the boundary action for this theory, which renders
   the variational problem well-posed and suffices to regularize the
   Euclidean action in AdS. We also discuss several interrelated properties
   of the theory, such as its duality symmetry under field redefinition and
   how it acts on black holes and gravitational wave solutions.},

Abstract = {We analysed distributional data of 30 species of Oribatid mites of the
   Subantarctic subregion of southern South America in order to contribute
   to elucidate their biotic evolution. We constructed individual tracks
   for the species analysed, based on published and unpublished records.
   After superposing them we obtained six generalized tracks and five
   nodes. Four generalized tracks (T2, T3, T4 and T6) extend along and near
   the Andean ranges, whereas two generalized tracks (T1 and T5) may be
   artefacts caused by the lack of information. The generalized tracks and
   nodes show the complex relationships of the austral biota, as
   hypothesized in previous contributions based on other plant and animal
   taxa.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana has been an excellent model system for molecular
   genetic approaches to development and physiology. More recently, the
   potential of studying various accessions collected from diverse habitats
   has been started to exploit. Col 0 has been the best-studied accession
   but we now know that several traits show significant divergences among
   them. In this work, we focused in the root that has become a key system
   for development. We studied root architecture and growth dynamics of 12
   Arabidopsis accessions. Our data reveal a wide variability in root
   architecture and root length among accessions. We also found variability
   in the root apical meristem (RAM), explained mainly by cell size at the
   RAM transition domain and possibly by peculiar forms of organization at
   the stem cell niche in some accessions. Contrary to Col-O reports, in
   some accessions the RAM size not always explains the variations in the
   root length; indicating that elongated cell size could be more relevant
   in the determination of root length than the RAM size itself. This study
   contributes to investigations dealing with understanding the molecular
   and cellular basis of phenotypic variation, the role of plasticity on
   adaptation, and the developmental mechanisms that may restrict
   phenotypic variation in response to contrasting environmental
   conditions.},

   streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced diabetic rats were
   assessed. An oral administration of the water extract at doses of 40 and
   160 mg/kg and of the methanol extract at doses of 67 and 268 mg/kg were
   evaluated. Furthermore, the water extract at 160 mg/kg was evaluated
   under an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.
   Results: The tested extracts were able to reduce the increase in blood
   glucose level at three hours after administration. L-chiro-inositol and
   chlorogenic acid were isolated as important constituents of the plant,
   they were identified in both extracts along with other constituents.
   Conclusions: The results presented here demonstrate that the main
   components in the aqueous extract of Ageratina petiolaris are
   chlorogenic acid and L-chiro-inositol, the last one with significant
   hypoglycemic activity, these results support the traditional use of this
   plant for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

Title = {Effects of buoyancy and inclination for opposing mixed convection in a
   symmetrical heated duct with a plane symmetric sudden
   contraction-expansion},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {324-338},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this work, transient laminar opposing mixed convection is studied
   experimentally in an open vertical rectangular channel configuration
   with plane symmetric forward-backward facing steps located at the middle
   of the test section with uniform heat flux imposed to the lateral walls
   of each step while the other bounding walls are treated as adiabatic
   surfaces. The effect of opposing buoyancy and the geometrical
   configuration of partial blockage on the heat transfer behavior for the
   double stepped wall is analyzed for a Reynolds number of 300 <= Re <=
   900, channel inclination of 0 degrees <= gamma <= 90, and different
   values of buoyancy strength or modified Richardson number. From
   experimental measurements, space-averaged surface temperatures and
   overall Nusselt number of each simulated electrbnic chip are obtained
   for a wide range in the parametric space. Also, phase-space plots of the
   self-oscillatory system, characteristic times of temperature
   oscillations and spectral distribution of the fluctuating energy are
   presented. Results show that for relatively large values of buoyancy
   strength, strong three-dimensional secondary flow oscillations develop
   in the axial and spanwise directions. The temperature measurements show
   that for a fixed value of the modified Richardson number, there is not a
   linear dependence between the duct orientation and the heat transfer
   rates achieved. Also, when the duct is inclined with respect to the
   horizontal, the right (upper) and left (lower) oscillating vortical
   structures present large and small amplitude thermal fluctuations,
   respectively. In addition, it is pointed out that the highest flow
   reversal takes place at the channel corners of the upper heater block,
   and that higher surface temperatures are reached at the centerline of
   the latter. The analysis brings out the significance of the
   three-dimensional configuration of the vortical structure and how the
   buoyancy induced secondary flow is affected by the partial blockage. (C)

Title = {Theremophile mats of microalgae growing on the woody structure of a

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {The aims of this research are to identify and describe a periphyton
   community of thermophilic microalgae in order to expand our knowledge on
   biodiversity of a particular environment. Conspicuous biomass of
   thermophilic microalgae (48 degrees C) inhabits the cooling towers of
   the thermoelectric power plant of Villa de Reyes (Central Mexico).
   Aggregate samples or micro algal mats were taken in three different
   areas of the top of a cooling tower, for identification. According to
   the sequencing analysis of 16S and 18S rDNA genes, the community is
   dominated by 3 species of Cyanoprokaryota: Chlorogloeopsis fritschii,
   Arthronema africanum and Chroococcidiopsis sp., previously reported as
   thermophiles. Also, 2 species of the Chlorophyte or green algae
   Scenedesmus. Finally, 12 species of diatoms comprise the microalgal
   community; diatoms were only microscopically identified within the mats,
   suggesting that the mats constitute a suitable microenvironment in
   thermal ambiences. The identified species are of particular interest
   because their habitat represents an extreme and an artificial biotope.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of thermophilic
   communities of microalgae in Mexico from a power plant; also, this is
   the first report of A. africanum for the country. All Rights Reserved

Title = {Mistletoe infection in an urban forest in Mexico City},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {126-134},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Urban forests are important lungs for urbanized environments; therefore,
   their study and conservation are needed. Compared with trees in natural
   areas, urban trees develop in more stressful conditions, which may make
   them more susceptible to infections by parasites such as mistletoes.
   Bosque de Tlalpan (BT) is an urban forest embedded in one of the largest
   cities of the world, Mexico City. The aim of this study was to assess
   which mistletoe species were present in BT, determine the intensity of
   the infestation, and distinguish which host species are more susceptible
   to mistletoe parasitism based on 20 randomly selected plots. We found
   that Cladocolea loniceroides was extensively distributed on the
   cultivated area of BT (17 plots), whereas a second species, Phoradendron
   brachystachyum, was found only on four plots. Seven tree species were
   susceptible to infection by C. loniceroides, whereas only one was
   susceptible to infection by P. brachystachyum. Fraxinus uhdei, the most
   abundant host, was the one with higher severities and larger sizes (tree
   height and crown length); the latter variables positively influence the
   severity of infection. Reforestation of the cultivated area with low
   diversity and exotic species appears to be a reason for the increased
   infestation. Therefore, we support the reforestation of urban areas with
   native species to provide benefits such as a lower incidence of
   parasitic infection and tree mortality. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All

   temperate forests with different levels of disturbance, and to correlate
   their abundance and diversity of species, with that found in other
   arthropod communities of the same forests. The work was carried out in
   three municipalities in the North of the State of Mexico, where three
   types of different forests were identified by their degree of
   disturbance. These types include: 1) primary forest (PF), with typical
   species of a conserved forest; 2) mixed forest (MF), with species of a
   conserved forest and a reforestation effort; and 3) reforested forest
   (RF), with species used in reforestation efforts and indicative of
   disturbance. In each sample, an area of 2 500 m(2) was selected. Each
   area had 16 pitfalls apiece and they were placed 10 m away from each
   other. Samples were collected twice; one from February through March
   2009 (dry season) and another from August through September 2010 (rainy
   season), which produced a total of 192 traps. Obtained specimens were
   identified at the most taxonomically specific level. All data captured
   was transformed to root n + 0.5 and diversity index levels of Shannon
   and Simpson were calculated, as well as richness of species for ants,
   beetles, grasshoppers, true bugs, and spiders. The values of richness,
   diversity, and abundance were correlated with the Pearson coefficient,
   and to evaluate possible causal relationships between these, a path
   analysis was performed. Results suggested an important influence of the
   site over ant communities, and values of richness, abundance and
   diversity were correlated with the communities of spiders, beetles,
   grasshoppers and true bugs, but not for all the sites studied. Responses
   to environmental changes are not only on the numeric proportions of
   abundance, richness and diversity, but also in the indirect and casual
   ecological interactions. Finally, the data seems to indicate that the
   responses of the ants to the environmental changes are not necessarily
   reflected on other organisms' communities, so the ants' role as
   bioindicators can be limited.},

Abstract = {Erichsonella attenuata is an isopod species distributed in the Western
   Atlantic region of the Gulf of Mexico and is associated with sea -grass
   beds composed of Ruppia maritima, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia
   testudinum. In the Gulf of Mexico, this isopod species is found only
   along the USA coasts, in Texas and Florida. The aim of this work is to
   report, for the first time, the presence of E. attenuata along Mexican
   coasts, particularly in the Tamiahua and Terminos lagoons in the states
   of Veracruz and Campeche, respectively. These are the most southern
   records for the Gulf of Mexico, showing that this species expands its
   coverage virtually to the entire coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The

Abstract = {We studied and illustrated the structure of the chorion of four species
   from two genera of the subfamily Coliadinae: Anteos and Rhabdodryas. The
   descriptions of Anteos maerula and A. clorinde were reviewed with new
   materials from Mexico and Colombia. The chorionic relief and the
   micro-grid of A. menippe were inspected for the first time, in addition
   to the Rhabdodryas trite, thought absent. Using a scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), photographs were taken of four chorionic regions
   (micropylar, perimicropylar or apical, equator, and base) in the three
   species of Anteos; these were described, illustrated, and compared. The
   images in SEM allowed analysis and determining that the micro-grid is an
   external section of exochorion (relief): multiple polygonal
   micro-reticular matrix in each unit. Until now their presence in the
   genera studied and Prestonia, Aphrissa, and Phoebis allowed postulation
   of it as a synapomorphy in the group called `American Catopsilias'.
   Clear and distinguishably the micro-grid, as described here, is only
   registered with this clade of Pieridae, Coliadinae. The characters
   specialized in the chorion recorded in A. menippe allowed us to suggest
   that the genus Rhodocera for this species is synonymous of Anteos.},

Abstract = {The description and relatively detailed illustration of the chorion of

   different species from those recently presented of the genera Hamadryas,
   Marpesia, Eunica, Catonephele, Myscelia, Asterope, Epiphile, Callicore,
   and Cyclogramma; they were collected from Mexico and Colombia. The study
   was from a sample of 35 females of which 15 had mature eggs. The major
   structural features of the chorion were characterized: color, shape,
   size, and relief: perimicropilar differentiation and formation of axes
   and ribs. A distinction was made over specialized traits in the apical
   and equatorial zones as well as the degree of thickening of the axes.
   Types of eggs recently recognized are followed with the nomenclature of
   the descriptions. The results confirm architecture specific and features
   to each suprageneric taxon. It supported the proposal to use the chorion
   as a taxonomic character, because each genus and species has unique
   characteristics. Also supported, one more time, was the possibility of
   resurgance of the subtribe Eunicina of Reuter, by separating Eunica and
   other genera of the Epicaliina subtribe. The chorionic similitude of
   Cyclogramma and Diaethria sustain the proposal of Lamas to consider both
   as synonyms.},

Title = {Transient mixed convection heat transfer for opposing flow from two
   discrete flush-mounted heaters in a rectangular channel of finite
   length: Effect of buoyancy and inclination angle},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {357-372},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An experimental investigation in a vertical rectangular channel using
   water as the working fluid is carried out to study the transient laminar
   opposing mixed convection heat transfer from two flush mounted,
   symmetric and discrete heat sources subjected to a constant wall heat
   flux boundary condition while the other bounding walls are insulated and
   adiabatic. The experiments are done under different values of buoyancy
   strength or modified Richardson number Ri{*} = Gr{*}/Re-2, Reynolds
   number of 300 <= Re <= 900 and channel inclination of 0 degrees <= gamma
   <= 90 degrees. From experimental measurements, surface temperature
   distributions and averaged Nusselt number for each heat source are
   obtained. In general, for a fixed value of the buoyancy parameter, the
   averaged Nusselt number increases for increasing values of the Reynolds
   number. In the vertical channel configuration, it is observed that for
   fixed values of Re and high Ri{*} number, because buoyancy acts directly
   against convective flow, higher heat transfer rates are achieved. As the
   duct approaches the horizontal configuration, buoyancy strength is
   reduced and the averaged Nusselt number decreases for decreasing values
   of the inclination angle with marked variations. Here, the effect on the
   heat transfer rates is more pronounced at gamma = 60 degrees for low Re.
   For the horizontal configuration, because buoyancy only acts indirectly,
   higher threshold values of Ri{*} are required to induce instability. The
   results show that for relatively large values of buoyancy strength, the
   surface temperature presents strong spanwise and axial variations, and
   for all of the inclination angles considered in this study, the values
   of the surface temperatures achieve higher values at the middle spanwise
   positions of both heaters than those registered at other spanwise
   locations. This indicates that because of the secondary
   three-dimensional flow, heat transfer augmentation takes place close to
   the channel corners while the higher surface temperatures and hence,
   lower heat transfer rates are achieved at the centerline of the discrete
   heat sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Puma density, habitat use and conflict with humans in the Argentine
   Chaco},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The puma Puma concolor is the most widely distributed felid in the
   Americas. Although it utilizes human modified landscapes, its extensive
   territorial requirements, trophic needs, and real or perceived threats
   to livestock render the puma susceptible to conflict with humans. Our
   objectives were to evaluate the population density, habitat use, and
   puma-human conflict in the Argentine Chaco. We conducted camera-trap
   surveys and interviews over a three-year period, at three sites with
   different levels of legal protection and with different ranch outpost
   and livestock densities: Copo National Park (1204 trap days, 24
   stations, 17 interviews, national park, lowest ranch/livestock density),
   Aborigen Reserve (1993 trap days, 29 stations, 13 interviews, indigenous
   reserve, medium ranch/livestock density) and El Cantor (2129 trap days,
   35 stations, 11 interviews, no protection, highest ranch/livestock
   density). Puma population density was low (<1 individual/100 km(2)) and
   we found no significant differences in puma density across the three
   sites. Occupancy models show a positive relationship between puma
   detectability and the distances from vehicle roads. Legal protection
   status of the area does not positively affect puma density, probably due
   to the large edge effect, and weak law enforcement capacity at Copo
   National Park. Low density of pumas at the three sites could result
   primarily from retaliation killing of pumas by local ranchers in
   response to predation on goats. Pumas in the Chaco require effectively
   managed protected areas, regulation of wildlife hunting and livestock
   management practices to minimize depredation. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {We describe a new species of anguid lizard of the genus Mesaspis from
   the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes of northwestern Guatemala. This species
   reaches a maximum snout-vent length of about 72 mm, making it much
   smaller than Mesaspis moreletii. In the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes it
   occurs sympatrically with Mesaspis moreletii temporalis, the only such
   instance of congeneric sympatry known in Nuclear Central America. The
   new species appears most similar to the widely distributed species M.
   moreletii, whichmay be polytypic. Mesaspis cuchumatanus may be
   distinguished from M. moreletii by usually having expanded supranasals,
   16 longitudinal scale rows, small and granular scales covering the side
   of the neck from about the level of upper edge of auricular opening to
   ventrolateral fold, and smaller body size.},

Title = {Population genetic analysis and bioclimatic modeling in Agave
   striata in the Chihuahuan Desert indicate higher genetic variation
   and lower differentiation in drier and more variable environments},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {103},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1020-1029},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Is there an association between bioclimatic
   variables and genetic variation within species? This question can be
   approached by a detailed analysis of population genetics parameters
   along environmental gradients in recently originated species (so genetic
   drift does not further obscure the patterns). The genus Agave, with more
   than 200 recent species encompassing a diversity of morphologies and
   distributional patterns, is an adequate system for such analyses. We
   studied Agave striata, a widely distributed species from the Chihuahuan
   Desert, with a distinctive iteroparous reproductive ecology and two
   recognized subspecies with clear morphological differences. We used
   population genetic analyses along with bioclimatic studies to understand
   the effect of environment on the genetic variation and differentiation
   of this species.
   METHODS: We analyzed six populations of the subspecies A. striata subsp.
   striata, with a southern distribution, and six populations of A. striata
   subsp. falcata, with a northern distribution, using 48 ISSR loci and a
   total of 541 individuals (averaging 45 individuals per population). We
   assessed correlations between population genetics parameters (the levels
   of genetic variation and differentiation) and the bioclimatic variables
   of each population. We modeled each subspecies distribution and used
   linear correlations and multifactorial analysis of variance.
   KEY RESULTS: Genetic variation (measured as expected heterozygosity)
   increased at higher latitudes. Higher levels of genetic variation in
   populations were associated with a higher variation in environmental
   temperature and lower precipitation. Stronger population differentiation
   was associated with wetter and more variable precipitation in the
   southern distribution of the species. The two subspecies have genetic
   differences, which coincide with their climatic differences and
   potential distributions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Differences in genetic variation among populations and the
   genetic differentiation between A. striata subsp. striata and A. striata
   subsp. falcata is correlated with differences in environmental climatic
   variables along their distribution. We found two distinct gene pools
   that suggest active differentiation and perhaps incipient speciation.
   The detected association between genetic variation and environment
   variables indicates that climatic variables are playing an important
   role in the differentiation of A. striata.},

Abstract = {We report time-dependent calculations of attosecond and femtosecond
   forces imposed by a kilovolt swift electron during passage near a
   nanometer-sized metal particle. Contrary to expectations based on
   dielectric theory, which suggest that the forces should always be
   attractive, we find that for very close approaches, attosecond forces
   are repulsive, and are caused by interaction of the magnetic field of
   the relativistic electron with currents within even nominally
   nonmagnetic nanoparticles. These results suggest an explanation for the
   observation of both attractive and repulsive nanoparticle movement
   during the first use of Angstrom-sized electron beams in electron
   microscopy.},

Volume = {344},

Abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous structure that holds
   the homologous chromosomes in close proximity while they exchange
   genetic material in a process known as meiotic recombination. This
   meiotic recombination leads to genetic variability in sexually
   reproducing organisms. The ultrastructure of the SC is studied by
   electron microscopy and it is observed as a tripartite structure. Two
   lateral elements (LE) separated by a central region (CR) confer its
   classical tripartite organization. The LEs are the anchoring platform
   for the replicated homologous chromosomes to properly exchange genetic
   material with one another. An accurate assembly of the LE is
   indispensable for the proper completion of meiosis. Ultrastructural
   studies suggested that the LE is organized as a multilayered unit.
   However, no validation of this model has been previously provided. In
   this ultrastructural study, by using mice with different genetic
   backgrounds that affect the LE width, we provide further evidence that
   support a multilayered organization of the LE. Additionally, we provide
   data suggesting additional roles of the different cohesin complex
   components in the structure of the LEs of the SC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Local and continental determinants of giant anteater
   (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) abundance: Biome, human and
   jaguar roles in population regulation},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is currently found in a
   wide variety of habitats from Honduras to Argentina. Across this wide
   range, researchers have postulated that anteater populations are
   negatively affected by several factors, including hunting, habitat loss
   and fragmentation, fire, vehicle collisions, and predation by jaguars.
   But no studies to date have evaluated the relative importance of these
   factors across sites, either at a regional or continental scale. We used
   camera traps to analyze variation in giant anteater abundance at two
   spatial scales. At a regional scale, we conducted camera trap surveys in
   the dry Chaco of Argentina and used occupancy models to explore the
   effect of protection status and human accessibility on giant anteaters'
   relative abundance. At a continental scale, we used data from 40 camera
   trap studies (representing 42 different locations) and Generalized
   Linear Models (GLM) to assess the potential relation of biome, human
   disturbance and the presence of jaguars on giant anteater camera trap
   records. In the Argentine Chaco, protection and human disturbance do not
   significantly affect the proportion of area used by the species. The
   average anteater records/100 camera days and the proportion of sites
   used are very high across the study area. At a continental scale,
   anteaters are more frequently recorded in dry forests than in moist
   forests. Locations with very high human disturbance have camera trap
   rates that are 5-10 times lower compared to intermediate or low
   disturbance locations. Finally, giant anteater capture frequency
   increases up to 70\% where jaguars are absent. Dry biomes and
   intermediate levels of human disturbance may favor anteaters by
   providing greater habitat heterogeneity coupled with a lower jaguar
   abundance. This may explain the relatively high abundance of giant
   anteaters in the Argentine Chaco. However, growing human populations,
   the advancing agriculture-livestock frontier, and an expanding road
   network may in time eliminate giant anteaters from most of this region.

Abstract = {The application and development of environmental laws governing
   watershed management requires identification of biological indicators,
   parameters and measures to establish its ecological status, for which
   the present study aims to characterize the ecological indicator value of
   stream benthic algae in an urban area of Mexico City. Six sites of the
   Magdalena river were studied in the most contrasting seasons: dry-warm,
   rainy and dry-cold. At each site the physicochemical parameters of water
   were recorded and 10 samples were collected: Five with visible algal
   growths and five with diatoms. The environmental quality of each site
   was determined by the trophic status and its confirmation with the
   richness and benthic algal diversity, through a canonical correspondence
   analysis and the calculation of the indicator value of species (IndVal).
   According to the trophic status, three groups of sites were recognized.
   The first group (G1) was assessed as reference of the oligotrophic
   conditions and presented 11 species with the highest IndVal, protruding:
   Encyonema silesiacum, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula cryptocephala,
   Planothidium lanceolatum, Vaucheria bursata, Placoma regulare and Nostoc
   parmelioides. A second group (G2) was associated with 15 species
   considered detectors, which were tolerant to increased nutrients in at
   least one season, such as Diatoma mesodon and Prasiola mexicana. The
   third group (G3) included sites with species that had a wide range of
   tolerance to pollution: Fistulifera saprophila, Nitzschia minuta,
   Nitzschia palea, Nitzschia recta and Phormidium autumnale. The species
   IndVal of Magdalena River has established reference sites of good
   environmental quality and those that are altered by human activities,
   therefore they are recommended as the first step in a methodological
   proposal for a long-term biomonitoring through a biological index.},

Title = {Carbon sequestration potential of second-growth forest regeneration in
   the Latin American tropics},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly
   complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in
   aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from
   deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other
   anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland
   second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their
   potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model
   shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered
   2.4 million km(2) of land (28.1\% of the total study area). Over 40
   years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon
   stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via
   low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to
   a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to
   carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of
   Latin America and the Caribbean from 1993 to 2014. Ten countries account
   for 95\% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia,
   Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide
   national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on
   40\% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over
   40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide
   national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of
   estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled
   with avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management, natural
   regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-cost mechanism that
   yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for
   biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {In Mexico, Pachyrhizus erosus (Fabaceae) commonly called ``jicama{''},
   is widely known for its edible tubers. It is cultivated since the
   pre-Columbian period, and the powdered seeds have been used for the
   treatment of mange, lice, and fleas, due to their content of rotenone, a
   well-known insecticidal compound. On the other hand, P. ferrugineus, a
   wild species can only be found in the Tropical Forests, and has no
   commercial value. It is known that plants release volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) showing qualitative and quantitative differences if are
   wild or cultivated. VOCs are also involved as repelling or attracting
   chemical signals to insect herbivores, and their natural enemies. Until
   now, the VOCs of the leaves of P. erosus and P. ferrugineus have not
   been investigated. In the present contribution the VOCs of both species
   were characterized by headspace solid-phase (HS-SPME) extraction and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS-TOF). In P. erosus 21 VOCs were
   found, being the most abundant: cyclohexanone (32.8\%), 3-hexen-1-ol (Z)
   (32.7\%), 3-hexenal (Z) (10.5\%). The majoritarian compounds were C6 or
   C5 derivatives In P. ferrugineus, the most abundant VOCs were:
   5-hexene-1-ol acetate (51.5\%), undecanal (22.4\%), 2-hepten-1-al
   (14.5\%). The majoritarian compounds were C6, C7 or C11 derivatives.},

Abstract = {This study is devoted to reveal a simple self-healing,
   diffusive-dissolution-like mechanism of transient pore's closing in a
   model spherical vesicle. It is based on a novel thermodynamic mechanism
   invented in terms of structural flux-force relations, with Onsager's
   coefficients reflecting the mainand cross-effects of nearly
   one-micrometer-in-diameter pore formation (of linear cross sectional
   size r) immersed within the membrane of a spherical vesicle of at least
   several tens of micrometer in its radius (R). The closing nanoscopic
   limit is given by r -> 0. The pore's formation is envisaged as a kind of
   bending and excess-area bearing (randomly occurring) failure,
   contrasting with a homogenizing action of the surface tension, trying to
   recover an even distribution of the elastic energy accumulated in the
   membrane. The failure yields at random the subsequent transient pore of
   a certain characteristic length along which the solution leaks out, with
   some appreciable speed, until the passage is ultimately closed within a
   suitable time interval. Inside such a time span, the system relaxes back
   toward its local equilibrium and uncompressed state until which the pore
   dissolves, and the before mentioned excess area vanishes. The (slow and
   non-exponential) relaxation-dissolution behavior bears a diffusion
   fingerprint, and it can be related with varying osmotic-pressure
   conditions. Useful connotations with a qualitatively similar
   biolubrication mechanism in articulating (micelles-containing) systems,
   down to the nanoscale, have also been pointed out.},

Title = {Tracking host use by bat ectoparasites with stable isotope analysis},
Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Number = {5},
Pages = {353-360},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We used C and N stable isotopes of nectarivorous bats and their
   ectoparasites to determine the extent to which parasites depend on the
   host individual for food. The difference in stable isotope values
   between parasites and host tissues (Delta C-13 and Delta N-15) was used
   as a proxy of host use. First, we tested the hypothesis that movement
   among individual Mexican long-tongued bats (Choeronycteris mexicana
   Tschudi, 1844) is more likely to occur in winged flies than in mites as
   indicated by higher host-parasite isotopic Euclidian distance (ED).
   Second, we tested the hypothesis that ectoparasite species in two
   coexisting bat species representing the C-3 (Geoffroy's tailless bat,
   Anoura geoffroyi Gray, 1838) and the CAM (lesser long-nosed bat,
   Leptonycteris yerbabuenae Martinez and Villa-R., 1940) food chains were
   monoxenous as indicated by their isotopic values. We also examined Delta
   C-13 and Delta N-15 of individual parasites in relation to C-13 and N-15
   reference enrichment factors as an indication of host switching. In
   general, flies in C. mexicana had higher ED and wider ranges of
   individual Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 than mites, suggesting that host
   switching occurred to a larger extent. Most ectoparasites species
   collected in both coexisting bats were monoxenous, but one fly species
   appears to be oligoxenous. Individual Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 values
   varied widely in these parasite species, suggesting movements within
   species hosts.},

Abstract = {The nucleolus is a nuclear organelle involved in ribosome biogenesis. In
   most eukaryotes this structure disperses during prophase through
   anaphase and reorganizes at telophase by a process known as
   nucleologenesis. This process involves new transcription of ribosomal
   DNA at the nucleolar organizer region and the formation of prenucleolar
   bodies fusing to it. In Giardia lamblia, for a long time considered the
   only anucleolated eukaryote, a very small nucleolus has been recently
   described. In order to evaluate whether nucleologenesis is also present
   in Giardia, we analyzed the distribution of nucleolar material during
   telophase using different light and electron microscopy techniques
   including silver staining for the nucleolar organizer. Results indicate
   that in G. lamblia, nucleolar elements persist mainly as an intranuclear
   peripheral organelle during all stages of division, including telophase,
   however, no prenucleolar bodies are detected in the nucleoplasm.
   Therefore, in the parasite, nucleolar material is present throughout
   cell division including telophase and formation of prenucleolar bodies

Abstract = {The restudy of the Late Cretaceous rudist fauna of the Chiapas Central
   Depression, considered Campanian-Maastrichtian with no more precisions
   in literature, reveals that, in fact, three successive rudist
   assemblages occur: (1) a lower one, early and middle Campanian, in the
   uppermost part of the Sierra Madre Formation (distinguished as Suchiapa
   Formation); (2) a middle one, early Maastrichtian, in the upper part of
   the Ocozocoautla Formation; and (3) an upper one, late Maastrichtian, in
   several horizons within the Angostura Formation. Published data on
   planktic and benthic foraminifers and inoceramid bivalves, as well as
   new findings of ammonites, helped bracketing the age of the three rudist
   assemblages. Their stratigraphic position fits with a depositional model
   assuming a basal carbonate platform fragmented into blocks each
   following a different tecto-sedimentary evolution: (1) a drowned block
   constituting the Tuxtla Gutierrez Basin, deepening towards the neighbor
   raised block and receiving terrigenous material from the emerged Sierra
   Madre de Chiapas, that, after a long hiatus, was filled up and,
   subsequently, a marginal shallow carbonate platform, surrounded by a
   detritic belt and prograding towards the basin, installed on top; (2) a
   raised block constituting a high where, after a long hiatus, an insular
   shallow carbonate platform installed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The Effects of Wind on Upwelling off Cabo Catoche},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {638-650},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters at the NE corner of the Yucatan
   Peninsula is known to enhance productivity over the Yucatan Shelf,
   fueling fisheries and harboring the largest global aggregation of whale
   sharks. Nevertheless, the physical processes that control this upwelling
   and the spreading of upwelled waters onto the Yucatan Shelf are not well
   known, particularly near the coast. In this study, upwelling behavior
   close to the coast was characterized, and the contribution of wind was
   assessed. Time series of wind, air and ocean temperatures, sea level,
   and current velocities from two moorings were analyzed. Wavelet
   transforms showed cold-water pulses with timescales that vary across the
   seasons and also between the shallower site (8 m) and the deeper site
   (12 m), with a broader range of periodicities observed further offshore.
   These upwelling pulses do not correlate simply with wind-driven Ekman
   transport, suggesting that the process is not locally controlled.
   Temperature covaried with horizontal currents, suggesting an advective
   mechanism, which is related to the wind. Although local winds may at
   times enhance the nearshore intrusion of upwelled waters along the
   northern shore of the Yucatan Peninsula, more important in these data
   was the disappearance of cold waters during northerly winds. This
   appears as an interruption of upwelling, which was highly coherent at
   periods of 7 to 16 days. These northerly winds are typical from October
   to February, but can occur at other times as well, for example during an
   intensive field campaign in April 2012.},

Abstract = {A beach segment on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where
   sandy beaches have widespread erosion problems, was studied with
   morphodynamic numerical simulations to identify the most appropriate
   protection scheme for mitigating coastal erosion in the region. The
   numerical model Delft3D was used to model hydro-morphodynamic patterns.
   Three types of solution were simulated: (1) beach nourishment only, (2)
   beach nourishment and groynes (linear, Y- and T-shaped), and (3) beach
   nourishment and offshore breakwaters. Measured time series of wind, sea
   level, and shelf currents were fed into the numerical model.
   Morphodynamic simulations were validated by comparing the modelled
   volumetric changes with those observed from beach profiles. The
   morphodynamic evolution was evaluated using bottom depth contour maps,
   and a volumetric sand balance and sand flux analysis identified which
   scheme retained more sand in the littoral system. The protection scheme
   with linear groynes showed greater sand retention in the short term, but
   in the medium term, this solution enhanced beach erosion. The numerical
   simulations showed that beach nourishment performs better than linear
   groynes in the long term and have beneficial downdrift effects.
   Nevertheless, T groynes had the smallest loss of sand nourishment in the
   short and long terms, suggesting that this scheme could best retain
   sand, although exacerbating erosion in downdrift beaches. From a cost
   analysis perspective, T groynes show a lower maintenance cost than beach
   nourishment and linear groynes.},

Abstract = {PM2.5 samples were collected at two urban sites (Parque Morelos (PQM)
   and CECyTE (CEC)) in Tijuana during the Cal-Mex campaign from May 24 to
   June 5, 2010. Concentration of trace elements (Mg, Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe,
   Co, Ni, Zn, Cu, Ga, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, La, Ce, and Pb),
   and Pb isotopic composition were determined in order to study the
   sources of PM impacting each site. Other chemical analysis (gravimetric,
   elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs)), were also performed. Finally, back-trajectories
   were calculated to facilitate the interpretation of the chemical data.
   Trace elements results show that CEC is a receptor site affected by
   mixed regional sources: sea salt, mineral, urban, and industrial. On the
   other hand, PQM seems to be impacted mainly by local sources. In
   particular, Pb at CEC is of anthropogenic, as well as crustal origin.
   This conclusion is supported by the lead isotopic composition, whose
   values are consistent with a combination of lead extracted from US
   mines, and lead from bedrocks in the Mexican Sierras. Some of the time
   variability observed can be explained using the back-trajectories. (C)

Abstract = {From the Santiago Ixtaltepec area, in Oaxaca State, southern Mexico, 11
   species of productoid brachiopods, including a new genus and five new
   species, are described. Semicostella sp., Antiquatonia sp., Keokukia?
   sp., Inflatia inflata, Reticulatia cf. R. huecoensis, Buxtonia websteri,
   Weberproductus donajiae n. gen. n. sp., Dictyoclostus transversum n.
   sp., Inflatia coodzavuii n. sp., Buxtonia inexpletucosta n. sp., and
   Flexaria magna n. sp. were collected from eight stratigraphic levels of
   the Ixtaltepec Formation. The presence of Semicostella sp., Keokukia?
   sp. and Inflatia inflata in the basal strata, Units 1 to 3, of the
   formation indicate a Visean-Serpukhovian (Late Mississippian) age.
   Reticulatia cf. R. huecoensis and Buxtonia websteri, found in Units 6 to
   8, confirm the Pennsylvanian age for upper strata of the Ixtaltepec
   Formation. Inflatia and Flexaria are present in the uppermost beds of
   the formation so it is possible to extend their upper stratigraphic
   range to the Middle Pennsylvanian. All these taxa also occur in the
   United States Midcontinent, suggesting that during the Carboniferous the
   epicontinental sea extended at least to central Mexico.},

Title = {Unique Fock quantization of a massive fermion field in a cosmological
   scenario},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {It is well known that the Fock quantization of field theories in general
   spacetimes suffers from an infinite ambiguity, owing to the inequivalent
   possibilities in the selection of a representation of the canonical
   commutation or anticommutation relations, but also owing to the freedom
   in the choice of variables to describe the field among all those related
   by linear time-dependent transformations, including the dependence
   through functions of the background. In this work we remove this
   ambiguity (up to unitary equivalence) in the case of a massive Dirac
   free field propagating in a spacetime with homogeneous and isotropic
   spatial sections of spherical topology. Two physically reasonable
   conditions are imposed in order to arrive at this result: (a) The
   invariance of the vacuum under the spatial isometries of the background,
   and (b) the unitary implementability of the dynamical evolution that
   dictates the Dirac equation. We characterize the Fock quantizations with
   a nontrivial fermion dynamics that satisfy these two conditions. Then,
   we provide a complete proof of the unitary equivalence of the
   representations in this class under very mild requirements on the time
   variation of the background, once a criterion to discern between
   particles and antiparticles has been set.},

Title = {Wind-driven coastal upwelling and westward circulation in the Yucatan
   shelf},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {63-76},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The wind-driven circulation and wind-induced coastal upwelling in a
   large shelf sea with a zonally oriented coast are examined. The Yucatan
   shelf is located to the north of the Yucatan peninsula in the eastern
   Gulf of Mexico. This area is a tropical shallow body of water with a
   smooth sloping bottom and is one of the largest shelves in the world.
   This study describes the wind-driven circulation and wind induced
   coastal upwelling in the Yucatan shelf, which is forced by easterly
   winds throughout the year. Data obtained from hydrographic surveys,
   acoustic current profilers and environmental satellites are used in the
   analysis. Hydrographic data was analyzed and geostrophic currents were
   calculated in each survey. In addition an analytical model was applied
   to reproduce the currents. The results of a general circulation model
   were used with an empirical orthogonal function analysis to study the
   variability of the currents. The study area is divided in two regions:
   from the 40 m to the 200 m isobaths (outer shelf) and from the coast to
   the 40 m isobath (inner shelf). At the outer shelf, observations
   revealed upwelling events throughout the year, and a westward current
   with velocities of approximately 0.2 m s(-1) was calculated from the
   numerical model output and hydrographic data. In addition, the theory
   developed by Pedlosky (2007) for a stratified fluid along a sloping
   bottom adequately explains the current's primary characteristics. The
   momentum of the current comes from the wind, and the stratification is
   an important factor in its dynamics. At the inner shelf, observations
   and numerical model output show a wind driven westward current with
   maximum velocities of 0.20 m s(-1). The momentum balance in this region
   is between local acceleration and friction. A cold-water band is
   developed during the period of maximum upwelling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {We present a study exploring the range of applicability of a generalized
   Fick Jacobs equation in the case when diffusive mass transport of a
   fluid along a pore includes chemical reactions in the bulk and pore's
   surface. The study contemplates nonequilibrium boundary conditions and
   emphasizes the comparison between the predictions coming from the
   projected Fick Jacobs description and the corresponding predictions of
   the original two-dimensional mass balance equation, establishing a
   simple quantitative criterion of validity of the projected description.
   For the adsorption desorption process, we demonstrate that the length
   and the local curvature of the pore are the relevant geometric
   quantities for its description, allowing for giving very precise
   predictions of the mass concentration along the pore. Some schematic
   cases involving adsorption and chemical reaction are used to quantify
   with detail the concentration profiles in transient and stationary
   states involving equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. Our approach
   provides novel and important insights into the study of diffusion and
   adsorption in confined geometries.},

Abstract = {We describe a new species of Rhadinella from the Sierra Madre del Sur of

   diminutive species is a member of a group of snakes previously allocated

   genus Rhadinella. These snakes may have conspicuous dark longitudinal
   striping on a pale brown to orange background or may have dark brown to
   blackish dorsal ground coloration, which mostly or completely obfuscates
   a pattern of longitudinal striping. The new species is mostly dark with
   barely discernible slightly paler or darker striping (depending on how
   striping is interpreted). The closest relative of the new species, on
   the basis of morphological similarities and biogeography, appears to be
   Rhadinella donaji which occurs to the east in the Sierra Madre del Sur
   of Oaxaca about 275 km from the type-locality of the new species.},

Abstract = {A set of vertical bars planted on given points of a horizontal line
   defines a fence composed of the quadrilaterals bounded by successive
   bars. A set of bars in the plane, each having one endpoint at the

   successive bars. Given a collection of bars, we study how to use them to
   build the fence or the umbrella of maximum total area. We present
   optimal algorithms for these constructions. The problems introduced in
   this paper are related to the Geometric Knapsack problems (Arkin et al.

Abstract = {We evaluated the effect of arthropod presence on the growth of
   Tillandsia violacea in a Quercus spp.-Abies religiosa forest in Hidalgo,
   Mexico. We used 40 T. violacea individuals (<20 cm in diameter) attached
   to Quercus spp. trees. Insecticide was sprayed weekly on 20 plants
   during 1 y, another set of 20 plants located 100 m away were not
   sprayed. Both leaf number (N) and length (L) were recorded every 2 mo,
   and the foliar load was obtained. We found lower leaf production, leaf
   length, and foliar load in plants sprayed with insecticide than in
   nonsprayed plants. Our results show arthropod presence increases plant
   growth. We suggest this is due to the fragmentation activity of
   arthropods on litter, which promotes the decomposition process of the
   organic matter accumulated in epiphytes and increases nutrient release
   to the plant.},

Title = {Is Direct Seeding a Biologically Viable Strategy for Restoring Forest
   Ecosystems? Evidences from a Meta-analysis},
Journal = {LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Ecological restoration has become an important technique for mitigating
   the human impacts on natural vegetation. Planting seedlings is the most
   common approach to regain lost forest cover. However, these activities
   require a large economic investment. Direct seeding is considered a
   cheaper and easier alternative technique, in which tree seeds are
   introduced directly on the site rather than transplanting seedlings from
   nurseries. To evaluate the effectiveness of direct seeding, we conducted
   a comprehensive search of the literature using restoration', direct
   seeding' and sowing' as keywords, and we performed a meta-analysis using
   30 papers and 89 species. We used two different measures of restoration
   success: seed germination probability and success probability (the
   chance that a seed germinates and survives until the end of the
   experiment). In general, restoration attempts using direct-seeding
   techniques were relatively unsuccessful. On average, seed germination
   and success probability were 0239 and 0114, respectively, and were not
   affected by climate, species successional group or the application of
   pre-germinative treatments. Germination and success probability
   increased with seed size, and the use of physical protections resulted
   in a nearly twofold increase in germination probability, but this effect
   faded by the end of the experiments. Because of the low rate of seedling
   success, we suggest the use of direct seeding as a complementary
   technique to reduce restoration costs, particularly for species with
   large seeds and known high germination rates, but our results do not
   support direct seeding as a substitute for seedling planting. Copyright

Title = {Mineral chemistry and geochemistry of mantle xenoliths from the Santo

Abstract = {The Santo Domingo volcanic field consists of at least four Quaternary
   maars: Santo Domingo, Joya de los Contreras, El Banco and Joya Prieta,
   as well as a cinder cone and associated lava flows (La Polvora). Mantle
   peridotites - mainly spinel lherzolite occur as xenoliths that were
   carried to the surface by mafic alkalic intraplate magmas. Outstanding
   features of the xenoliths of Santo Domingo, compared with other xenolith
   localities in central and northern Mexico, are the porphyroclastic
   texture, abundance of kaersutite megacrysts. Composite xenoliths,
   wherein hornblendite veinlets cut across the foliation in the
   peridotite, show that the hydrated phases come from the mantle.
   Composite xenoliths, where hornblende veinlets cut across the mylonitic
   foliation in the peridotite, show that the hydrated phases come from the
   mantle.
   Xenoliths of sheared peridotites collected at Joya de los Contreras,
   Santo Domingo and Joya Prieta maars display modal metasomatism evidenced
   by the presence, to a greater or lesser extent, of crystals of amphibole
   (kaersutite and/or pargasite) and phlogopite. The hydrated phases are
   spatially associated with spinel and/or clinopyroxene crystals.
   All the studied mantle xenoliths contain trace amounts of Ni-rich
   sulphides, which have irregular- or bleb-like shapes. Sulphides occur in
   the intracrystalline spaces of olivine crystals or as isolated
   inclusions in clinopyroxene. Sulphides in mantle xenoliths from Mexico
   have not been previously reported.
   There is clear evidence of interaction with fluids in the mantle
   xenoliths from the Santo Domingo volcanic field. However, metasomatism
   was not pervasive in the mantle region where the xenoliths were
   incorporated in the transporting magma. The most important clues about
   how the mantle was metasomatized are the presence of hornblendite
   veinlets in some of the peridotites and the occurrence of kaersutite
   megacrysts. The veinlets indicate that the metasomatism was developed in
   the upper mantle and the occurrence of some peridotites with
   disseminated hydrous minerals, as well as peridotites with cryptic
   metasomatism, suggest the existence of zoning in a metasomatic aureole
   around the veinlets. Hornblendite dikes originated from magmas related
   to the first pulses of intraplate magmatism in the region.},

Abstract = {Oxidative enzymes secreted by white rot fungi can be applied in several
   technological processes within the paper industry, biofuel production
   and bioremediation. The discovery of native strains from the biodiverse
   Misiones (Argentina) forest can provide useful enzymes for
   biotechnological purposes. In this work, we evaluated the laccase and
   manganese peroxidase secretion abilities of four newly discovered
   strains of Trametes sp. that are native to Misiones. In addition, the
   copper response and optimal pH and temperature for laccase activity in
   culture supernatants were determined.
   The selected strains produced variable amounts of laccase and MnP; when
   Cu2+ was added, both enzymes were significantly increased. Zymograms
   showed that two isoenzymes were increased in all strains in the presence
   of Cu2+. Strain B showed the greatest response to Cu2+ addition, whereas
   strain A was more stable at the optimal temperature and pH. Strain A
   showed interesting potential for future biotechnological approaches due
   to the superior thermo-stability of its secreted enzymes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {In this work we present a theoretical study of the adsorption Mn-2 dimer
   on the Au(111) surface. Here we use the density functional theory to
   construct a map of adsorption energies, E-A, of Mn-2 on a Au(111)
   surface as a function of interatomic bond distance, d(mn-mn), among Mn
   atoms. We employed a 4 x 4 supercell of Au(111) surface which lead us to
   reach d(mn-mn) values in the range from 2.6 to 6.8 A. To make a full
   study of the adsorption energies we considered the antiferromagnetic
   (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) states of the Mn-2 on the surface. The
   energy landscape contains local minima when the Mn atoms are adsorbed
   above triangular sites and barriers that the Mn adatoms have to overcome
   when they move across the Au(111) surface along various paths. Our
   results show that the lowest energy state corresponds to the state in
   which the Mn atoms are next-nearest neighbors and are
   antiferromagnetically coupled. Furthermore, all the local minima with
   higher bonding energy are also those in the antiferromagnetic state.
   Nevertheless we find a short interval in which the FM state has lower
   energy than the AFM one. Finally, scanning tunneling microscope
   simulations for various dimer configurations on surface are reported.

Title = {Persistence of Reduced Androgenic Glands after Protandric Sex Change
   Suggests a Basis for Simultaneous Hermaphroditism in a Caridean Shrimp},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN},

Volume = {230},

Abstract = {The caridean shrimp Lysmata wurdemanni is a protandric simultaneous
   hermaphrodite. These individuals go through a male phase (MP) before
   changing sex to become female-phase simultaneous hermaphrodites (FPSH).
   The latter have an externally female phenotype, but retain a reduced
   male reproductive system and both male and female reproductive function.
   Previous studies have reported that the androgenic glands (AGs), whose
   hormones stimulate development of male characteristics in decapod
   crustaceans, are absent in the female phase of purely protandric
   species. We tested the hypothesis of androgenic gland persistence in
   FPSHs of L. wurdemanni by dissection and histology on the ejaculatory
   ducts. These glands were observed in FPSHs, although in a variably
   atrophied form. Androgenic glands of L. wurdemanni MPs are compact and
   replete with well developed cells, with large, deeply stained
   (hematoxylin-eosin) nuclei, as in males of gonochoric and protandric
   species. The AGs of simultaneous hermaphrodites were more reticulate in
   appearance due to the apparent breakdown and loss of cells, resulting in
   vacuolated areas, or empty spaces in the gland surrounded by connective
   tissue fibers or cell remnants. However, all FPSHs possessed numerous,
   or at least some possibly functional cells. The greatest atrophy of AGs
   was observed in the largest (i.e., oldest) FPSHs. However, the ovotestes
   of all FPSHs retained a small testicular portion with well developed
   ejaculatory ducts containing sperm. Our results suggest that the reduced
   androgenic glands of female-phase simultaneous hermaphrodites of L.
   wurdemanni allow them to maintain male reproductive function after sex
   change.},

Abstract = {Photothermal therapy has shown to be a promising technique for local
   treatment of tumors. However, the main challenge for this technique is
   the availability of localized heat sources to minimize thermal damage in
   the surrounding healthy tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the use of
   optical fiber microheaters for inducing thermal lesions in soft tissue.
   The proposed devices incorporate carbon nanotubes or gold nanolayers on
   the tips of optical fibers for enhanced photothermal effects and heating
   of ex vivo biological tissues. We report preliminary results of small
   size photothermal lesions induced on mice liver tissues. The morphology
   of the resulting lesions shows that optical fiber microheaters may
   render useful for delivering highly localized heat for photothermal
   therapy. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America},

Title = {Photothermal Effects and Applications of Polydimethylsiloxane Membranes
   with Carbon Nanoparticles},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The advent of nanotechnology has triggered novel developments and
   applications for polymer-based membranes with embedded or coated
   nanoparticles. As an example, interaction of laser radiation with
   metallic and carbon nanoparticles has shown to provide optically
   triggered responses in otherwise transparent media. Incorporation of
   these materials inside polymers has led to generation of plasmonic and
   photothermal effects through the enhanced optical absorption of these
   polymer composites. In this work, we focus on the photothermal effects
   produced in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes with embedded carbon
   nanoparticles via light absorption. Relevant physical parameters of
   these composites, such as nanoparticle concentration, density, geometry
   and dimensions, are used to analyze the photothermal features of the
   membranes. In particular, we analyze the heat generation and conduction
   in the membranes, showing that different effects can be achieved and
   controlled depending on the physical and thermal properties of the
   composite material. Several novel applications of these light responsive
   membranes are also demonstrated, including low-power laser-assisted
   micro-patterning and optomechanical deformation. Furthermore, we show
   that these polymer-nanoparticle composites can also be used as coatings
   in photonic and microfluidic applications, thereby offering an
   attractive platform for developing light-activated photonic and
   optofluidic devices.},

Abstract = {The sludge generated in the treatment of surface water for human
   consumption represents an environmental hazard which can be mitigated by
   the valorisation of this solid waste. This paper presents an analysis of
   the process parameters and physicochemical mechanisms involved in the
   elaboration of a glass-ceramic foam using clay and the sludge generated
   in a drinking water plant. Optimisation of the process conditions was
   performed by a 33 experimental design. For structural purposes,
   compression strength is the optimising parameter; if used as a catalytic
   support or filtering medium, porosity and permeability have to be
   maximised. An open cellular structure can be obtained when the materials
   are fired in a mould which allows the coexistence of solid, liquid and
   gas phases. The latter are responsible for foaming and were identified
   as CO2, SO2 and H2O. Thermogravimetric analysis coupled to mass
   spectrometry and Mossbauer spectroscopy show that CO2 was generated
   mainly from pyrolysis, SO2 was generated from aluminium sulphate used as
   a coagulant in the drinking water treatment but H2O resulting from the
   decomposition of lepidocrocite at high temperature is likely to be the
   main agent for the foaming effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Systems whose dynamics result from the existence of a wide variety of
   time and length scales frequently exhibit slow relaxation behavior,
   manifested through the aging compartment of the correlations and the
   nonexponential decay of the response function. Experiments performed in
   systems such as amorphous polymers and supercooled liquids and glasses
   seem to indicate that these systems undergo, in general, non-Markovian
   and nonstationary dynamics. Hence, in this contribution, we present a
   dynamical description of slow relaxation systems based on a
   generalization of Onsager's theory to nonequilibrium aging states. By
   assuming the existence of a local quasi-equilibrium state characterized
   by a nonstationary probability distribution the entropy of the system is
   expressed in terms of the conditional probability density by means of
   the Gibbs entropy postulate. Thus, by taking into account probability
   conservation and the rules of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the
   generalized Fokker-Planck equation is derived.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NANOPHOTONICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We studied the limits of optical reflectance to detect plasmonic
   nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in air and supported by a glass substrate,
   in an internal reflection configuration. We used a recently derived
   multiple-scattering model for the coherent reflectance of a disordered
   monolayer of particles supported on a flat surface to calculate the
   sensitivity of optical reflectance variations to the presence of
   plasmonic NPs. We considered gold and silver NPs with radii up to 50 nm
   and studied the sensitivity as a function of the angle of incidence,
   wavelength, particle size, and polarization of light. Using our own
   measurements of noise, we estimated the minimum detectable
   surface-coverage by the particles. The highest sensitivity is found
   around the critical angle between the glass substrate and air, for
   transverse-magnetic polarization, and at wavelengths of light near the
   plasmon resonance of the particles. We provide estimates of the minimum
   number of particles per unit area detectable from reflectivity
   variations and set the basis for single particle detection. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Magnetron sputtering is widely used to deposit thin films on different
   types of substrates. An important application of this method is to make
   multicomponent thin films using co-sputtering, where two or more
   elements are included in the target. The thickness and elemental
   composition of the films depend on the experimental parameters used, the
   system geometry and the spatial distribution of the elements in the
   target. If the target is made of two spatially separate pieces of the
   materials, then the composition of the deposit depends on a combination
   of the relative areas, the sputtering yield and the angular distribution
   of the emission of the sputtered flux of each material. In this work, a
   co-sputtering simulation program, known as CO-SS, was developed to
   simulate the thickness and composition of metal films produced by DC
   magnetron sputtering (Al) and co-sputtering (Al + Ti). The CO-SS code
   models the angular distribution of particles ejected by sputtering from
   the target, where this is assumed to vary as cos(n) beta, where n is a
   free parameter and beta is the angle of ejection relative to the normal
   to the surface of the target, and the sputtering yield of each material.
   The program also takes into account other geometry factors such as the
   distance between the target and the substrate, and the size of the
   substrate.
   Rutherford backscattering (RBS) using He-4 was employed to measure the
   thickness and the composition of the films deposited on glass cover
   slides in order to assess the CO-SS program. The film thickness was also
   measured by profilometry. The CO-SS code was found to accurately model
   the experimental results for both the Al and Ti/Al films. The CO-SS code
   is freely available for use from

Abstract = {Optimum temperatures can be measured through aerobic scope, preferred
   temperatures or growth. A complete thermal window, including optimum,
   transition (Pejus) and critical temperatures (CT), can be described if
   preferred temperatures and CT are defined. The crustacean Hemigrapsus
   crenulatus was used as a model species to evaluate the effect of
   acclimation temperature on: (i) thermal preference and width of thermal
   window, (ii) respiratory metabolism, and (iii) haemolymph proteins.
   Dependant on acclimation temperature, preferred temperature was between
   11.8 degrees C and 25.2 degrees C while CT was found between a minimum
   of 2.7 degrees C (CTmin) and a maximum of 35.9 degrees C (CTmax). These
   data and data from tropical and temperate crustaceans were compared to
   examine the association between environmental temperature and thermal
   tolerance. Temperate species have a CTmax limit around 35 degrees C that
   corresponded with the low CTmax limit of tropical species (34-36 degrees
   C). Tropical species showed a CTmin limit around 9 degrees C similar to
   the maximum CTmin of temperate species (5-6 degrees C). The maximum
   CTmin of deep sea species that occur in cold environments (2.5 degrees
   C) matched the low CTmin values (3.2 degrees C) of temperate species.
   Results also indicate that the energy required to activate the enzyme
   complex (Ei) involved in respiratory metabolism of ectotherms changes
   along the latitudinal gradient of temperature.},

Abstract = {The type specimens of amphibians and reptiles of the Museo de Historia
   Natural Alfredo Duges, at the University of Guanajuato (MADUG) were
   reviewed following Smith \& Necker's (1943) summary. Owing to this
   collection's eventful history and its historical importance as the
   oldest herpetological collection in Mexico, a review of its conservation
   status was needed. After many years, the collection has received proper
   recognition at the University of Guanajuato with a portion of the
   herpetological types considered ``Precious Assets{''} of the university.
   We found 34 type specimens pertaining to 18 taxa; six are additional
   specimens to those previously reported; six herpetological types are
   missing, including the body of the type of Adelophis copei. All
   specimens are in good to reasonable condition except for the type of
   Rhinocheilus antonii, which has dried out completely. All specimens are
   illustrated to show their condition.},

Abstract = {C-14-AMS of total carbon was determined in aerosols (PM10 fraction),
   collected in Mexico City during two weeks from 21 November to 3 December
   2012. Other tracers such as total carbon (TC), organic carbon (OC),
   elemental carbon (EC) and trace element contents were also determined.
   (FC)-C-14 values varied from 0.39 to 0.48 with an average of 0.43. These
   values are slightly lower than those previously obtained for PM2.5 in
   2003 and 2006 and reflect a high contribution of fossil CO2 to the
   carbonaceous matter in aerosols from Mexico City. In contrast, from 2006
   to 2012 PM10 increased; EC, Ca, Ti and Fe concentrations remained
   constant, while OC, TC and I( concentrations decreased. The use of
   potassium as an indicator of biomass burning showed that this source was
   negligible during this campaign. Combined analytical approaches allowed
   us to distinguish temporal variations of anthropogenic and natural
   inputs to the (FC)-C-14. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Role of matrix metalloproteinases in the pathogenesis of idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis},
Journal = {RESPIRATORY RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating
   lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no
   effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation
   of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved
   in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to
   myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular
   matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively
   produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may
   contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms.
   Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the
   extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and
   activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell
   surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion,
   proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and
   apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound
   impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development
   of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence
   regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as
   in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The current concept of areas of endemism assumes that they are
   geographic areas where there is spatial congruence of at least two
   endemic taxa. When this congruence is non-random, areas of endemism are
   explained by historical and ecological factors. Space has been the main
   dimension of analysis of areas of endemism, and the role of the time
   dimension in areas of endemism remains unclear. Phylogenetic information
   is a source of temporal information to explore the structure of the
   areas of endemism. I review the concept of areas of endemism and discuss
   their conceptual models (structure and boundaries). I propose four
   scenarios about the structural integration of endemic taxa in the
   space-time dimensions into areas of endemism. A better understanding of
   how to interpret areas of endemism can be analysed using phylogenetic
   information from endemic taxa to test simultaneous divergence and to
   propose temporal strata. Although the evolutionary relationships of the
   space and time dimensions have rarely been characterized in areas of
   endemism, I used this conceptual framework to interpret the Andean area
   of endemism and its evolution.},

Title = {Day-night variations in pro-oxidant reactions of hypothalamic, hepatic

Abstract = {Objectives: The present work compares the pro-oxidant properties in
   hypothalamic, hepatic, and pancreatic tissue of spontaneously obese and
   lean Neotomodon alstoni during day and night. Methods: Lipid
   peroxidation from hypothalamus, liver, and pancreas from lean and obese
   mice were quantified by the two-thiobarbituric acid method. Lipid
   peroxidation in vivo was also determined by means of detection of
   conjugated dienes in lipid extracts. Results: Hypothalamic tissue from
   obese Neotomodon showed a notorious increase (nearly 700\%) in the
   production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) at day,
   either in basal as well as in an assay supplemented with Fe2+; the
   presence of conjugated dienes was also notably greater (76\%) at day.
   Hypothalamus of lean mice presented an increase (170\%) in assay
   supplemented with Fe2+. Hepatic tissue in obese mice showed diurnal
   increasing in TBARS+Fe2+ (34\%) and in conjugated dienes (38\%), while
   lean mice showed only a diurnal increase (45\%) in TBARS+Fe2+.
   Pancreatic tissue from obese mice presented a diurnal increasing in
   basal TBARS (130\%) but a decrease (72\%) in TBARS+Fe2+. Presence of
   conjugated dienes was also decreased during the day in lean (60\%) and
   in obese (40\%) mice. Conclusions: In the obese Neotomodon, there is a
   larger day-night change in pro-oxidant status in the hypothalamus and in
   pancreas than the one observed in the liver, suggesting a differential
   equilibrium between oxidative reactions and antioxidant defenses in the
   different tissues during the day-night cycle.},

Title = {Cigarette Smoke Enhances the Expression of Profibrotic Molecules in
   Alveolar Epithelial Cells},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disease
   of unknown etiology. A growing body of evidence indicates that it may
   result from an aberrant activation of alveolar epithelium, which induces
   the expansion of the fibroblast population, their differentiation to
   myofibroblasts and the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix.
   The mechanisms that activate the alveolar epithelium are unknown, but
   several studies indicate that smoking is the main environmental risk
   factor for the development of IPF. In this study we explored the effect
   of cigarette smoke on the gene expression profile and signaling pathways
   in alveolar epithelial cells. Lung epithelial cell line from human
   (A549), was exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 1, 3, and 5
   weeks at 1, 5 and 10\% and gene expression was evaluated by complete
   transcriptome microarrays. Signaling networks were analyzed with the
   Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. At 5 weeks of exposure, alveolar
   epithelial cells acquired a fibroblast-like phenotype. At this time,
   gene expression profile revealed a significant increase of more than
   1000 genes and deregulation of canonical signaling pathways such as
   TGF-beta and Wnt. Several profibrotic genes involved in EMT were
   over-expressed, and incomplete EMT was observed in these cells, and
   corroborated in mouse (MLE-12) and rat (RLE-6TN) epithelial cells. The
   secretion of activated TGF-beta 1 increased in cells exposed to
   cigarette smoke, which decreased when the integrin alpha v gene was
   silenced. These findings suggest that the exposure of alveolar
   epithelial cells to CSE induces the expression and release of a variety
   of profibrotic genes, and the activation of TGF-beta 1, which may
   explain at least partially, the increased risk of developing IPF in
   smokers.},

Abstract = {A newly discovered species of arboreal alligator lizard of the genus
   Abronia is described from the Sierra Madre del Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico. It
   appears to be most closely related to A. mixteca and A. oaxacae, but
   differs from these species (and others in the subgenus Abronia) in a
   number of features, including the combination of having two primary
   temporals contacting the postocular series, the anterior superciliary
   contacting the cantholoreal, six to eight nuchals in a transverse row
   across the nape, minimally seven to eight scales between large nuchals
   and ventral scales on neck, and 32-35 transverse rows of dorsal scales.
   This new species is the only species of Abronia known from the central
   and western portions of the Sierra de Miahuatlan in the southern part of
   the Sierra Madre del Sur, although A. oaxacae occurs to the east in this
   range. Many of the arboreal and secretive species of Abronia have
   avoided discovery until relatively recently, with about a third of known
   species described in the last 3 decades.},

Abstract = {The generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) theory of
   superconductivity hinges on three distinct new ingredients: (a)
   treatment of Cooper pairs as real bosons, (b) inclusion of two-hole
   pairs on an equal footing with two-electron ones, and (c) insertion in
   the resulting ternary ideal boson-fermion gas of boson-fermion vertex
   interactions that drive formation/disintegration processes. Besides
   subsuming both BCS and BEC theories as well as the well-known crossover
   picture as special cases, GBEC leads to several-orders-of-magnitude
   enhancements in the critical superconducting temperature T (c) . The
   crossover picture is applicable also to ultracold atomic clouds, both
   bosonic and fermionic. But known low-density expansions involving the
   interatomic scattering length a diverge term-by-term around the
   so-called unitary zone about the Feshbach resonance where a itself
   diverges. However, expanding a in powers of the attractive part of the
   interatomic potential renders smooth, divergence-free low-density
   expansions whose convergence can be accelerated with Pad, approximants.},

Title = {A trade off in the absolute magnitudes of seed and microsite limitations
   and their effects on population regulation},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {125},
Number = {3},
Pages = {308-314},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Microsite limitation (ML) occurs when the number of suitable sites for
   development determines population size. Seed limitation (SL) arises when
   seeds cannot occupy all microsites. Both limitations have been measured
   on relative scales, but absolute values would allow analyzing the
   relationship between them and their contributions to population
   regulation. A tradeoff is expected because small-seeded species are
   prolific and thus could have low SL, whereas large seeds perform better
   under different conditions, lowering ML. We assessed whether there is
   such tradeoff, and if it is mediated by seed size. We measured the
   absolute magnitudes of limitations through seed addition experiments,
   and tested whether they determine population density in 14 herbs with
   different seed sizes in a semiarid grassland. All species were limited
   by microsites and seeds. The tradeoff occurred only during germination,
   but was seemingly not mediated by seed size. Annual species were more
   limited by microsites than perennials, which suffered more SL.
   Population densities were smaller for species with greater ML measured
   over the life cycle, but marginally so when ML was measured during
   germination. SL only reduced annual-plant density. These negative
   correlations indicate that our measurements correspond to actual
   limitations. Microsites limited populations depending on the process
   analyzed (germination, survival and whole life-cycle) and the life
   history of species, suggesting that an integral approach to ML is
   required rather than focusing only on germination. Comparing annuals and
   perennials, we found that the strongest limitation is the main
   determinant of population size. The tradeoff was consistent with seed
   size and competition-colonization tradeoff, but our results were
   inconclusive. The SL-ML tradeoff seems to arise from still-unidentified
   evolutionary constraints, and may contribute to the maintenance of
   species diversity, preventing any single species from becoming dominant
   and excluding its neighbors.},

Abstract = {New ornithomimid material discovered from the Upper Cretaceous Packard
   Shale Formation, (Cabullona Group) of Sonora, Mexico is described. The
   material includes a partial skeleton, which is assigned to a new genus
   and species, Totothnimus packardensis. This new taxon differs from other
   ornithomimids in having five unique characteristics that separate it
   from other Northamerican ornithomimids: (1) a distinctively articulation
   between metatarsals, where the distal ends of metatarsals II and IV
   contact directly with the distal facet of metatarsal III; (2) a
   metatarsal III with a weakly ginglymoid distal articular face; (3) the
   medial and lateral sides of metatarsal III are shaped into the form of
   metatarsals II and IV, so all distal ends fit together when they
   articulate; (4) an asymmetrical and narrow pedal ungual with shallow
   grooves in both medial and lateral sides; and finally, (5) the presence
   of a deep sulcus on the ventromedial edge, close to the articular end.
   Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Totodmimus packardensis corresponds
   to a derived ornithomimid included in the Northamerican clade, forming a
   monophyly with Ornithomimus. Totodmimus packardensis is the first
   definitive ornithomimid described for Mexico, and represents one of the
   southernmost occurrences in the Western Interior Basin of North America.

Abstract = {The municipality of San Juan Colorado is located in the southwestern
   part of the state of Oaxaca and has an approximate area of 86 km(2). The
   aim of this study was to elaborate a checklist of the monocots present
   in the zone, a place that has never been botanically explored before.
   Conventional methods of botanical collection were used. Specimens were
   collected at random in different places in the area. As a result, 23
   families, 81 genera and 139 species of monocots were found, the families
   best represented are Orchidaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae. With this
   study we contribute with new floristic information for the municipality,
   including 14 new records for Oaxaca (12 species, one subspecies and one
   variety). This work is the first floristic study in the municipality,
   and we report 50\% of the monocot families known to the country (23 of
   46) and 55\% to the state (23 of 42). All Rights Reserved (C) 2015

Abstract = {In this work we describe the algal diversity, which is in Los Hervideros
   geothermal spring, in Michoacan, Mexico, and its spatial distribution
   related with the thermal gradient. This spring forms a part of Los
   Azufres system, which is affected by volcanic activity from the
   Transversal Neovolcanic Belt. The species identification was
   morphological and physical and chemical parameters were measured as
   temperature, specific conductivity and pH. The temperature recorded was
   between 22.2 to 85.2 degrees C. The specific conductivity is as high as
   3,400 to 4,430 mu S cm(-1), while the pH is 7.5 to 8.0. The growth were
   dominated by the next Cyanophyceae species: Arthrospira sp.,
   Synechococcus sp. and Synechocystis sp. in temperatures from 22 to 76
   degrees C, respectively. As far as the Bacillariophyceae, we registered:
   Achnanthidium exiguum, Halamphora veneta, Anomoeoneis costata, Diploneis
   elliptica and Pinnularia viridis in temperatures from 22 to 55 degrees
   C. We also registered one Chlorophyceae species, Oedogonium sp. (30 to
   35 degrees C). This spring is characterized by the presence of great
   changes of temperate in a few centimeters, which is reflected in a
   heterogeneous distribution of the algal species. All Rights Reserved (C)

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, and usually
   fatal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The disease likely results from
   the interaction of genetic susceptibility architecture, environmental
   factors such as smoking, and an abnormal epigenetic reprogramming that
   leads to a complex pathogenesis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs in
   middle-aged and mainly elderly adults, and in this context age has
   emerged as its strongest risk factor. However, the mechanisms linking it
   to aging are uncertain. Recently, nine molecular and cellular hallmarks
   of aging have been proposed: genomic instability, telomere attrition,
   epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient
   sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell
   exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. In this review, we
   provide an overview of these molecular mechanisms and their involvement
   in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while emphasizing
   that the studies on this disease are few and the findings are not
   definitive.},

Abstract = {The distribution and abundance of species of Trochillidae family is
   usually influenced by the flowering and phenology of plants used as a
   feeding source, mainly in primary forest, so that changes in vegetation
   cover could impact their populations. We analyzed and characterized the
   geographical distribution and habitat for 22 species of resident
   hummingbirds in the state of Guerrero using the vegetation and the land
   use map of INEGI Series IV (2007-2010). Distribution models were
   generated with the Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production (GARP),
   using historical records of scientific collections and fieldwork
   (2001-2009), in combination with climatic and topographic variables. Of
   the 22 modeled species, six are endemic to Mexico, the same number of
   species found in a risk category. The highest concentration with regards
   to richness (14-20 species), endemism (5-6 species) and number of
   threatened species of hummingbirds (5-6 species) occurred in the biotic
   province of Sierra Madre del Sur. However, the potential distribution of
   most of the hummingbirds occurred in disturbed sites or agroecosystems,
   as a result of changes in land-use. For Campylopterus hemileucurus,
   Lamprolahna rhatni and Heliomaster longisrostris, their potential
   distribution was highest in areas of primary vegetation. Areas of high
   hummingbirds presence do not coincide with the Important Bird Areas
   proposed for bird conservation in Guerrero, considering that, despite
   its diversity and its extreme popularity, from the conservation
   perspective hummingbirds have received relatively little attention.},

Abstract = {We present a deterministic algorithm called contact density dynamics
   that generates any prescribed target distribution in the physical phase
   space. Akin to the famous model of Nose and Hoover, our algorithm is
   based on a non-Hamiltonian system in an extended phase space. However,
   the equations of motion in our case follow from contact geometry and we
   show that in general they have a similar form to those of the so-called
   density dynamics algorithm. As a prototypical example, we apply our
   algorithm to produce a Gibbs canonical distribution for a
   one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.},

Title = {Chemical Tools of Octopus maya during Crab Predation Are Also
   Active on Conspecifics},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Octopus maya is a major socio-economic resource from the Yucatan
   Peninsula in Mexico. In this study we report for the first time the
   chemical composition of the saliva of O. maya and its effect on natural
   prey, i.e. the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), the crown conch snail
   (Melongena corona bispinosa), as well as conspecifics. Salivary
   posterior glands were collected from octopus caught by local fishers and
   extracted with water; this extract paralyzed and predigested crabs when
   it was injected into the third pereiopod. The water extract was
   fractionated by membrane ultrafiltration with a molecular weight cut-off
   of 3kDa leading to a metabolic phase (>3kDa) and a neurotoxic fraction
   (<3kDa). The neurotoxic fraction injected in the crabs caused paralysis
   and postural changes. Crabs recovered to their initial condition within
   two hours, which suggests that the effects of the neurotoxic fraction
   were reversible. The neurotoxic fraction was also active on O. maya
   conspecifics, partly paralyzing and sedating them; this suggests that
   octopus saliva might be used among conspecifics for defense and for
   reduction of competition. Bioguided separation of the neurotoxic
   fraction by chromatography led to a paralysis fraction and a relaxing
   fraction. The paralyzing activity of the saliva was exerted by amino
   acids, while the relaxing activity was due to the presence of serotonin.
   Prey-handling studies revealed that O. maya punctures the eye or
   arthrodial membrane when predating blue crabs and uses the radula to
   bore through crown conch shells; these differing strategies may help O.
   maya to reduce the time needed to handle its prey.},

Title = {Medicinal plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment
   of colorectal cancer},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {391-402},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cancer cases numbers are increasing
   worldwide positioning this disease as the second cause of mortality for
   both sexes. Medicinal plants have been used in the fight against cancer
   as the basis for drug discovery and nowadays more than 70\% of
   anticancer drugs have a natural origin. Mexico is regarded for its
   cultural and biological diversity, which is reflected in the vast
   traditional knowledge of herbal remedies. In this review we examined
   herbal remedies employed in colorectal cancer treatment (CRC).
   Aim of the study: The goal of this work was to gather scientific reports
   of plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for CRC treatment.
   Materials and methods: We performed a search on scientific literature
   databases using as keywords: ``colon cancer{''}, ``gastric cancer{''},
   ``cytotoxicity{''}, studies ``in vitro and in vivo{''}, in combination
   with ``Mexican medicinal plants{''} or ``Mexican herbal remedies{''}.
   The selection criteria of cytotoxic activity for extracts or pure
   compounds was based on the National Cancer Institute of USA
   recommendations of effective dose 50 (ED50) of <= 20 mu g/mL and <= 4 mu
   g/ml respectively.
   Results: In this review we report 25 botanic families and 39 species of
   plants used for the treatment of colon cancer in Mexico with evidence in
   studies in vitro and in vivo.
   Conclusions: Medicinal plants are still a great source of novel chemical
   structures with antineoplastic potential as it is proven in this work.
   The selection criteria and activity was narrowed for methodological
   purposes, nevertheless, drug discovery of natural origin continues to be
   a highly attractive R\&D strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {Biomass resilience of Neotropical secondary forests},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {530},
Number = {7589},
Pages = {211+},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where
   the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large
   consequences for the global carbon cycle(1). However, considerable
   uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary
   forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and
   prior land use(2-4). Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during
   secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots
   covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The
   studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient.
   Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams
   per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg
   C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests.
   Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to
   90\% of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years
   varied 11.3-fold ( from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this
   recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and
   lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of
   Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in
   carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will
   support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass
   resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and
   promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland
   areas with high biomass resilience.},

Abstract = {Six new taxa of Campodeidae (Diplura) are described in the genera
   Litocampa, Juxtlacampa, Oncinocampa, and Tachycampa. We also redescribe
   the interesting species Juxtlacampa juxtlahucensis Wygodzinsky, 1944
   from Juxtlahuaca cave in Guerrero, Mexico. All of these taxa are
   cave-dwelling species with more or less noticeable troglobiomorphic
   features They inhabit the subterranean ecosystem in six limestone
   massifs and one lava tube cave in the central states of Mexico. Four of
   these species are included in the ``tachycampoide{''} group and one
   species in the ``podocampoide{''} group (sensu Bareth \& Conde). Nine
   species already known in Central and South America of the
   ``tachycampoide{''} group, in such poorly- sampled regions compared with
   the eight species in the well-sampled Mediterranean region
   (Ibero-Sardinia and north Africa), suggest an American origin for this
   group.},

   implications for fisheries management},
Journal = {MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-44},

Abstract = {Octopus maya is the main species caught in Mexico. From September 2007
   to June 2008, its sex ratio, reproductive season, frequency of
   non-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes, reproductive indices, and
   size and weight at maturity, were evaluated. The monthly sex ratio was
   significantly different from 1:1. The major reproductive season occurs
   during February to June (dry season) in Yucatan. May-June is the common
   reproductive season to both Yucatan and Campeche populations. Higher
   frequencies of vitellogenic oocytes (> 50\%) were found from
   January-March and in May. From five reproductive indices, only the
   macroscopic and microscopic maturity indices were the best descriptors
   of the reproductive season in females, whilst only the reproductive
   complex index was the best descriptor in males. The weight at sexual
   maturity (BW50\%) was 335 g for females and 242 g for males. The size at
   sexual maturity (DML50\%) was 12.58 cm for females and 7.42 cm for
   males. It is recommend revising the minimum catch size by following
   these results. The reproductive traits here evaluated could contribute
   to the recently created Plan for Management of Octopus Fisheries, in
   particular action line no. 1.4, which refers to protection of females
   during breeding, and to their protection throughout the entire
   reproductive season.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS \& CONTROL},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {At present, network control systems employ a common approximation to
   solve the connectivity issue due to time delays coupled with external
   factors. However, this approach tends to be complex in terms of time
   delays, and the inherent local phase is missing. Therefore, it is
   necessary to study the behavior of the delays as well as the integration
   of the differential equations of these bounded delays. The related time
   delays need to be known a priori, but from a dynamic real-time
   perspective in order to understand the dynamic phase behavior. The
   objective of this paper is to demonstrate the inclusion of the data
   frequency transmission and time delays that are bounded as parameters of
   the dynamic response from a real-time scheduling approximation,
   considering the local phase situation. The related control law is
   designed considering a fuzzy logic approximation for nonlinear time
   delays coupling. The main advantage is the integration of this behavior
   through extended state space representation. This keeps certain linear
   and bounded behavior leading to a stable situation during an events
   presentation, based on an accurate data transmission rate. An expected
   result is that the basics of the local phase missing as a result of the
   local bounded time delays from the lack of tide synchronization conforms
   to the modeling approximation.},

Title = {Molecular and iridescent feather reflectance data reveal recent genetic
   diversification and phenotypic differentiation in a cloud forest
   hummingbird},

Abstract = {The present day distribution and spatial genetic diversity of
   Mesoamerican biota reflects a long history of responses to habitat
   change. The hummingbird Lampornis amethystinus is distributed in
   northern Mesoamerica, with geographically disjunct populations. Based on
   sampling across the species range using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   sequences and nuclear microsatellites jointly analysed with phenotypic
   and climatic data, we (1) test whether the fragmented distribution is
   correlated with main evolutionary lineages, (2) assess body size and
   plumage color differentiation of populations in geographic isolation,
   and (3) evaluate a set of divergence scenarios and demographic patterns
   of the hummingbird populations. Analysis of genetic variation revealed
   four main groups: blue-throated populations (Sierra Madre del Sur); two
   groups of amethyst-throated populations (Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and
   Sierra Madre Oriental); and populations east of the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec (IT) with males showing an amethyst throat. The most basal
   split is estimated to have originated in the Pleistocene,
   2.39-0.57million years ago (MYA), and corresponded to groups of
   populations separated by the IT. However, the estimated recent
   divergence time between blue- and amethyst-throated populations does not
   correspond to the 2-MY needed to be in isolation for substantial plumage
   divergence, likely because structurally iridescent colors are more
   malleable than others. Results of species distribution modeling and
   Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis fit a model of lineage
   divergence west of the Isthmus after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and
   that the species' suitable habitat was disjunct during past and current
   conditions. These results challenge the generality of the
   contraction/expansion glacial model to cloud forest-interior species and
   urges management of cloud forest, a highly vulnerable ecosystem to
   climate change and currently facing destruction, to prevent further loss
   of genetic diversity or extinction.},

   posterior calyx lobe and a laterally flattened style. However, the
   morphology of the inflorescence of the new species differs from all the
   previously described taxa in the section; although the vegetative
   morphology resembles that of Salvia laevis. The new species is
   distinguished by the dense inflorescence, the peduncle longer than the
   rachis and broadly ovate, persistent bracts, with decussate phyllotaxy
   and two flowers per node. A key is provided to distinguish it from the
   species of the section found in Oaxaca.},

Title = {Superconductivity in Bismuth. A New Look at an Old Problem},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {To investigate the relationship between atomic topology, vibrational and
   electronic properties and superconductivity of bismuth, a 216-atom
   amorphous structure (a-Bi216) was computer-generated using our
   undermelt-quench approach. Its pair distribution function compares well
   with experiment. The calculated electronic and vibrational densities of
   states (eDOS and vDOS, respectively) show that the amorphous eDOS is
   about 4 times the crystalline at the Fermi energy, whereas for the vDOS
   the energy range of the amorphous is roughly the same as the crystalline
   but the shapes are quite different. A simple BCS estimate of the
   possible crystalline superconducting transition temperature gives an
   upper limit of 1.3 mK. The e-ph coupling is more preponderant in a-Bi
   than in crystalline bismuth (x-Bi) as indicated by the lambda obtained
   via McMillan's formula, lambda(c) = 0.24 and experiment lambda(a) =
   2.46. Therefore with respect to x-Bi, superconductivity in a-Bi is
   enhanced by the higher values of. and of eDOS at the Fermi energy.},

Title = {Using one vs. many, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of species

Abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDM) are currently common currency as
   proxies of species distribution range, and using consensus among
   different algorithms is becoming the latest tendency. This information
   is frequently used to estimate conservation status or for conservation
   planning. Nonetheless, different algorithms have huge variation in the
   outcomes. Usually experts determine whether or not a model is accurate,
   often followed by a trimming process. However, this accuracy estimation
   cannot be reproduced. Using Mexican endemic amphibians we evaluate the
   performance of nine modelling algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks,
   Classification Tree Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis,
   Generalised Boosting Model, Generalised Linear Models, Multiple Adaptive
   Regression Splines, MaxEnt, RandomForest, Surface Range Envelope), their
   strict geographic consensus, locality records and simple convex-hull
   areas through comparison of: (1) their presence/absence within Mexico's
   governmental protected areas, (2) range sizes projected, and (3)
   differences in estimated richness by all methods. We conducted all good
   practices prior modelling but removed the trimming factor after
   modelling to make the process repeatable. Presence-absence threshold was
   determined through the use of the receiver-operating characteristic
   (ROC). Presence within conservation network of strict consensus and
   locality records was similar which indicates an over-fitting of the
   former, the rest of the algorithms performed similarly, with exception
   of Surface Range Envelope. Richness patterns varied greatly among
   algorithms. Distribution borders were the areas with higher sensitivity.
   MaxEnt obtained the highest performance in omission but consensus
   performed best in correctly predicting species ranges. Closer
   interaction between curators and modelers would increase SDMs accuracy,
   which would improve conservation planning effectiveness. (C) 2015

   structures and chiroptical properties of thiolated Au-18 cluster doped
   with up to ten Ag atoms, which have been calculated by Time Dependent
   Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT). The number of Ag atoms was steadily
   varied and more stable isomers showed optical and Circular Dichroism(CD)
   spectra distinct from that found for the parent Au-18 cluster. Doping
   with more than four Ag atoms results in enhancement of the oscillator
   strength of the HOMO-LUMO peak and it is expected that this feature can

Title = {Effects of temperature on embryo development and metabolism of O.
   maya},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},

Abstract = {Octopus maya is one of the most promising candidates for octopus
   aquaculture due to its holobenthic development. The objectives of this
   study were to investigate: i) whether the time required for embryonic
   development of this species can be reduced; ii) whether high or low
   temperatures affect the size and physiological characteristics of
   embryos; iii) whether temperature affects the time taken to reach stage
   XX, using thermal time; and iv) the effects of incubation temperature on
   hatchling performance, measured as survival after 10 d fasting. Eggs
   were acclimated at 18, 22, 26 and 30 degrees C. Embryos incubated at 30
   degrees C reached stage XX 50 d before embryos incubated at 18 degrees
   C. A mean value of 596 degrees day(-1) was obtained for embryos
   incubated at 22 and 26 degrees C where embryo development was optimum.
   Principal component analysis showed that arm length was the
   morphological characteristic that separated embryos incubated at 22
   degrees C from the rest of the treatments. Embryos in stage XIX and
   incubated at 26 degrees C had a higher metabolic rate than embryos
   maintained at other experimental temperatures. The best hatchling
   performance was obtained with embryos incubated at 22 degrees C. Results
   indicated that the optimal temperature for O. maya incubation is in the
   range of 22-26 degrees C.
   Statement of relevance: Octopus maya is one of the most promising
   species for octopus aquaculture due its holobenthic development. This
   study will be useful when design production facilities because it gives
   key information to obtain the hatchlings with the best performance. (C)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The bound-state energy spectrum and its evolution for a hydrogen atom
   located along the axis of a standard cylindrical confining cavity with
   either impenetrable or penetrable confining boundaries are obtained by
   solving the stationary Schrodinger equation using a finite differences
   approach. New results are first presented for a nuclear-centered
   position for the penetrable case as the barrier height and cavity size
   change. Special attention is then given to the energy-level dependence
   on the nuclear position along the cylinder axis, where proper
   identification for the evolution of states from the nuclear-centered
   position (centered states) up to the cylinder cap (cap states) is
   proposed, while the corresponding state evolution for intermediate
   nuclear positions (intermediate states) remains consistent with node
   conservation and symmetry. It is found that in general the energy levels
   evolve with an increasing value as the nuclear position is shifted from
   the central position up to a cylinder cap. As the barrier height (and
   cavity size) are reduced, a progressive extinction of bound states
   appears in the order cap states, intermediate states and centered
   states. Finally, a predominance of cavity-size over barrier-height
   effects on the energy level shift is found.},

Abstract = {Aside from the admixture between indigenous people and people from
   overseas, populations in Mexico changed drastically after the Spanish
   conquest of the sixteenth century, forming an intricate history that has
   been underutilized in understanding the genetic population structure of
   Mexicans. To infer historical processes of isolation, dispersal, and
   assimilation, we examined the phylogeography of mitochondrial (mt) DNA
   and Y-chromosome lineages in 3,026 individuals from 10 urban and nine
   indigenous populations by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms. A
   geographic array with a predominance of Amerindian lineages was observed
   for mtDNA, with northern indigenous populations being divergent from the
   central and southern indigenous populations; urban populations showed
   low differentiation with isolation by distance. Y-chromosome variation
   distinguished urban and indigenous populations through the Amerindian
   haplogroup Q frequency. The MtDNA and the Y-chromosome together
   primarily distinguished urban and indigenous populations, with different
   geographic arrays for both. Gene flow across geographical distance and
   between the urban and indigenous realms appears to have altered the
   pre-Hispanic phylogeography in central and southern Mexico, mainly by
   displacement of women, while maintaining the indigenous isolation in the
   north, southeast, and Zapotec regions. Most Amerindian mtDNA diversity
   currently occurs in urban populations and appears to be reduced among
   indigenous people.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   The inflorescences of Tilia americana var. mexicana are used as an
   infusion in Mexican traditional medicine due to their tranquilizing
   effects; however, pharmacological and phytochemical studies of the
   leaves are lacking.
   Objective
   In this research, the anxiolytic and sedative-like efficacy of the Tilia
   americana var. mexicana leaves was compared to that obtained with its
   inflorescences and flavonoids therein identified, as well as the
   possible mechanism of action.
   Methods
   The sorted and dried infloresdences and leaves were macerated
   subsequently in hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. The. methanol
   extracts were qualitative- and quantitative-analyzed by HPLC, using
   commercial flavonoids standards selected on the basis of their
   previously reported presence in Tilia species. The pharmacological
   activity was evaluated in CD-1 mice in the tests: open-field, elevated
   plus-maze, hole-beard, and the sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep
   potentiation test. In regard to the mechanism of action, participation
   of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors was tested with the
   respective antagonists: flumazenil and WAY100635.
   Results
   The presence of quercetin, rutin and isoquercitrin was confirmed in the
   extracts of the inflorescences and leaves. The anxiolytic-like effects
   were the same-between the two organs, which were inhibited in the
   presence of flumazenil and WAY100635.
   Discussion and conclusion
   Our results provide evidence that the-extracts of the leaves of T
   americana var mexicana are as efficacious as the inflorescences to pip
   duce anxiolytic and sedative-like effects, where flavonoids-like
   quercetin, rutin and isoquercitrin are partially resporisible for these
   activities by the involvement of GABA/BDZ and 5HT(IA) serotonergic
   receptors.},

Abstract = {This study presents the first bathymetric surveys and descriptions of
   the morphometric parameters of the major lakes of the national park and
   Ramsar Convention site Lagunas de Montebello, Chiapas, Mexico and
   represents the first contribution on these limnologically unknown lakes.
   The morphology of lacustrine basins has an important influence on the
   physical, chemical and biological dynamics, and limnological research
   must consider the bathymetry and the related morphometric parameters of
   the lakes. Of the more than 50 lakes that make up this karst lake system
   (including dolines, uvalas and poljes), 18 representative lakes were
   selected along a NW-SE transect. The lakes have widely varying
   dimensions and include small and deep, small and shallow, large and
   deep, and large and shallow lakes. The shapes of the lakes vary from
   circular to elliptical, and the basin resembles an inverted truncated
   cone. The orientation of the main axis follows the structural
   orientations of the karst landscape (i.e., faults, fractures and folds).
   The maximum lengths range from 0.14 to 3.2 km, the surface areas range
   from 1.1 ha to 306.6 ha, and the lake volumes range from 0.00004 to
   0.08852 km(3). Six lakes are among the deepest lakes in Mexico and have
   an average maximum depth of more than 50 m; the deepest lake has a
   maximum depth of 198 m. These depths favor prolonged stratification,
   which increases the probability of accumulating pollutants.},

Abstract = {In this work microPET scans and Monte Carlo simulations of line sources
   containing F-18, N-13 and Ga-68 were performed to study the effect that
   positron range has over the spatial resolution of PET images. The
   experimental studies were carried out using a microPET Focus 120 scanner
   with a reported axial spatial resolution of 1.44 mm. Line sources
   consisted of thin capillary tubes filled with a water solution
   containing a known activity concentration of the radionuclides and
   placed inside six different tissue equivalent cylindrical phantoms.
   Image reconstruction was performed using filtered backprojection and
   from the axial images, radial profiles were extracted to compute the
   spatial resolution for all radionuclide-material combinations. One
   dimensional line sources inside cylinders were simulated using PENELOPE
   to obtain the line spread functions (LSFs) of all the
   radionuclide-material combinations. Our results indicate that spatial
   resolution depends strongly on the radionuclide (positron energy) and
   the density of the tissue in which they travel before annihilation.},

   and new records in Mexico},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {93-99},
Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Apocynaceae are one of the most species
   diverse groups of Mexico with numerous contributions to understand its
   systematics and distribution. However, some taxa are little known, as in
   the case of Odontadenia macrantha. A description, new distribution
   records, and conservation status of O. macrantha in Mexico are
   presented.
   Methods: Based on detailed observation of specimens from different
   herbaria and taxonomic literature, a description of the taxon and a key
   to morphologically and geographically close species is presented. In
   addition, an assessment of the conservation status of the species in
   Mexico, based on the IUCN criteria, and a distribution map are provided.
   Key results: The presence of this species in Tabasco and Veracruz
   extends its distribution further northwards. Additionally, these records
   provided new types of vegetation in which the species grows, such as
   tropical rain forest, tropical forest with Curatella, tropical deciduous
   forest and Quercus forest. Odontadenia macrantha is a taxon of variable
   morphology, which is corroborated here, because it has smaller corollas
   than the individuals of southern populations. Here is suggested to place
   this species in the category of Endangered (EN C2ai) for being
   restricted to a small tropical area with a high anthropogenic activity
   and few individuals in the observed populations.
   Conclusions: These new records suggest that the constant review of
   biological collections to maintain knowledge on taxa updated is needed.
   In addition, collection activities should be continued in the vegetation
   remnants of Tabasco and Veracruz.},

Abstract = {The human body is resilient but becomes frail when cardiac function is
   impaired, that is with sickness and age. Recently, it has been proposed
   to quantify frailty or resilience by a statistical study of time series
   {[}1]. One of the most studied physiological variables is heart rate
   variability (HRV), that has been associated to physiological frailty
   {[}2]. In this work, we carried out short cardiovascular monitoring (5
   minutes) and studied the ANS response in the face of different
   stressors. Usually, HRV has been measured in rest conditions, in this
   way, spontaneous fluctuations are analized. For this contribution, we
   based on Ewing test and imposed two different kind of stressors:
   rhythmic breathing and standing upright. Several measures of HRV were
   analized. It was found that including stressors in this kind of
   measurements yields more information about adaptation to different
   environment (internal or external), also allowed to better distinguish
   different age groups (despite the fact that population was small). We
   found that heart rate response to standing and the modulation capacity
   decreases with age.},

   for and tested in this study, entailed: selecting basic evolutionary
   knowledge from the model of evolution through variation and natural
   selection; designing a coordinated set of activities, teaching resources
   and evaluation tools; leading a process of teacher training; and
   building bridges between: the teaching model, research into the teaching
   of evolutionary biology, our own teaching experience and that of the
   secondary school teacher who participated in the project. The data
   collected through questionnaires show significant differences in favour
   of the experimental group, which means that the proposal may be
   favourably assessed in the context of Mexican education, in terms of
   feasibility, relevance and the pedagogical transformation of knowledge.},

Abstract = {The /tomentella-thelephora lineage is one of the most highly dominant
   clades among ectomycorrhizal communities worldwide. Despite its
   importance as a root symbiont, its fruit bodies are inconspicuous and
   rarely found. Knowledge regarding the diversity of Tomentella in the
   Neotropics is scarce, and is based largely on environmental samples.
   Here, we describe a new species, Tomentella brunneoincrustata, including
   its basidiocarp morphology, mycorrhizal anatomy, and ecology. Because
   knowledge of Tomentella in Mexico is scarce, we provide the first
   phylogenetic analysis of this genus in the country. We sequenced the
   nrITS region of the fungal samples, and sequenced the rbcL and trnL
   regions to identify the host plant. The phylogenetic analyses were
   conducted by Bayesian inference. The Bayesian analysis showed that
   several paraphyletic clades within the lineage /tomentellathelephora are
   associated with Pisonieae present across tropical regions of the world.
   However, the ectomycorrhizae sequences from Puerto Rico, Florida,
   Dominica, and Mexico constituted a well-supported monophyletic clade
   that we denote as the ``Pisonieae-associated Neotropical Tomentella
   clade{''}. Within this clade, T. brunneoincrustata was characterized as
   follows: a thin crustose, strongly attached to the substrate basidiome;
   concolorous subiculum, undifferentiated and sterile margin; two types of
   subiculum hyphae; and small (<8 mu m) globose to ellipsoid spores. This
   species develops in tropical dry forests, where it associates with hosts
   in the Pisonieae tribe within the Nyctaginaceae. The remaining
   Tomentella fruit body vouchers collected in temperate forests of Mexico
   belonged to clades related to T. atramentaria, T. pilosa, T. muricata,
   T. fuscocinerea, T. stuposa, T. punicea, T. atroarenicolor, T.
   bryophila, and T. lateritia. Five fruit body vouchers had unique
   sequences forming independent and unknown clades of Tomentella.},

Abstract = {The cardiac restitution curve describes functional relationships between
   diastolic intervals and their corresponding action potential durations.
   Although the simplest relationship is that restitution curves are
   monotonic, empirical studies have suggested that cardiac patients
   present a more complex dynamical process characterized, for instance, by
   a non-monotonic restitution curve. The purpose of this chapter is to
   analyze the dynamical properties of a non-monotonic cardiac restitution
   curve model derived from previously published clinical data. To achieve
   this goal, we use Recurrence Quantitative Analysis combined with
   Lyapunov exponents and Supertrack Functions in order to describe the
   complex dynamics underlying non-monotonic restitution curves. We
   conclude by highlighting that a consequence of the advanced complex
   dynamics that emerges from the aforementioned non-monotonicity, is the
   increasing risk of alternant rhythms.},

Abstract = {Conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems that are significantly
   influenced by urban activities requires the classification and
   establishment of potential reference sites. However, in Latin American
   countries, policies are not available that outlines the identification
   and evaluation of such sites. Therefore, this study represents a
   proposal for evaluating the ecological quality of peri-urban rivers in
   the conservation soil (CS) areas/zones of Mexico City. The proposal
   accounts for the zone's physicochemical, hydromorphological, and
   bacteriological characteristics along with its macroinvertebrate
   richness. Our evaluation was performed using a canonical correspondence
   analysis (CCA) and indicator values (IndVal) calculated for different
   taxa. River headwaters serve/work as a good physicochemical point for
   potential references sites. However, the hydromorphology of the CS has
   been gradually modified by numerous hydraulic alterations within the
   peri-urban zone. Using the CCA and IndVal, two types of sites were
   confirmed: sites in a good state of conservation and quality and sites
   modified by human activity, featuring lower discharge flow, poor quality
   hydromorphological values and Oligochaeta class organisms. At the sites
   featuring a good state of conservation and quality, higher
   hydromorphological values were positively correlated with discharge flow
   and certain macroinvertebrate taxa, including Nemouridae, Podonominae,
   Tanypodinae, Acarina, Baetis, Tipula, Antocha, Atopsyche, Glossosoma,
   Polycentropus, Hesperophylax and Limnephilus. In the sites modified by
   human activity, the genus Simulium was classified as a
   disturbance-tolerant organism. The river reach within the urban zone is
   basically an open-air drainage ditch. Evaluations of the ecological
   quality of the riparian zone were used to identify the most important
   hydromorphological qualities and discharge flow parameters and to select
   the most appropriate factors that should be monitored in peri-urban
   rivers of the Mexico Basin.},

   state of Hidalgo. The site with difficult accessibility (S1) had a
   larger total number of individuals, with larger dimensions, and more
   juveniles. The site with easy accessibility (S2) had a predominance of
   adults. A total of 456 individuals were counted and only one sapling was
   found. We estimated a population density of 1410 individuals/ha in S1
   and 863 individuals/ha in S2. We determined the type of population as
   regressive, because in both sites we found a significantly larger number
   of individuals in the stage of maturity and a low number of juveniles
   (12.9\%), which suggests a future population decline.},

   This paper introduces a strategy, based on the Max-flow min-cut theorem,
   to agglomerate and allocate parallel processes onto a distributed
   computing architecture. The main goal of the strategy is to decrease the
   amount of remote communications and increase the amount of local
   communications. The strategy allocates the processes ``carefully{''}
   over the distributed nodes, and that causes the communication time of
   the parallel system to be minimized.},

Abstract = {Lovelock theory of gravity -and, in particular, Einstein theory-admits
   black hole solutions that can be equipped with a hair by conformally
   coupling the theory to a real scalar field. This is a secondary hair,
   meaning that it does not endow the black hole with new quantum numbers.
   It rather consists of a non-trivial scalar field profile of fixed
   intensity which turns out to be regular everywhere outside and on the
   horizon and, provided the cosmological constant is negative, behaves at
   large distance in a way compatible with the Anti-de Sitter (AdS)
   asymptotic. In this paper, we review the main features of these hairy
   black hole solutions, such as their geometrical and thermodynamical
   properties. The conformal coupling to matter in dimension D > 4 in
   principle includes higher-curvature terms. These couplings are obtained
   from the Lovelock action through the Stueckelberg strategy. As a
   consequence, the resulting scalar-tensor theory exhibits a self-duality
   under field redefinition that resembles T-duality. Through this field
   redefinition, the matter content of the theory transforms into a
   Lovelock action for a dual geometry. Since the hairy black holes only
   exist for special relations between the dual Lovelock coupling
   constants, it is natural to compare those relations with the causality
   bounds coming from AdS/CFT. We observe that, while the lower causality
   bound is always obeyed, the upper causality bound is violated. The

Journal = {SOFT MATTER},

Pages = {1295-1312},
Abstract = {Three discotic liquid-crystalline binary mixtures, characterized by
   their extent of bidispersity in molecular thickness, were investigated
   with molecular dynamics simulations. Each equimolar mixture contained
   A-type (thin) and B-type (thick) discogens. The temperature-dependence
   of the orientational order parameter reveals that A-type liquid samples
   produce ordered phases more readily, with the (hexagonal) columnar phase
   being the most structured variant. Moderately and strongly bidisperse
   mixtures produce globally-segregated samples for temperatures
   corresponding to ordered phases; the weakly bidisperse mixture displays
   microheterogeneities. Ordered phases in the B-type liquid are induced
   partially by the presence of the A-type fluid. In the moderately
   bidisperse mixture, order is induced through orientational frustration:
   a mixed prenematic-like phase precedes global segregation to yield
   nematic and columnar mesophases upon further cooling. In the strongly
   bidisperse mixture, order is induced less efficiently through a
   paranematic-like mechanism: a highly-ordered A-type fluid imparts order
   to B-type discogens found at the interface of a fully-segregated sample.
   This ordering effect permeates into the disordered B-type domain until
   nematic and columnar phases emerge upon further cooling. At sufficiently
   low temperatures, all samples investigated exhibit the (hexagonal)
   columnar mesophase.},

Abstract = {The traditional management units (TMU) went through a participative
   analysis in the Protected Natural Area, Corredor Biologico
   Chichinautzin, Morelos, incorporating the forms of appropriation in
   ethnobotanical variables on conservation in order to generate a value
   index of cultural importance (VICI) and thus elaborate proposals for
   citizens. Two organizational forms were found: the traditional
   organization which encourages independence before external
   sociopolitical interests, and the community organization which
   corresponds to the legal bureaucratic authority that regulates foreign
   trade. The analyzed TMUs were: agriculture, livestock, forests, lowland
   deciduous forests (LDF) and traditional fruit orchards (TFO). According
   to the VICI, Pinus montezumae prevail in the forests with 120 \%,
   Erythrina americana Zompantle prevail in the LDF with 105 \%, and Prunus
   persica peach tree prevail in the TFO with 67 \%. According to
   informant, 75, 63 and 55 \% of the species present a high availability
   in the forests, LDF, and TFO, respectively. The diagnosis helped connect
   the ethnobotanical variables of the conservation state and the
   appropriation limitations with participatory proposals, such as: the
   establishment of plots of land to validate the cornfields, the
   implementation of drylots for livestock, and the promotion of training
   programs to recuperate the transmission and provision of feedback of
   local knowledge of the TMU.},

Abstract = {In this work, a technique to produce spatial electromagnetic modes with
   definite orbital angular momentum is presented. The method is based in
   the construction of binary diffractive gratings generated by computer.
   In the classical regime the gratings produce the well known
   Laguerre-Gaussian modes distributions when illuminated by a plane wave.
   In the quantum regime the grating is placed in the signal path of a
   spontaneous parametric down conversion layout and the diffraction
   pattern, observed in the coincidence count rate, shows that the single
   photons are projected onto spatial states consistent with a
   Laguerre-Gaussian modes distribution.},

Title = {Extraction and embryo morphology of Bursera bipinnata
   (Burseraceae)},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {27-35},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The understanding of the reproductive biology of
   plants, from the formation of the seed to its establishment, allows the
   development of different conservation strategies. In the genus Bursera,
   whose main center of diversification is Mexico, the diaspore is a pyrene
   formed by a strongly lignified endocarp enclosing the seed. The
   anatomical characteristics of the pyrene and the parthenocarpy are the
   main factors that have hindered the study of embryogenesis and the
   development of propagation techniques. In this paper we describe the
   morphology of the Bursera bipinnata embryo, extracted by a technique
   that does not alter the structure or the chemical composition of
   tissues.
   Methods: During the beginning of the dispersal stage 2014, we collected
   unripe fruits and pyrenes with exposed pseudaril. Unripe fruits were
   fixed in FAA. A low speed micromotor with handpiece was used. A conical
   burr was used in unripe fruits to scabble the fruit valves. To open the
   pyrenes a diamond disc was used. After opening the endocarp, embryos
   were removed and fixed.
   Key results: The pattern of development coincides with other model
   species of angiosperms. In immature fruits globular, heart-shaped,
   torpedo and cotyledonary stages were observed, the latter in early
   stages. During the torpedo stage, cotyledons branch into three lobes and
   are spliced, as they grow, they are folded upon themselves, and cover
   the embryonic axis; however, the radicular meristem is always exposed.
   Conclusions: The extraction technique is rapid, inexpensive and
   non-destructive to tissues, having a potential use in the detailed
   analysis of embryogenesis in the genus Bursera, tissue culture and ex
   situ conservation.},

   Socioeconomic factors influencing the motivation to be engaged in the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Two of the main motives for people to be engaged in the Mexican Payment
   for Environmental Services (PES) programme are forest conservation and
   the income received from the programme. We explore the socioeconomic
   conditions that support choosing these motives. We used data from a 2012
   nationwide survey, processed through logit models. Significant factors
   influencing the desire to conserve as a motive were family welfare
   improvement, land use change intention, and training. Those affecting
   income as a motive were formal education, indigenous people
   participation and training. Finally, factors related to both
   conservation and income, as a motive, were formal education, training,
   PES influence in water management, and land boundary conflicts. Income
   and conservation are not mutually exclusive motives for engagement in
   the programme, given that in developing countries income from PES may
   reduce the socioeconomic pressures triggering land use change, and has a
   role in conservation efforts, already present in many rural communities.

Title = {On the mechanism of electrical conductivity in
   Ce1/3NbO3},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {101-106},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Using electrical conductivity measurements, we found the existence of
   different activation energy values for the electric transport in
   Ce1/3NbO3: 0.78 eV for T > 800 degrees C and 0.39 eV for T < 800 degrees
   C. Atomistic simulations have shown that the energy required to move the
   Ce3+ ions is around 8 eV, which is one order of magnitude higher of what
   is experimentally found. Additionally, electrical measurements at
   different partial pressures of oxygen show that the material has
   oxygen-ion conductivity, but the activation energy of 0.39 eV suggests
   other possible mechanisms of electrical conductivity. One of these
   possibilities is electronic transport, where the activation energy could
   be due to the band gap. To determine whether electronic conductivity is
   contributing in the low temperature regime, we performed ab-initio DFT
   electronic calculations to evaluate the gap, using the modified
   Becke-Johnson potential. Due to a Ce: 4f level found in the gap, which
   obstructed the convergence of the calculation, we used the LDA + U
   approach on the Ce atoms, this moves the 4f levels out of the gap. We
   used the values U = 1, 2 and 3 eV, then extrapolated back to U = 0 to
   find the location of the Ce: 4f state in the gap. The computed value of
   the activation energy for electronic conductivity is higher than the
   experimental one, and resembles more the optical gap value found in
   Ce1/3NbO3. Based on this result, it can be inferred that the electrical
   conductivity in Ce1/3NbO3 proceeds via anionic charge carriers in the
   entire temperature studied range. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Effect of dissolved carbon dioxide on oxygen consumption in the Pacific

Volume = {49},

Pages = {337-346},
Abstract = {A failure in the aeration system of Litopenaeus vannamei rearing with
   biofloc technology can decrease the oxygen concentrations rapidly and
   also increase the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations at the same rate.
   We report here an evaluation of the effect of CO2 on the oxygen
   consumption of L. vannamei. We used a continuous-flow respirometer with
   water recirculation equipped with a digital fiber-optic oximeter. Eight
   juveniles of L. vannamei (12.1 +/- 1. 4 g) were used in each treatment
   with one per respiratory chamber (0.6 L). The shrimp were exposed to six
   concentrations of CO2 (5, 30, 60, 95, 150, and 300 mgCO(2)/L) with an
   acute exposure time of six hours. Upon treatment with 5-30 mgCO(2)/L, we
   observed a consumption of oxygen of 0.233 +/- 0.129 and 0.33 +/- 0.072
   mgO(2)/g/h, respectively. Upon treatment with 60 mgCO(2)/L, an increase
   was observed in the oxygen consumption (0.521 +/- 0.098 mgO(2)/g/h).
   Upon treatment with 95, 150, and 300 mgCO(2)/L however, the shrimp
   decreased their oxygen consumption and lost their equilibrium. The CO2
   should therefore be maintained at a maximum of 5 mgCO(2)/L during shrimp
   rearing.},

Title = {Evaluation of three balanced feeds for fattening juvenile spotted rose

Journal = {HIDROBIOLOGICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of three
   commercially-available feeds (currently used for shrimp, mackerel, and
   sea bass) on young spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus. One hundred
   and twenty wild juveniles were captured along the coast of Nayarit near
   Sayulita beach. The specific growth rate (SGR\% g/day) and Food
   Conversion Factor (FCF) were evaluated over 60 days. One hundred and
   twenty wild juveniles in four 150 L tanks per treatment with 10 fish per
   tank were used. The initial length and wet weight for animals fed with
   food for shrimp, mackerel, or sea bass were 16.7 +/- 0.68, 16.8 +/-
   1.14, and 16.4 +/- 1.19 cm, respectively, and initial wet weight 119.1
   +/- 18.56, 115.5 +/- 21.29, and 87.4 +/- 21 g/animal, respectively. SGR
   and FCF changed throughout the experiments, with higher values in SGR in
   animals fed the sea bass feed (1.02\% g/day; and lower of FCF (1.4:1)).
   Lower values of SGR were observed in fish fed with shrimp food, 0.45\%
   g/day, although they had a higher FCF value (2.5:1). An intermediate SGR
   value was recorded in animals fed the mackerel feed (0.5\% g/day), with
   higher FCF (4.43:1). All the experimental conditions were similar for
   all the treatments, suggesting that fish were only affected by the type
   of feed used. Consequently, we conclude that the feed currently used for
   sea bass can be recommended as feed for L. guttatus, at least when
   animals are maintained under conditions similar to those present in this
   study.},

Title = {Potassium enhances frost tolerance in young individuals of three

Journal = {FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Pages = {461-467},
Abstract = {Movement of species outside their range of distribution could be a
   strategy for conservation purposes, but before implementation, it is
   necessary to evaluate plants responses to the conditions that they will
   experience in new locations. We evaluated the effect of potassium
   fertilisation to enhance the frost tolerance of young individuals of
   Albizia plurijuga (Standley) Britton \& Rose, Cedrela dugesii S. Watson
   and Ceiba aesculifolia (Kunth) Britten \& Baker f., which are all common
   species from tropical dry forests in Mexico. Plants were propagated in a
   shade-house and fertilised during 9 months with different concentrations
   of potassium (39, 189 and 528 ppm). In frost simulations, plants were
   exposed to temperatures below 0 degrees C during different time periods
   and frost injury was assessed by electrolyte leakage of leaf discs from
   young and old leaves. We observed that potassium fertilisation enhanced
   frost tolerance by reducing electrolyte leakage mainly in young leaves.
   We recorded plant re-sprouting ability after exposure to subzero
   temperatures over 45 days, finding notable differences among species:
   all individuals of C. dugesii sprouted, followed by some of A. plurijuga
   and finally just one of C. aesculifolia. Also, high potassium levels
   increased re-sprouting response. These species have a low frost
   tolerance, but potassium fertilisation seemed to be effective to enhance
   it for young individuals, increasing the probability of survival if
   plants are moved to colder areas than current habitats.},

Title = {Use of herbarium data to evaluate weediness in five congeners},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {It is often desirable to quantify a plant's relative weediness or
   synanthropy, that is, the degree to which a species associates with
   human-caused disturbance, in order to study and understand the biology,
   ecology and evolution of weeds and invasive plants. Herbarium specimens
   are among the most accessible and verifiable sources of data on
   distribution and habitat. However, the habitat distribution of species
   may not be reflected accurately by herbarium specimen data, due
   towell-known biases in plant collection. Here, we assess how well
   herbarium specimens reflect species' weediness, when compared with
   direct field surveys. We used five species of Melampodium (Asteraceae)
   and classified their degree of weediness with a modification of
   Nuorteva's synanthropy index, based on herbarium specimens. We then
   modelled the distribution of our focal species in Mexico using MaxEnt
   and identified a polygon of similar to 3000 km(2) in the state of
   Nayarit, Mexico, where there was a high probability of finding all five
   species. Systematic field searches in the target area documented all
   visible populations of four species along major and minor roads. Then
   we, again, classified their degree of weediness with the synanthropy
   index, based now on field data, and compared. We found that herbarium
   data were an accurate predictor of a species' weediness relative to its
   congeners despite the well-documented skew of herbarium data towards
   natural areas, which our data reflected as well. So, herbarium data can
   be used to classify species' weediness relative to each other, but not
   in absolute terms, if the specimens were correctly identified and none
   of the species were subject to particular collection bias. This study is
   the first attempt to compare herbarium and field data on this subject
   and may be relevant for other types of investigations based on herbarium
   data. Our work also highlights the usefulness of distribution models
   based on herbarium specimens.},

Journal = {HIDROBIOLOGICA},

Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {311-321},
Abstract = {Background. Microbial consortia have ecological and biotechnological
   importance since they contribute to the biogeochemical cycles in nature
   and produce compounds of high economical value. Goals. Research for this
   paper involved the polyphasic study of a photosynthetic microbial
   consortium (MC) in order to identify the microorganisms that comprise
   it, in addition to exploring the theory of the biotechnological
   potential of each partner within the consortium. Methods. Study of
   morphological and phylogenetic diversity. Results. Twenty-one different
   microorganisms were identified that make up the MC belonging to the
   phyla Proteobacteria (Rhodobacter sp., Devosia insulae, Pedomicrobium
   americanum, Alpha proteobacteria, Aquaspirillum delicatum, Methylibium
   petroleiphilum and Nannocystis sp.), Bacteriodetes (Flavobacterium sp.
   and Flavobacterium aquatile), Cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon
   aphanizomenoides, Leptolyngbya sp. and Anabaena oscillarioides),
   Chlorophyta (Monoraphidium sp. and Chlorella sp.), Heterokontophyta
   (Cyclotella meneghiniana, Melosira varians, Cocconeis placentula,
   Achnanthidium chlidanos, Navicula radiosa, Fragilaria ulna and Nitzschia
   sp.). This microbial consortium was shown to have a high capacity for
   nitrogen fixation (10,294 nmol ethylene g(-1) dry weight h(-1)).
   Conclusions. The identification of microorganisms that form the MC and
   their capacity for growth and nitrogen fixation in a photobioreactor,
   give us a glimpse of their possible biotechnological application as a
   biofertilizer.},

Abstract = {Among the social concerns of first order is the subject of the age
   groups of 60 years or more; i.e. demographically have been fortunate to
   reach old age. Of Mexico, the State of Mexico is the most populous state
   with a population of 60 years or more than the figure of 1.2 million
   people. The amount itself draws attention, therefore, is to analyze how
   is your life and what are exposed individuals in their daily lives, how
   it is exposure to risk and what their margin of ability to overcome
   them, because the risks, dependence and limited capacity to face places
   them in situations of personal and social vulnerability. In this
   scenario, the objective of this article is to identify the degree of
   social vulnerability faced by the elderly population in the State of
   Mexico at the municipal level. To achieve this, an index of estimated of
   social vulnerability of the aging population in the State of Mexico
   municipalities through the principal components method was estimated.
   The data come from the Census of Population and Housing 2010. The
   results suggest that older adults face heterogeneous situations of
   social vulnerability that impact differentially living conditions of the
   elderly in the municipalities of the State of Mexico.},

Title = {Effect of maternal temperature stress before spawning over the energetic
   balance of Octopus maya juveniles exposed to a gradual
   temperature change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {474},

Abstract = {Octopus maya supports an important fishery in Yucatan Peninsula (YP)
   where this species is highly abundant. Considering that temperatures in
   the tropics are increasing (IPCC, 2013), there are several scenarios
   that can modify the dynamic of the O. maya population in YP: i)
   prolonged summer and short winter seasons, and/or ii) fast temperature
   increases and high temperatures after a winter season, both affecting
   the survival of hatchlings and the performance of juveniles. The present
   study was designed to evaluate the effect of maternal temperature stress
   over hatchling and juvenile performance in terms of their energetic
   plasticity and thermoregulatory behaviour, when they were exposed to a
   gradual temperature increase (TI) from 24 to 30 degrees C and compared
   with hatchlings maintained at preferred and constant temperature (24
   degrees C). Hatchlings from stressed females were smaller, and had a
   lower growth rate compared to those from unstressed females providing
   evidence that temperature stress experienced by females has consequences
   on the performance of hatchlings, with effects on the biomass production
   and survival. Results also demonstrated that hatchlings exposed to TI
   (24-30 degrees C) had a growth rate and oxygen consumption similar to
   those maintained at preferred temperature (24 degrees C), in both female
   groups indicating that a gradual temperature increase of 1 degrees C
   every 5 days is probably enough to allow the organisms to make
   physiological adjustments without an excessive energetic cost. (C) 2015

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Randia brevituba is a new species of the Paranean region of Argentina
   and Paraguay. It differs from the closest species, R. ferox, which is
   sympatric, in having short corolla tubes of 4.7-5.4 mm in the pistillate
   flowers and 2.8-7.9 mm in the staminate flowers, calyx lobes varying in
   shape and size in the same pistillate flower, and globose fruits 14-17
   mm long (versus corolla tubes of 25.0-27.0 and 22.6-34.0 mm long,
   respectively, calyx lobes equal in shape and size, and fruit 3-5 cm and
   ovoid, ellipsoid or subglobose in R. ferox). We also discuss the
   taxonomic concept and geographic distribution of Randia armata, and
   conclude that it is markedly different from R. brevituba and the other
   species in the Southern Cone studied here, and moreover, that it does
   not occur in the Southern Cone. We provide a taxonomic key to
   distinguish the new species from other species of Randia in the Southern
   Cone of America.},

Title = {Efficient algorithms for general periodic Lorentz gases in two and three
   dimensions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We present efficient algorithms to calculate trajectories for periodic
   Lorentz gases consisting of square lattices of circular obstacles in two
   dimensions, and simple cubic lattices of spheres in three dimensions;
   these become increasingly efficient as the radius of the obstacles tends
   to 0, the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit. The 2D algorithm applies
   continued fractions to obtain the exact disc with which a particle will
   collide at each step, instead of using periodic boundary conditions as
   in the classical algorithm. The 3D version incorporates the 2D algorithm
   by projecting to the three coordinate planes. As an application, we
   calculate distributions of free path lengths close to the Boltzmann-Grad
   limit for certain Lorentz gases. We also show how the algorithms may be
   applied to deal with general crystal lattices.},

Title = {Resurrection of Anolis ustus Cope, 1864 from synonymy with

Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2016},
Number = {619},
Pages = {147-162},
Abstract = {In this study, based on a morphological analysis, the resurrection of
   the name Anolis ustus Cope 1864, is proposed for populations from the
   Yucatan Peninsula (Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo, Mexico, and
   Belize), formerly referred as A. sericeus Hallowell, 1856. Anolis ustus
   differs from A. sericeus by its mean snout-vent length and number of
   gorgetal scales in males, in tibia length and head width in females, and
   dorsal and ventral scales for both sexes. In addition, A. ustus has a
   small dewlap of similar size between males and females, whereas in A.
   sericeus males have a dewlap much larger than that of the females. These
   characteristics allow A. ustus to be identified within the A. sericeus
   complex. In this study, a description of the characteristics of the
   hemipenis is also provided, and its importance in the taxonomy of Anolis
   is discussed.},

Abstract = {Recently technological advances allow monitoring different physiological
   variables non-invasively and continuously over time. Temporary
   fluctuations in variables whose statistical study can be approached as
   time series, allow understanding the underlying dynamics of the organ
   generating such fluctuations. Here we study the variability of brain
   networks based on using electroencephalographic (EEG) records from in
   two groups of people whose extreme ages were 10 (four children) or 70
   year old persons under good physical and mental health, according to a
   set of tests previous to the recordings. The EEG recording protocol used
   was the international 10-20 configuration for nineteen electrodes. The
   time series were filtered to obtain the alpha range (8-13 Hz) from
   non-overlapping time intervals Delta t, each consisting of N data
   points. The spatial correlation matrix C was calculated for each
   interval. Our results show the loss of variability of the functional
   brain network in the 70 year old population when compared with the
   children population. This method may now be extended to analyse
   responses of people of a wider range of ages and under different
   cognitive situations.},

   Mexico, for the purpose of the aquarium trade. Although the species has
   been exploited for more than 40 years, studies have not yet been
   undertaken to understand the population parameters required for adequate
   management of the fishery. The objective of this work was to describe
   for the first time the growth and mortality of this species. The
   information provided in this study contributes to the generation of
   knowledge necessary to establish sustainable management practices.
   Materials and methods. The growth curve of the species was determined by
   applying a modal progression analysis of the sample length frequency
   distribution to determine the number of cohorts present through the
   multinomial statistic based on a probability function. Once the cohorts
   were identified, the von Bertalanffy growth model was adjusted using a
   maximum likelihood function. To estimate the natural mortality rate and
   natural mortality-at-age, empirical methods were used. Were also
   estimated the size and age at first maturity (L-m, t(m)), the maximum
   age (t(max)), the fishing mortality (F), the total mortality (Z), and
   the exploitation rate (E).
   Results. In total, 794 king angelfish were measured and weighed,
   including 659 juveniles and 135 adults. The total length of the fish
   ranged from 3 to 29 cm, and the weight was within 2-797 g. The potential
   weight-length relation was significant (r(2) = 0.94; P > 0.01), showing
   a negative allometric curve with the parameters: a = 0.108 and b =
   2.618. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation were:
   L-infinity = 37.894 cm, k = 0.127 year(-1), t(0) = -0.658 years. The
   natural mortality rate was estimated to be 0.315 year-1. The following
   values were estimated for: L-m = 21.835 cm, t(m) = 6.10 years, t(max) =
   20.01 years, Z = 1.19 year(-1), F = 0.88 year(-1), and E = 0.74.
   Conclusion. Estimates of natural mortality could be linked to management
   measures such as catch quotas.},

Abstract = {Let C = \{c(1),..., c(n)\} be a collection of disjoint closed bounded
   convex sets in the plane. Suppose that one of them, say c(1), represents
   a valuable object we want to uncover, and we are allowed to pick a
   direction alpha is an element of {[}0, 2 pi) along which we can
   translate (remove) the elements of C, one at a time, while avoiding
   collisions. We study the problem of finding a direction alpha(0) such
   that the number of elements that have to be removed along alpha(0)
   before we can remove c(1) is minimized. We prove that if we have the
   sorted set D of directions defined by the tangents between pairs of
   elements of C, we can find alpha(0) in O(n(2)) time. We also discuss the
   problem of sorting D, in o(n(2)logn) time. 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Effects of obesity on circadian photic entrainment of locomotor activity

Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Obesity is increasing in industrialized countries at an alarming rate.
   Recent studies have linked this condition with changes in the circadian
   regulation, and circadian clock dysfunctions have also been linked to
   metabolic disorders. When in captivity and fed a regular rodent chow
   diet ad libitum some volcano mice, Neotomodon alstoni (endemic species
   of Mexico) become overweight and display symptoms equivalent to
   metabolic syndrome. The aim of this work was to observe whether there
   are significant changes in the functional properties of the circadian
   system, namely in the entraining circadian locomotor activity rhythm,
   between mice that became obese and normal adult mice. Freely moving
   circadian rhythms of locomotor activity were tested under constant
   conditions as well as under conditions of discrete and continuous
   entrainment. Our results show that volcano lean mice present a phase
   response curve with larger delays than advances, indicating that
   re-entrainment is more easily achieved by delays. Volcano obese mice are
   less efficient at re-entraining because they show smaller phase shifts
   in delays than control mice. These results indicate that obesity in N.
   alstoni has a negative effect on the circadian mechanisms that integrate
   the photic entrainment.},

Title = {Geographical analysis and conservation of the Andean fox Lycalopex
   culpaeus (Mammalia, Canidae) in Colombia},
Journal = {IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {106},
Abstract = {The Andean fox Lycalopex culpaeus (Molina, 1782) has been included in
   the category of threat Vulnerable in Colombia, however, there are not
   available studies that support at the national level the inclusion of
   this species in that category. In this work, we delimited the
   distribution area and we discuss the category of threat of the species
   in Colombia. For this, we used a niche modelling approach using the
   Maximun Entropy (Maxent) algorithm. Using Geographical Information
   Systems, we highlighted areas in which the species is protected. Our
   results show that the Andean fox can be found potentially from Narino
   until Huila departments (8,877 km(2)), and the National System of
   Protected Areas in Colombia protected 1,742 km(2) (19.6\%) of the
   potential distribution of the species. Despite the species is considered
   Vulnerable in Colombia, we found that it does not meet the criteria for
   allocation in that category, due to the absence of tangible evidence
   that supported a population decline, decreased in area of occupancy, or
   habitat quality in the decade prior to the risk assessment. Considering
   the validated records and information on the distribution area of the
   species in Colombia, we suggest a re-assignation of the category to the
   category Near Threatened (NT).},

Abstract = {Montane barriers influence the evolutionary history of lineages by
   promoting isolation of populations. The effects of these historical
   processes are evident in patterns of differentiation among extant
   populations, which are often expressed as genetic and behavioral
   variation between populations. We investigated the effects of geographic
   barriers on the evolutionary history of a Mesoamerican bird by studying
   patterns of genetic and vocal variation in the Ruddy-capped
   Nightingale-Thrush (Turdidae: Catharus frantzii), a non-migratory oscine
   bird that inhabits montane forests from central Mexico to Panama. We
   reconstructed the phylogeographic history and estimated divergence times
   between populations using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. We
   found strong support for the existence of four mitochondrial lineages of
   C. frantzii corresponding to isolated mountain ranges: Sierra Madre
   Oriental; Sierra Madre del Sur; the highlands of Chiapas, Guatemala, and
   El Salvador; and the Talamanca Cordillera. Vocal features in C frantzii
   were highly variable among the four observed clades, but vocal variation
   and genetic variation were uncorrelated. Song variation in C. frantzii
   suggests that sexual selection and cultural drift could be important
   factors driving song differentiation in C frantzii. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   is similar to Megalothorax Willem, 1900 and Neelus Folsom, 1896, but it
   clearly differs from all genera within family Neelidae by a peculiar
   combination of characters and the presence of some new features, e.g.
   globular sensillum on Ant. III, sword-like macro-setae on oral fold. A

Title = {Key constraints and problems affecting the inland fishery value chain in
   central Mexico},
Journal = {LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {27-40},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have been the major cause of watershed
   deterioration in many parts of the world, negatively impacting inland
   fisheries. In Mexico, freshwater fishing represents a source of protein,
   income, and employment for rural communities; however, in the national
   fisheries statistics they only account for 3\% of the total production,
   and increases have not taken place since the 1990s. Demand is higher
   than supply because the national market can only provide 50\% of
   consumption, and these fisheries are currently passing through a complex
   situation that prevents an increase in production levels and fishers'
   incomes. This study examined the main production constraints and
   problems that prevent production from increasing to satisfy national
   demand. We considered value chain analysis and fish catch dynamic
   approaches. Fieldwork was conducted in 2 periods during 2011 and 2012 in
   4 riparian communities near Lake Chapala and Lake Yuriria. The
   methodological approach considered socioeconomic factors and temporal
   variability of catch volume in both lakes. Results showed that
   production constraints are the result of watershed and fisheries
   mismanagement. Catch levels were strongly related to the environmental
   conditions of the lakes, which have shown instability and decline that
   affect fishers' livelihoods. In addition, illegal, unreported, and
   unregulated (IUU) fishing and the ineffectiveness of institutions to
   rule the actions of all actors who intervene in the management and use
   of these resources allow destructive strategies toward the fisheries.
   Finally, inland fisheries management is not considered part of watershed
   management policies, resulting in ill-adapted water allocation policies
   that affect fisheries production levels.},

Abstract = {Unit testing in the programming world has had a profound impact in the
   way modern complex systems are developed. Many Open Source and Free
   Software projects encourage (and in some cases, mandate) the use of unit
   tests for new code submissions, and many software companies around the
   world have incorporated unit testing as part of their standard
   developing practices. And although not all software engineers use them,
   very few (if at all) object their use. However, there is almost no
   research available pertaining the use of unit tests as a teaching tool
   in introductory programming courses. I have been teaching introductory
   programming courses in the Computer Sciences program at the Sciences
   Faculty in the National Autonomous University of Mexico for almost ten
   years, and since 2013 I have been using unit testing as a teaching tool
   in those courses. The intent of this paper is to discuss the results of
   this experience.},

Abstract = {The Rhinella granulosa group consists of 13 species of toads distributed
   throughout open areas of South America and Panama. In this paper we
   perform a phylogenetic analysis considering all but one species of the
   group, employing five nuclear and four mitochondrial genes, for up to
   7910 bp per specimen. Separate phylogenetic analyses under direct
   optimization (DO) of nuclear and mitochondrial sequences recovered the
   R. granulosa group as monophyletic and revealed topological incongruence
   that can be explained mainly by multiple events of hybridization and
   introgression, both mitochondrial and nuclear. The DO combined analysis,
   after the exclusion of putatively introgressed or heterozygous genomes,
   resulted in a phylogenetic hypothesis for the R. granulosa group in
   which most of the species are recovered as monophyletic, but with
   interspecific relationships poorly supported. The optimization of
   morphological (adult and larval), chromosomal, and behavioural
   characters resulted in 12 putative phenotypic synapomorphies for this
   species group and some other synapomorphies for internal clades. Our
   results indicate the need for additional population genetic studies on
   R. dorbignyi and R. fernandezae to corroborate the taxonomic status of
   both taxa. Finally, we discuss biological and genetic characteristics of
   Bufonidae, as possible explanations for the common occurrence of
   hybridization and introgression observed in some lineages of this
   family. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2015.},

Abstract = {This chapter describes the structure of a group of polymers responsible
   for regulating the basic functions and inheritance of living organisms:
   the proteins. The characterization of these organic units involves a
   very complex problem due to its multi-factorial nature. To develop this
   topic I showed the difficulty when trying to differentiate living matter
   from non-living matter and then I proceeded to find distinctions at
   cellular level. At this stage I identified two main groups with three
   types of major macromolecular structures, where proteins are included,
   and four levels of structural complexity known as primary, secondary,
   tertiary and quaternary structures, from which proteins get their
   morphologic features.},

   structure-activity relationship model (QSAR). I will discuss its
   advantages and disadvantages, and I will present a model called the
   polarity index method. This model shows a high degree of efficiency in
   predicting the main function of peptides and proteins by inspecting the
   linear sequence of macromolecules to evaluate a single physico-chemical
   property, polarity.},

Abstract = {Assuming that co-distributed species are exposed to similar
   environmental conditions, ecological niche models (ENMs) of bird and
   plant species inhabiting tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Mexico were
   developed to evaluate future projections of their distribution for the
   years 2050 and 2070. We used ENM-based predictions and climatic data for
   two Global Climate Models, considering two Representative Concentration
   Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5). We also evaluated the effects of
   habitat loss and the importance of the Mexican system of protected areas
   (PAs) on the projected models for a more detailed prediction of TDFs and
   to identify hot spots that require conservation actions. We identified
   four major distributional areas: the main one located along the Pacific
   Coast (from Sonora to Chiapas, including the Cape and Bajio regions, and
   the Balsas river basin), and three isolated areas: the Yucatan
   peninsula, central Veracruz, and southern Tamaulipas. When considering
   the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction (similar to 61\%) of
   the TDFs predicted area occurred, whereas climate-change models
   suggested (in comparison with the present distribution model) an
   increase in area of 3.0-10.0\% and 3.0-9.0\% for 2050 and 2070,
   respectively. In future scenarios, TDFs will occupy areas above its
   current average elevational distribution that are outside of its present
   geographical range. Our findings show that TDFs may persist in Mexican
   territory until the middle of the XXI century; however, the challenges
   about long-term conservation are partially addressed (only 7\%
   unaffected within the Mexican network of PAs) with the current Mexican
   PAs network. Based on our ENM approach, we suggest that a combination of
   models of species inhabiting present TDFs and taking into account change
   scenarios represent an invaluable tool to create new PAs and ecological
   corridors, as a response to the increasing levels of habitat destruction
   and the effects of climate change on this ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Coniferous forests occupy a large extent (17 \%) of the Mexican
   territory. Within these forests, pines are a common and sometimes
   dominant component; however, several abiotic and biotic factors affect
   pines growth. Among the main biotic factors is the parasitic effect of
   dwarf mistletoes. In Zoquiapan (Iztaccihuatl Popocatepetl National Park,
   Central Mexico) two dwarf mistletoe species coexist parasitizing Pinus
   hartwegii. The aim of this study was to know the effect of Arceuthobium
   globosum and A. vaginatum, either individually or as a pair, on P.
   hartwegii growth, allometric relations, and size susceptibility. We
   recorded diameter at breast height (dbh) and crown spread of P.
   hartwegii for 3 years on individuals infested by either one of the
   species, both, or none, as well as the infection severity. The relative
   growth rate (RGR) in diameter was strongly influenced by the pines
   initial dbh; whereas the infecting species or severity did not show a
   differential effect. The allometric relation of dbh and height was
   affected by parasitism, where the trees infected by both species were
   shorter than the uninfected and infected by A. vaginatum at the same
   dbh. The parasitic effect does not differ among these mistletoe
   species., However, the host-size structure affects the presence and
   severity of infection; maintaining even-age stands provides a better
   scenario for a milder effect of parasitism, which should be considered
   for managing plans.},

   study the statistical transition from quantum to classical interference.},

Abstract = {The quality of magnetic resonance images is greatly affected by the
   field uniformity of the RF coil. This problem used to detect the signal.
   There is a growing interest in high field magnetic resonance imaging
   mainly in applications involving animal models to study a variety of
   important diseases, where the image quality is of paramount importance.
   In the past 20 years a number of digital-processing image methodologies
   have been proposed to overcome this problem. Among these techniques, the
   mean-shift scheme has proved to be an efficient and reliable method at
   intermediate field magnetic resonance imaging The goal in this work is
   to apply the mean-shift scheme to phantom images with poor uniformity
   acquired with whole-body magnetic resonance imager at 4 Tesla.},

Title = {Age and Stock Analysis Using Otolith Shape in Gags from the Southern

Abstract = {On Campeche Bank (CB) in the southern Gulf of Mexico, Gags Mycteroperca
   microlepis are captured as part of a sequential multispecies fishery.
   Limited scientific data suggest that the Gag is the third most important
   commercial species in the region, contributing 21\% (total weight) of
   the overall grouper catch. Neither age nor stock data are currently
   available for Gags in this region, making it impossible to determine how
   this species is affected by current fishing practices. Such information
   is vital for the CB stock since it acts as a genetic source for a mixed
   Gag population on the west Florida shelf through a constant
   unidirectional flow of larvae. The goal of this study was to generate
   baseline age and stock structure data for Gags on CB. Age was quantified
   from otoliths by counting the number of annuli (indicated by the number
   of opaque zones from the otolith core to the margin) in thin sections.
   Otolith shape was analyzed by using discrete wavelet transforms, linear
   otolith morphometrics, and shape indices. In each of 198 specimens, age
   was determined based on examination of the right sagittal otolith, and
   shape analysis was conducted on the left sagittal otolith. Individual
   age ranged from 4 to 17 years, and otolith opaque band deposition
   occurred annually between December and February. Using principal
   components analysis and linear discriminant analysis, two distinct
   groups were identified (discrimination success =98\%), indicating the
   presence of substructure in the CB stock of Gags. Otolith analysis
   clearly assisted in achieving a better understanding of the CB Gag stock
   and in identifying the complexity within the stock, demonstrating that
   otolith analysis is a useful tool in characterizing fish populations.
   The study results highlight the urgent need for Gag stock assessment in
   this region and for the application of a cautious approach to fishery
   management given the immense gaps in biological data for this species.},

Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2016},

Pages = {139-155},
Abstract = {Cayo Arcas is a small, offshore reef complex on the southwest corner of
   Campeche Bank, Gulf of Mexico. The only published information (from
   2000) on the fishes of that reef refers to 37 species. Here additional
   information is added, some from unpublished observations during the
   1980s, as well as author observations made during 2013 and 2016. These
   bring the checklist of that reef's fishes up to 162 species. The
   possible effects of the limited number of fish habitats available at
   Cayo Arcas on the composition of its fish fauna are discussed. The
   Indo-Pacific damselfish Neopomacentrus cyanomos (Bleeker, 1856) was
   first recorded in the Atlantic in mid-2013, on shoreline reefs in the
   southwest corner of the Gulf of Mexico. Recently reviewed underwater
   photographs show that N. cyanomos also was present at Cayo Arcas in
   mid2013, 350 km from the first-record site. Hence it evidently had a
   substantial population in the southwest Gulf of Mexico in 2013, and must
   have arrived in there long before that year.},

Journal = {TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The genus Rickettsia includes obligate intracellular bacteria
   transmitted by several hematophagous arthropods such as ticks, fleas and
   sucking lice. In particular hard ticks (Ixodidae) have been cited as the
   main vectors of pathogenic rickettsiae in Mexico. However, there have
   been only two records of a single Rickettsia species associated with
   Mexican soft ticks (Argasidae). In this study, we searched for
   rickettsial DNA in argasid ticks (13 adults and eight nymphs of
   Ornithodoros yumatensis) from two bat caves in the state of Yucatan,
   Mexico. Additionally one larva collected in a cave from Chiapas, Mexico,
   and associated with Desmodus rotundus was used to corroborate the tick
   taxonomic determination. Of these, nine ticks (43\%) yielded expected
   PCR products for the rickettsial gltA gene. These PCR-positive ticks
   were tested with additional PCR protocols targeting the rickettsial
   genes gltA, ompA and ompB. DNA partial sequences from these genes showed
   99-100\% identities with Rickettsia lusitaniae, an agent isolated from
   O. erraticus in Portugal, and closely related to R. felis and R.
   hoogstraalii. Based on the results from this study, the inventory of
   rickettsiae distributed in Mexico increases from six to seven species.

Abstract = {We report the first case of ``Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii{''}
   detected in Amblyomma mixtum ticks on humans on the west coast of
   Mexico. This is the most western record of ``Ca. R. amblyommii{''} in
   the Western Hemisphere, representing the first record for the western
   coast of the Americas. Even if the record is far from the previously
   known locations for the species it does not represent a new record
   regarding temperature, precipitation and topographic parameters. Since
   ``Ca. R. amblyommii{''} antibodies have been detected in patients
   suspected of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and the tick A. mixtum has
   been associated with humans, it is important to consider ``Ca. R.
   amblyommii{''} as a potential risk for the human population that has not
   been considered at risk before. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {117},

Abstract = {Background and Aims: The genus Scutellinia is cosmopolitan. Seven
   species have been reported in Mexico. A partial taxonomic revision of
   the genus Scutellinia in the country is presented.
   Methods: Seven species were studied, using traditional mycological
   techniques.
   Key results: Three species are cited for the first time in the country:
   Scutellinia balansae, S. colensoi and S. pennsylvanica. The main
   characteristics used for species identification in this study are
   marginal hairs and the ascospore ornamentation. Taxonomic descriptions
   of the three new records and previously reported species for the country
   are realized.
   Conclusions: The taxonomic knowledge of Scutellinia in Mexico remains
   scarce, so the development of more studies focused on the fungal
   systematic in the country is necessary.},

Title = {Self-stability of C60 nanocapsules with radio-iodide content
   and its interaction with calcium atoms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper inquires the C-60 capabilities to contain radio-iodide
   (I-131(2)) molecules. The encapsulation conditions are investigated
   applying first principles method to simulate with geometric
   optimizations and molecular dynamics at 310 K and atmospheric pressure.
   We find that the n(131)I(2)@C-60 system, where n=1, 2, 3., is stable if
   the content does not exceed three molecules of radio-iodide. The
   application of density functional theory allows us to determine that,
   the nanocapsules content limit is related with the amount of charge that
   is transferred from the iodine I-131(2) molecules to the carbon atoms in
   the fullerene surface. The Mulliken population analysis reveals that the
   excess of charge increases the repulsive forces between atoms and the
   bond length average in the C-60 structure. The weakened bonds easily
   break and will critically damage the encapsulation properties.
   Additionally, we test the interaction nanocapsules with different
   amounts of radioactive iodine diatomic molecules content with calcium
   atoms, and find that only the fullerene containing one radioactive
   iodine diatomic molecule was able to interact with up to nine atoms of
   calcium without disrupting or cracking. Other fullerenes with two and
   three radio iodine diatomic molecules cannot resist the interaction with
   a single calcium atom without cracking or being broken.},

Abstract = {In the actual competitive software industry, software development
   organizations need a better and formal estimation approaches in order to
   increase the success rate of software projects. However, currently the
   estimation approach typically employed in industry is the expert
   judgment ('experience-based'). Using measures and estimations that
   continue to be based on researchers' intuition does not contribute to
   obtaining successful projects nor to mature software engineering.
   Any organization that aims to have or develop estimation approaches
   needs historical data, and the majority of the organizations do not have
   this information. Additionally acquisition of this information has
   expensive cost and time/effort consuming.
   This paper proposed the use of the EPCU approximation approach-that has
   demonstrated a several benefits- aiming to create a formal database with
   low cost and effort, that can be employed as a starting point to improve
   estimations in organizations without historical databases.},

Title = {Late stages of anther development and anther attributes in
   Microepidendrum differs from other genera of Epidendrum
   alliance (Orchidaceae)},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {35-43},
Abstract = {Late floral ontogeny is studied in representative species of the genera
   of Epidendrum alliance to re-examine the systematic position of the
   controversial Microepidendrum subulatifolium. Series of late floral
   stages were sampled from M. subulatifolium, Caularthron bilamellatum,
   Barkeria uniflora and Epidendrum ciliare. The samples were prepared for
   scanning electronic microscopy. Several characters that were observed
   during late floral development in Barkeria, Epidendrum and Caularthron
   in the Epidendrum alliance such as curvature of the column, wings on the
   column, ontogeny of the anther, conspicuous striate ornamentation of the
   cuticle of the epidermis of the anther wall, characteristic actinocytic
   stomata and their location on the anther, shape and number of caudicles,
   and shape of clinandrium, are not shared with M. subulatifolium. These
   characters suggest that the correct systematic position of M.
   subulatifolium might be in the Encyclia alliance as previously
   suggested. We determined the polarity of character states for three
   attributes in the Epidendrum alliance. The polarity regarding the degree
   of fusion between the lip and column within the Epidendrum alliance goes
   from free lip in Caularthron, lip adnate to column-foot in Orleanesia,
   lip attached only to the base of the column and the rest of the lip
   appressed to the column-part but not united with it in Barkeria, and a
   completely fused lip and column in Epidendrum. For curvature of the
   column, the trend goes from initially straight in early developmental
   stages to arcuate. Striae in the cuticle of the epidermis of the anther
   evolve from smooth to sparse to very conspicuous with radial and
   parallel cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

   morphological variability in relation to life-cycle phase},
Journal = {PHYCOLOGIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-242},
Abstract = {Hypnea musciformis is one of the most studied species of the genus
   Hypnea. It has a wide geographic range along the Atlantic, Pacific and
   Indian Oceans that would be consistent with an extensive intraspecific
   variation in morphology. Hypnea musciformis has been previously reported
   on coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula; however, neither morphological
   characterization nor molecular studies have been done for Gulf of Mexico
   or Mexican Caribbean populations. For the first time, we present a
   detailed morphoanatomical description of the tetrasporophytic,
   gametophytic and carposporophytic phases and its reproductive structures
   for this region, including the description of the male gametophyte.
   Mexican Caribbean samples showed morphological variation in branching
   pattern, branch abundance and branchlet types, and this was attributed
   to life-history phase and the reproductive status of the thalli.
   Molecular analysis of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
   gene and the 5' region of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit
   I gene markers allows us to confirm the unique genetic identity of
   Mexican specimens. The analysis of H. musciformis collected in different
   tropical areas showed a high degree of intraspecific variation and
   suggested the necessity of a combined analysis of morphology and
   different gene markers for a better understanding of its taxonomy and
   phylogeny.},

Title = {Climatic niche attributes and diversification in Anolis lizards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aim The aim of this study was to test the link between climatic niche
   dynamics and species diversification in Anolis on islands and on the
   mainland. We tested the hypotheses that lineages in warmer climates and
   with narrow climate niches diversified more than lineages in cold
   climates and with broad climate niches. We also tested the hypothesis
   that species-rich clades exhibit greater niche diversity than
   species-poor clades.
   Location Neotropics.
   Methods We collated occurrence records for 328 Anolis species to
   estimate niche breadth, niche position and occupied niche space (as a
   proxy for niche diversity). We compared niche breadth between insular
   and mainland Anolis species and among Anolis clades, controlling for the
   potential confounding effect of range size. Using two approaches
   (clade-based and QuaSSE) we explored the association between niche
   metrics and diversification rates in Anolis lizards.
   Results We found that Caribbean Anolis had a narrower niche breadth and
   niche space occupation compared to mainland anoles after controlling for
   range size differences. There was a significant association between
   niche traits (mean niche position and niche breadth) and diversification
   in anoles. Anole lineages with narrow niche breadths and that occupy
   warmer areas exhibited higher speciation rates than those with broader
   niche breadths and that occupy cold areas. Similarly, clades with higher
   total diversification exhibit more niche diversity than clades with
   lower total diversification.
   Main conclusions Climatic niche attributes play a role in anole
   diversification with some differences between mainland and insular anole
   lineages. Climatic niche differences between regions and clades likely
   are related to differences in niche evolutionary rates. This also
   suggests that climate plays a strong role in shaping species richness
   between and within mainland and islands.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The lion-paw scallop Nodipecten subnodosus is a commercially important
   resource in the northwest of Mexico; however few studies evaluate its
   growth. Length of shell was used to estimate individual growth
   parameters of the lion-paw scallop from a wild population. Monthly
   samplings were performed from January to December 2006 in Bahia de Los
   Angeles on the western coast of the Gulf of California, Mexico.
   Morphometric relationships between total length, height, total weight,
   and mass weight were estimated. The number of cohorts was determined
   monthly using the multinomial technique based on a likelihood function.
   The cohort that was best represented over time was used to fit the
   stationary growth model of von Bertalanffy. The results indicated that
   this species presents negative allometric growth and showed high
   correlation among different morphometric measures (R-2 > 0.88). Length
   frequency distributions showed two cohorts in each sample, except from
   August to November when there were up to three cohorts, with greater
   variance in those of intermediate sizes. The growth parameters were:
   L-infinity = 19.06 cm, k = 0.47 year(1), t(0) = -0.19 years, C = 0.38,
   ts = 0.37. Due to fluctuations in the growth of the species, assessments
   should be performed based on age-structured models to support fishery
   management measures for this species.},

Title = {Structural and Heterochronic Variations During the Early Ontogeny in
   Toads (Anura: Bufonidae)},
Journal = {HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {79-118},
Abstract = {In recent decades, a renewed interest in comparative studies of
   embryonic ontogeny in anurans is taking place. Toad embryos are often
   employed as model organisms, and scarce attention has been put on
   interspecific variations. In this work we analyze the development of
   transient embryonic and larval structures in 21 species in five genera
   of Bufonidae. These species vary in their ovipositional mode and the
   type of environments where the embryos and tadpoles develop, including
   ponds, streams, and axils of leaves of terrestrial or epiphytic plants.
   Comparative anatomical studies and sequence heterochrony analyses show
   that primary morphological variations occur in the morphology at the
   tail-bud stage, the arrangement and development of the external gills,
   adhesive gland type and division timing, growth of the dorsal hatching
   gland on the head, configuration of the oral disc, emergence and
   development of the hind limbs, and presence of the abdominal sucker.
   Some of these transformations are best explained by phylogeny (e.g.,
   early divergent taxa of bufonids have embryos with kyphotic body
   curvature, Type C adhesive glands, and a very small third pair of
   gills). Other traits might be correlated with reproductive modes (e.g.,
   phytotelmata embryos hatch comparatively late and show an accelerated
   development of hind limbs). Because these actual variations are not well
   studied (e.g., less than the 10\% of the known diversity of bufonids has
   been studied from this perspective), comprehensive analyses are required
   to interpret character evolution and the relationship with reproductive
   modes within the family.},

Abstract = {Quantitative evaluations of species distributional congruence allow
   evaluating previously proposed biogeographic regionalization and even
   identify undetected areas of endemism. The geographic scenery of
   Northwestern Argentina offers ideal conditions for the study of
   distributional patterns of species since the boundaries of a diverse
   group of biomes converge in a relatively small region, which also
   includes a diverse fauna of mammals. In this paper we applied a
   grid-based explicit method in order to recognize Patterns of
   Distributional Congruence (PDCs) and Areas of Endemism (AEs), and the
   species (native but non-endemic and endemic, respectively) that
   determine them. Also, we relate these distributional patterns to
   traditional biogeographic divisions of the study region and with a very
   recent phytogeographic study and we reconsider what previously rejected
   as `spurious' areas. Finally, we assessed the generality of the patterns
   found. The analysis resulted in 165 consensus areas, characterized by
   seven species of marsupials, 28 species of bats, and 63 species of
   rodents, which represents a large percentage of the total species (10,
   41, and 73, respectively). Twenty-five percent of the species that
   characterize consensus areas are endemic to the study region and define
   six AEs in strict sense while 12 PDCs are mainly defined by widely
   distributed species. While detailed quantitative analyses of plant
   species distribution data made by other authors does not result in units
   that correspond to Cabrera's phytogeographic divisions at this spatial
   scale, analyses of animal species distribution data does. We were able
   to identify previously unknown meaningful faunal patterns and more
   accurately define those already identified. We identify PDCs and AEs
   that conform Eastern Andean Slopes Patterns, Western High Andes
   Patterns, and Merged Eastern and Western Andean Slopes Patterns, some of
   which are re-interpreted at the light of known patterns of the endemic
   vascular flora. Endemism do not declines towards the south, but do
   declines towards the west of the study region. Peaks of endemism are
   found in the eastern Andean slopes in Jujuy and Tucuman/Catamarca, and
   in the western Andean biomes in Tucuman/Catamarca. The principal habitat
   types for endemic small mammal species are the eastern humid Andean
   slopes. Notwithstanding, arid/semi-arid biomes and humid landscapes are
   represented by the same number of AEs. Rodent species define 15 of the
   18 General Patterns, and only in one they have no participation at all.
   Clearly, at this spatial scale, non-flying mammals, particularly
   rodents, are biogeographically more valuable species than flying mammals
   (bat species).},

Abstract = {Clinopodium macrostemum var. laevigatum is a Mexican medicinal plant
   appreciated because of the pleasant smell of its leaves. This work
   describes the seasonal volatile content of the leaves by SPME technique
   as well as the GC-MS analyses of four seasonal essential oils. Menthone
   (similar to 34\%) and piperitone oxide (similar to 30\%) were the most
   abundant compounds in all the seasons studied. Antioxidant activity was
   determined in the seasonal essential oils by DPPH and beta-carotene
   bleaching methods revealing an IC50 range of 0.92-1.46 and 1.30-1.94 g
   L-1, respectively. The enzymatic assays with a-glucosidase and porcine
   pancreatic lipase showed a non-competitive inhibition caused by the
   essential oil of this plant. Seasonal IC50 range was 0.14-0.29 g L-1 for
   a-glucosidase and 0.12-0.34 g L-1 for porcine pancreatic lipase. The
   enzymatic assays with acetylcholinesterase demonstrated that the
   essential oil produced a competitive inhibition with a seasonal IC50
   range of 0.17-0.43 g L-1. The MIC's in g L-1 of the essential oil
   demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial activity on Erwinia carotovora
   (0.145), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (0.149), Clavibacter michiganensis
   (0.184), Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolitica (0.381), Pseudomonas
   syringae pv. glycinea (0.437), Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha
   (0.515), Fusarium oxysporum (2.3), Aspergillus niger (2.9) and Rhizopus
   stolonifer (3.6). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was
   maintained in the seasons studied. The described properties of the
   essential oil of this traditional crop could probably be used to design
   new products with industrial application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Effect of elastic colored noise in the hopping dynamics of single
   molecules in stretching experiments},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {The influence of colored noise induced by elastic fluctuations in
   single-molecule stretching experiments is theoretically and numerically
   studied. Unlike in the thermal white noise case currently considered in
   the literature, elastically induced hopping dynamics between folded and
   unfolded states is manifested through critical oscillations showing
   smaller end-to-end distance fluctuations (delta x similar to 1.25 nm)
   within the free energy wells corresponding to both states. Our results
   are derived by analyzing the elastic coupling between the
   Handle-Molecule-Handle system and the laser optical tweezers (LOT)
   array. It is shown that an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process related to this
   elastic coupling may trigger the hopping transitions via a colored noise
   with an intensity proportional to the elastic constant of the LOT array.
   Evolution equations of the variables of the system were derived by using
   the irreversible thermodynamics of small systems recently proposed.
   Theoretical expressions for the corresponding stationary probability
   densities are provided and the viability of inferring the shape of the
   free energy from direct measurements is discussed.},

Title = {Transcriptional cellular responses in midgut tissue of Aedes
   aegypti larvae following intoxication with Cry11Aa toxin from
   Bacillus thuringiensis},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Background: Although much is known about the mechanism of action of
   Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins, the target tissue cellular responses
   to toxin activity is less understood. Previous transcriptomic studies
   indicated that significant changes in gene expression occurred during
   intoxication. However, most of these studies were done in organisms
   without a sequenced and annotated reference genome. A reference genome
   and transcriptome is available for the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and its
   importance as a disease vector has positioned its biological control as
   a primary health concern. Through RNA sequencing we sought to determine
   the transcriptional changes observed during intoxication by Cry11Aa in
   A. aegypti and to analyze possible defense and recovery mechanisms
   engaged after toxin ingestion.
   Results: In this work the changes in the transcriptome of 4th instar A.
   aegypti larvae exposed to Cry11Aa toxin for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h were
   analyzed. A total of 1060 differentially expressed genes after toxin
   ingestion were identified with two bioconductoR packages: DESeq2 and
   EdgeR. The most important transcriptional changes were observed after 9
   or 12 h of toxin exposure. GO enrichment analysis of molecular function
   and biological process were performed as well as Interpro protein
   functional domains and pBLAST analyses. Up regulated processes include
   vesicular trafficking, small GTPase signaling, MAPK pathways, and lipid
   metabolism. In contrast, down regulated functions are related to
   transmembrane transport, detoxification mechanisms, cell proliferation
   and metabolism enzymes. Validation with RT-qPCR showed large agreement
   with Cry11Aa intoxication since these changes were not observed with
   untreated larvae or larvae treated with non-toxic Cry11Aa mutants,
   indicating that a fully functional pore forming Cry toxin is required
   for the observed transcriptional responses.
   Conclusions: This study presents the first transcriptome of Cry
   intoxication response in a fully sequenced insect, and reveals possible
   conserved cellular processes that enable larvae to contend with Cry
   intoxication in the disease vector A. aegypti. We found some
   similarities of the mosquito responses to Cry11Aa toxin with previously
   observed responses to other Cry toxins in different insect orders and in
   nematodes suggesting a conserved response to pore forming toxins.
   Surprisingly some of these responses also correlate with transcriptional
   changes observed in Bti-resistant and Cry11Aa-resistant mosquito larvae.},

Abstract = {Background: The loss of duplicate genes - fractionation - after whole
   genome doubling (WGD) is the subject to a debate as to whether it
   proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene chromosomal
   segments.
   Results: WGD produces two copies of every chromosome, namely two
   identical copies of a sequence of genes. We assume deletion events
   excise a geometrically distributed number of consecutive genes with mean
   mu >= 1, and these events can combine to produce single-copy runs of
   length l. If mu = 1, the process is gene-by-gene. If mu > 1, the process
   at least occasionally excises more than one gene at a time. In the
   latter case if deletions overlap, the later one simply extends the
   existing run of single-copy genes. We explore aspects of the predicted
   distribution of the lengths of single-copy regions analytically, but
   resort to simulations to show how observing run lengths l allows us to
   discriminate between the two hypotheses.
   Conclusions: Deletion run length distributions can discriminate between
   gene-by-gene fractionation and deletion of segments of geometrically
   distributed length, even if mu is only slightly larger than 1, as long
   as the genome is large enough and fractionation has not proceeded too
   far towards completion.},

Title = {A method for positive forensic identification of samples from extremely
   low-coverage sequence data},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Background: Determining whether two DNA samples originate from the same
   individual is difficult when the amount of retrievable DNA is limited.
   This is often the case for ancient, historic, and forensic samples. The
   most widely used approaches rely on amplification of a defined panel of
   multi-allelic markers and comparison to similar data from other samples.
   When the amount retrievable DNA is low these approaches fail.
   Results: We describe a new method for assessing whether shotgun DNA
   sequence data from two samples are consistent with originating from the
   same or different individuals. Our approach makes use of the large
   catalogs of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to maximize the
   chances of observing potentially discriminating alleles. We further
   reduce the amount of data required by taking advantage of patterns of
   linkage disequilibrium modeled by a reference panel of haplotypes to
   indirectly compare observations at pairs of linked SNPs. Using both
   coalescent simulations and real sequencing data from modern and ancient
   sources, we show that this approach is robust with respect to the
   reference panel and has power to detect positive identity from DNA
   libraries with less than 1 \% random and non-overlapping genome coverage
   in each sample.
   Conclusion: We present a powerful new approach that can determine
   whether DNA from two samples originated from the same individual even
   when only minute quantities of DNA are recoverable from each.},

Abstract = {We study vertex colorings of hypergraphs, such that all color sizes
   differ at most in one (balanced colorings) and each edge contains at
   least two vertices of the same color (rainbow-free colorings). Given a
   hypergraph H, the maximum k, such that there is a balanced rainbow-free
   k-coloring of H is called the balanced upper chromatic number denoted by
   (chi) over bar (b)(H). Concerning hypergraphs defined by projective
   spaces, bounds on the balanced upper chromatic number and constructions
   of rainbow-free colorings are given. For cyclic projective planes of
   order q we prove that:
   q(2) + q + 1/6 <= (chi) over bar (b)(Pi(q)) <= q(2) + q + 1/3.
   We also give bounds for the balanced upper chromatic numbers of the
   hypergraphs arising from the n-dimensional finite space PG(n, q). (C)

Title = {H-kernels and H-obstructions in H-colored digraphs},
Journal = {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2015},

Pages = {2288-2294},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Let D be a digraph. V(D) and A(D) will denote the vertex and arc sets of
   D respectively. A kernel K of a digraph D is an independent set of
   vertices of D such that for every vertex w in V(D)-K there exists an arc
   from w to a vertex in K. Let H be a digraph possibly with loops and D a
   digraph without loops whose arcs are colored with the vertices of H (D
   is said to be an H-colored digraph). A directed path W in D is said to
   be an H-path if and only if the consecutive colors encountered on W form
   a directed walk in H. A generalization of the concept of kernel is the
   concept of H-kernel, where an H-kernel N of an H-colored digraph D is a
   set of vertices of D such that for every pair of different vertices in N
   there is no H-path between them, and for every vertex u in V(D)-N there
   exists an H-path in D from u to N. A classical result in kernel theory
   establishes that if D is a digraph without cycles of odd length, then D
   has a kernel; this result is known as Richardson's theorem and in this
   paper we will show an extension of this theorem which is given by the
   main result.
   Let D be an H-colored digraph. For an arc (z(1), z(2)) of D we will
   denote its color by c(z(1), z(2)). We introduce the concept of
   obstruction in an H-colored digraph as follows. Let W = (v(0),
   v(1),...,v(n-1), v(0)) be a closed directed walk in D. We will say that
   there is an obstruction on v(i) if (c(v(i-1), v(i)), c(v(i), v(i+1))) is
   not an arc of A(H) (indices modulo n). The main result establishes that
   if D is an H-colored digraph such that the number of obstructions in
   every closed directed trail of D is even, then D has an H-kernel.
   Previous interesting results are generalized, as for example Sands,
   Sauer and Woodrow's theorem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Arthropod Distribution in a Tropical Rainforest: Tackling a Four
   Dimensional Puzzle},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Quantifying the spatio-temporal distribution of arthropods in tropical
   rainforests represents a first step towards scrutinizing the global
   distribution of biodiversity on Earth. To date most studies have focused
   on narrow taxonomic groups or lack a design that allows partitioning of
   the components of diversity. Here, we consider an exceptionally large
   dataset (113,952 individuals representing 5,858 species), obtained from
   the San Lorenzo forest in Panama, where the phylogenetic breadth of
   arthropod taxa was surveyed using 14 protocols targeting the soil,
   litter, understory, lower and upper canopy habitats, replicated across
   seasons in 2003 and 2004. This dataset is used to explore the relative
   influence of horizontal, vertical and seasonal drivers of arthropod
   distribution in this forest. We considered arthropod abundance, observed
   and estimated species richness, additive decomposition of species
   richness, multiplicative partitioning of species diversity, variation in
   species composition, species turnover and guild structure as components
   of diversity. At the scale of our study (2km of distance, 40m in height
   and 400 days), the effects related to the vertical and seasonal
   dimensions were most important. Most adult arthropods were collected
   from the soil/litter or the upper canopy and species richness was
   highest in the canopy. We compared the distribution of arthropods and
   trees within our study system. Effects related to the seasonal dimension
   were stronger for arthropods than for trees. We conclude that: (1)
   models of beta diversity developed for tropical trees are unlikely to be
   applicable to tropical arthropods; (2) it is imperative that estimates
   of global biodiversity derived from mass collecting of arthropods in
   tropical rainforests embrace the strong vertical and seasonal
   partitioning observed here; and (3) given the high species turnover
   observed between seasons, global climate change may have severe
   consequences for rainforest arthropods.},

Abstract = {Inventorying biodiversity is basic for conservation and natural
   resources management because constant loss of natural areas increases
   the need for fast biodiversity inventories. Desert flea diversity and
   associations are not well known in Mexican deserts, especially in the
   Oriental Basin (OB). Rodents were trapped in the Oriental Basin through
   June 2007, 2009, and 2010, and July 2008, in 10 localities. A total of
   144 rodents belonging to 10 species were trapped, of which 133 were
   parasitized by 350 fleas belonging to 18 species. Peromyscus difficilis
   had the highest parasite richness with 9 species, followed by P
   maniculatus with 8. The most abundant fleas in the OB were Polygenis
   vazquezi, Plusaetis parus, Meringis altipecten, and Plusaetis mathesoni.
   Seven species were found representing new records for 3 states. All

Abstract = {Argentatin B has been shown to inhibit the growth of colon HCT-15, and
   prostate PC-3 cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which argentatin B
   inhibits cell proliferation is still unknown. We aimed to investigate
   the mechanism by which argentatin B inhibits cell proliferation. The
   cell cycle was studied by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was evaluated by
   Annexin-V-Fluos, and Hoechst 33342 dye staining. Cell senescence was
   evaluated by proliferation tests, and staining for SA--galactosidase.
   Senescence-related proteins (PCNA, p21, and p27) were analyzed by
   Western blotting. Potential toxicity of argentatin B was evaluated in
   CD-1 mice. Its effect on tumor growth was tested in a HCT-15 and PC-3
   xenograft model. Argentatin B induced an increment of cells in sub G1,
   but did not produce apoptosis. Proliferation of both cell lines was
   inhibited by argentatin B. Forty-three percent HCT-15, and 66\% PC-3
   cells showed positive SA--galactosidase staining. The expression of PCNA
   was decreased, p21 expression was increased in both cell lines, but p27
   expression increased only in PC-3 cells after treatment. Administration
   of argentatin B to healthy mice did not produce treatment-associated
   pathologies. However, it restricted the growth of HCT-15 and PC-3
   tumors. These results indicate that treatment with argentatin B induces
   cell senescence.},

Abstract = {For every n >= 1, let cc(R-n) denote the hyperspace of all non-empty
   compact convex subsets of the Euclidean space R-n endowed with the
   Hausdorff metric topology. For every non-empty convex subset D of {[}0,
   infinity) we denote by cw(D)(R-n) the subspace of cc(R-n) consisting of
   all compact convex sets of constant width d is an element of D and by
   crwD(R-n) the subspace of the product cc(R-n) x cc(R-n) consisting of
   all pairs of compact convex sets of constant relative width d is an
   element of D. In this paper we prove that cw(D)(R-n) and erw(D)(R-n) are
   homeomorphic to D X R-n x Q, whenever D not equal \{0\} and n >= 2,
   where Q denotes the Hilbert cube. In particular, the hyperspace cw(R-n)
   of all compact convex bodies of constant width as well as the hyperspace
   crw(R-n) of all pairs of compact convex sets of constant relative
   positive width are homeomorphic to Rn+1 X Q. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Solvent-free functionalization of carbon nanotube buckypaper with amines},
Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {357},
Number = {B},
Pages = {1355-1368},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {We demonstrate the possibility of fast and efficient solvent-free
   functionalization of buckypaper (BP) mats prefabricated from oxidized
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-ox), by using three representative
   amines of different structure: one monofunctional aliphatic amine,
   octadecylamine (ODA), one monofunctional aromatic amine, 1-aminopyrene
   (AP), and one aromatic diamine, 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN). The
   functionalization procedure, which relies on the formation of amide
   bonds with carboxylic groups of MWCNTs-ox, is performed at 150-180
   degrees C under reduced pressure and takes about 4 h including auxiliary
   degassing. The amine-treated BP samples (BP-ODA, BP-AP and BP-DAN,
   respectively) were characterized by means of a variety of analytical
   techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy,
   thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy, scanning helium ion microscopy, and
   atomic force microscopy. The highest amine content was found for BP-ODA,
   and the lowest one was observed for BP-DAN, with a possible contribution
   of non-covalently bonded amine molecules in all three cases. Despite of
   some differences in spectral and morphological characteristics for
   amine-functionalized BP samples, they have in common a dramatically
   increased stability in water as compared to pristine BP and, on the
   other hand, a relatively invariable electrical conductivity. (C) 2015

Title = {First phylogenetic analysis of the tribe Phyllotini (Rodentia:
   Sigmodontinae) combining morphological and molecular data},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {593-620},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Previous phylogenetic analyses of the tribe Phyllotini, one of the
   largest components of the subfamily Sigmodontinae, have been based on a
   single source of evidence. In particular, morphological analyses were
   largely based on craniodental data, almost neglecting the potential
   phylogenetic information present in the postcranium. Despite the
   significant advances made in relation to the knowledge of phyllotine
   phylogeny in recent times, there are several unsolved issues that
   highlight the importance of a phylogenetic analysis that integrates
   multiple sources of evidence, including previously considered sources as
   well as new sources of data. We present here the first combined
   phylogenetic analysis (morphological and molecular) of phyllotines,
   which includes the widest taxon and character sampling to date. Our
   dataset includes 164 morphological characters, of which 83 are
   postcranial characters, plus 3561 molecular characters, scored for 52
   species from 34 genera of Oryzomyalia. In this study 75 postcranial
   characters not previously considered in this group are thoroughly
   described, and their utility for solving the relationships within
   Phyllotini is evaluated by means of different complementary analyses.
   Phyllotini was retrieved as a monophyletic clade in the combined
   analysis, with a composition that matches that obtained in most other
   recent analyses. All genera of phyllotines were monophyletic and show
   high support values. Abrotrichini, Akodontini and Oryzomyini were also
   monophyletic. The inclusion of postcranial data appears to be of limited
   utility to solve the phylogenetic relationships within Phyllotini. (C)

Title = {Quantum unitary dynamics in cosmological spacetimes},
Journal = {ANNALS OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {363},
Pages = {36-47},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We address the question of unitary implementation of the dynamics for
   scalar fields in cosmological scenarios. Together with invariance under
   spatial isometries, the requirement of a unitary evolution singles out a
   rescaling of the scalar field and a unitary equivalence class of Fock
   representations for the associated canonical commutation relations.
   Moreover, this criterion provides as well a privileged quantization for
   the unscaled field, even though the associated dynamics is not unitarily
   implernentable in that case. We discuss the relation between the initial
   data that determine the Fock representations in the rescaled and
   unscaled descriptions, and clarify that the S-matrix is well defined in
   both cases. In our discussion, we also comment on a recently proposed
   generalized notion of unitary implementation of the dynamics, making
   clear the difference with the standard unitarity criterion and showing
   that the two approaches are not equivalent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

   Limpets displacement velocity was 10.0 +/- 3.9 cm h(-1) during the light
   phase and 8.4 +/- 1.6 cm h(-1) during the dark phase. The
   thermotolerance (measured as CTMax at 50\%) was determined in a keyhole
   limpet in three acclimation temperatures 17, 20, and 23 degrees C.
   Limpets were subjected to water increasing temperatures at a rate of 1
   degrees C every 30 min, until they detached from the substrate. The

Abstract = {In this study, we propose a model to assess the effect of temperature on
   the incidence of dengue fever. For this, we take into account the
   dependence of the entomological and epidemiological parameters of the
   transmitter vector Aedes aegypti with respect to the temperature. The
   model consists of an ODE system that describes the transmission between
   humans and mosquitoes considering the aquatic stage of the vector
   population. The qualitative analysis of the model is made in terms of
   the parameters R-M and R-0, which represent the basic offspring of
   mosquitoes, and the basic reproductive number of the disease,
   respectively. If R-M < 1 mosquito population extinguishes while for R-M
   > 1 it tends asymptotically to a nonzero equilibrium. Analogously, the
   disease transmission is eliminated if R0 < 1, and it approaches an
   endemic equilibrium for R-0 > 1. Using entomological data of mosquitoes
   as well as experimental data of disease transmission we evaluate R-M and
   R-0 at different temperatures, obtaining that around 30 degrees C both
   parameters attain their maximum. Sensitivity analysis reveals that
   infection rates and mosquito mortality are the parameters for which R-0
   is more sensitive.},

Abstract = {Trophic resources used by Plebeia intermedia in the locality of Barito,
   Salta, Argentina. Botanical characterization of its honeys. With the
   purpose of knowing the trophic resources used by Plebeia intermedia, a
   stingless bee of frequent use in Barit0 locality (22 degrees 28' 54.1 `'
   S; 64 degrees 45' 39.4 `' W; at 1546 masl), ten honey samples were
   melissopalynologically analyzed, collected in September and October of
   2011 and in January of 2012. The qualitative examinations showed a
   certain specialization of these bees for using native and arboreal
   plants, and with flowers clustered in dense inflorescences (mass
   flowering). The dominant pollen types that originated monofloral honeys
   were Allophylus edulis (Sapindaceae), Blepharocalyx salicifolius
   (Myrtaceae) and Myrcianthes pseudomato (Myrtaceae), followed by
   Handroanthus ochraceus (Bignoniaceae), Ilex argentina (Aquifoliaceae),
   Parapiptadenia excelsa (Leguminosae) and Sambucus peruviana (Adoxaceae).
   Other pollen types observed in the samples, with frequency classes
   important minor or secondary, were Eupatorium (Compositae), Senecio
   (Compositae), Paullinia (Sapindaceae) and pollens of the families
   Boraginaceae and Rhamnaceae. The realized examinations in the honeys of
   Plebeia intermedia and results obtained in this study, constitute the
   first data on the trophic resources used by this species of stingless
   bee in the period spring - summer.},

Abstract = {Riparian remnants are linear strips of vegetation immediately adjacent
   to rivers that may act as refuges for biodiversity, depending on their
   habitat quality. In this study, we evaluated the role of riparian
   remnants in contributing to the diversity of leaf-litter ants by
   determining the relationship between ant diversity and several riparian
   habitat characteristics within a human-dominated landscape in Veracruz,
   Mexico. Sampling was carried out in 2012 during both dry and rainy
   seasons at 12 transects 100 m in length, where 10 leaf-litter samples
   were collected along each transect and processed with Berlese- Tullgren
   funnels and Winkler sacks. A total of 8,684 individuals belonging to 53
   species, 22 genera, and seven subfamilies were collected. The observed
   mean alpha diversity accounted for 34.4\% of the total species recorded
   and beta diversity for 65.6\%. Species richness and composition were
   significantly related to litter-layer depth and soil compaction, which
   could limit the distribution of ant species depending on their nesting,
   feeding, and foraging habits. Riparian remnants can contribute toward
   the conservation of ant assemblages and likely other invertebrate
   communities that are threatened by anthropogenic pressures. In
   human-dominated landscapes where remnants of riparian vegetation give
   refuge to a diverse array of myrmecofauna, the protection of the few
   remaining and well-preserved riparian sites is essential for the
   long-term maintenance of biodiversity.},

Abstract = {In tropical dry landscapes, biodiversity conservation is dependent upon
   both the protection of natural areas and the sustainable management of
   the agricultural matrix. We analyzed the taxonomic, species and
   functional group diversity of ants in three neighboring habitats with
   different degrees of anthropic disturbance in Veracruz, Mexico. A total
   of 34,957 ant workers belonging to 89 species, 34 genera, 19 tribes and
   7 subfamilies were recorded. Primary forest had the highest species
   richness and most even distribution of species among the taxonomic
   levels, followed by secondary forest and active pasture. Because high
   species turnover among habitats increased species richness at the
   landscape level, the three neighboring habitats that we sampled are
   important for conservation biodiversity and together have a high
   conservation value for ants and probably for other invertebrates as
   well. Species of specialized functional groups were more frequent in
   primary forest, while those belonging to generalist and opportunistic
   groups were more frequent in active pasture. Human-disturbed areas in
   the vicinity of protected areas have an important role as reservoirs of
   biodiversity and should be included in landscape management practices
   designed to improve arthropod conservation in the tropics.},

Title = {DEVELOPMENTAL MORPHOLOGY OF BUD GALLS INDUCED ON THE VEGETATIVE

Abstract = {A gall is the result of complex interactions between a gall
   inducing-insect and its host plant. Certain groups of insects have the
   ability to induce a new structure, a gall, on plant organs by altering
   the normal growth of the host involved plant organ. The gall usually
   provides shelter and nutrients, in addition to protection against
   adverse environmental conditions and natural enemies to the inducing
   insect and its offspring. The ecological uniqueness of a gall is that it
   allows the inducing-insect to complete their life cycles. In this study,
   we have described the structures of different stages of growth of a gall
   induced by Amphibolips michoacaensis on the buds of leaves on Quercus
   castanea (Fagaceae) to know the subcellular changes during development.
   The gall consist of various layers such as a nutritive tissue, a
   lignified sheath, a spongy layer and an outermost epidermis around a
   centrally located larval chamber. The nutritive cell of the larval
   chamber show nuclear and nucleolar hypertrophy in the early phases of
   growth. The granular profile of the nucleolus suggests an active
   synthesis of ribosomes indicating an accelerated protein synthesis in
   these cells. During early stages of growth. the cells of the spongy
   layers within galls are nucleate and nucleolate and include amyloplasts,
   and the cytoplasm is less abundant. During later growth stages, the
   spongy cells are enucleate and enucleolate. Chloroplasts occur in the
   epidermal cells during early stages of growth, indicating that galls are
   photosynthetically active in early stages of growth. During intermediate
   stages of growth, a gradual loss of cellular components occurs
   commencing in the epidermal cells and progressing towards the nutritive
   cells.},

   The species shows weedy tendencies at each site. It is possible that A.
   prostrata arrived to Mexico through horticulture and later escaped from
   cultivation. This species needs to be included in the list of Mexican
   prohibited weeds, thus permitting the implementation of preventive
   strategies to avoid its spreading in the country.},

Abstract = {The sliver of humid tropical and montane forest on the east slope of the
   Andes in Ayacucho Department ranks among the least surveyed sectors of
   the Peruvian Andes. This mountainous region, along with adjacent
   Apurimac Department and western Cuzco Department, comprise the Apurimac
   River Valley, a putative biogeographic barrier. Hence, understanding
   avian distributions in the vicinity of the Apurimac River Valley is
   fundamental to understanding faunal turnover across it. Here, we report
   results of recent avifaunal surveys (2008-2012) from five sites in the
   Apurimac Valley region. We report 35 bird species previously
   undocumented in Ayacucho, six of which represent range extensions,
   including records of the endemic Black-spectacled Brush-Finch (Atlapetes
   melanopsis), Marcapata Spinetail (Cranioleuca marcapatae), and
   Chestnut-breasted Mountain-Finch (Poospiza caesar); the remaining
   records filled perceived range gaps. Specimen evidence suggests little
   phenotypic introgression between differentiated forms across the region,
   except for apparent introgression zones in Superciliaried Hemispingus
   (Hemispingus superciliaris) and Mountain Cacique (Cacicus chrysonotus);
   these observations uphold the idea that the Apurimac River Valley
   functions to isolate bird populations. Specimens of two Grallaria sp.
   and one Scytalopus sp. may represent new taxa, two of which appear to be
   endemic to Ayacucho (the third extends into adjacent Junin Department).
   More generally, montane forest bird species richness and avian endemism
   in eastern Ayacucho are similar to those of Cuzco and Pasco departments;
   previous assessments that considered Ayacucho as an area of reduced
   diversity were misled by sparse sampling effort. Received 4 December
   2014. Accepted 23 July 2015.},

Abstract = {The first experiments in maturation, spawning and larval rearing of
   spotted seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus in Sisal, Mexico were conducted.
   Sexual maturation and spontaneous spawning in wild captured fish after
   20 months in captivity were obtained. In a spawning period of 88 days,
   28 spawns were observed, of which 17 were viable. In total 28 x 10(6)
   eggs were collected, 70\% of viability and 91\% of fertilization was
   observed. The spawned eggs had mean diameter of 710 +/- 8 mu m with an
   oil droplet of 199 +/- 9 mu m. The percentage hatching of viable eggs
   was 96\% and larval survival at 48 h after hatching was 79\%. At 48 h
   post-hatch (PH), no traces of yolk and only traces of the oil droplet
   were observed. The most appropriate period for first feeding period is
   between 30 and 42 h PH, after which the mean survival decreases sharply
   to 9.3 +/- 4.4\% and 11.3 +/- 4.8\% at 54 h PH and 66 h PH,
   respectively. The larval rearing was done in 2 tanks, 4-m(3) with an
   initial density of 75 viable eggs L-1 (95.6\% fertilization, hatching
   97.7\% and 88.8\% survival at 48 h). Survivals were 0.4 and 1.2\% at 26
   days, with 1011 and 2903 juveniles harvested, with wet weights of 0.13
   +/- 0.04 g and 0.16 +/- 0.03 g and total lengths of 25.3 +/- 2.6 mm and
   27.4 +/- 1.9 mm respectively. Final densities and biomasses were 0.25

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between genetic research,
   nationalism and the construction of collective social identities in
   Latin America. It makes a comparative analysis of two research projects
   - the Genoma Mexicano' and the Homo Brasilis' - both of which sought to
   establish national and genetic profiles. Both have reproduced and
   strengthened the idea of their respective nations of focus,
   incorporating biological elements into debates on social identities.
   Also, both have placed the unifying figure of the mestizo/mestico at the
   heart of national identity constructions, and in so doing have displaced
   alternative identity categories, such as those based on race. However,
   having been developed in different national contexts, these projects
   have had distinct scientific and social trajectories: in Mexico, the
   genomic mestizo is mobilized mainly in relation to health, while in
   Brazil the key arena is that of race. We show the importance of the
   nation as a frame for mobilizing genetic data in public policy debates,
   and demonstrate how race comes in and out of focus in different Latin
   American national contexts of genomic research, while never completely
   disappearing.},

Title = {Russulaceae associated with mycoheterotroph Monotropa uniflora
   (Ericaceae) in Tlaxcala, Mexico: a phylogenetic approach},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore the systematic position of the
   fungi associated with the roots of M. uniflora in two localities of
   Tlaxcala, Mexico, using a phylogenetic approach. Thirty plants were
   sampled, fifteen from a coniferous forest dominated by Abies religiosa
   in La Malinche National Park, and fifteen from a mixed conifer-broadleaf
   forest dominated by pseudotsuga menziesii in Sierra de Tlaxco. Our ITS
   analysis confirms the preference of M. uniflora to associate with
   Russulaceae, in particularly with russula species. The roots of each
   plant were associated with a single fungal ITS sequence. They were
   analyzed phylogenetically by maximum likelihood, and were recovered in
   12 moderate to well-supported clades within the genus russula. In each
   of these clades only a single russula species was associated with
   Monotropa in Mexico, except for clade Integrae for which two Mexican
   species were retrieved. A total of 13 russula species were retrieved
   from the 30 Monotropa plants, four from La Malinche National Park, and
   11 from Sierra de Tlaxco. Two species, R. aff. olivobrunnea and one
   unidentified species in subsection Lactarioideae, were shared among both
   localities. The Monotropa in the Abies forest of La Malinche National
   Park were dominated by a single species, R. aff. olivobrunnea, present
   in 11 of the 15 plants. In the pseudotsuga forest of Sierra de Tlaxco,
   Monotropa was associated with a higher diversity of russula, eleven
   species in total, seven of which were associated with a single plant,
   while the four other russula had each been retrieved from two plants.
   Higher diversity of ectomycorrhizal host trees in the Sierra de Tlaxco
   site might possibly explain the higher richness of fungal associates as
   suggested by host association patterns of the involved species groups.
   This study brings the total number of russula species that associate
   with Monotropa to forty-four. In the distribution area of
   Monotropoideae, nearly all terminal russula clades (i.e. subsection
   level) that are involved in this mycoheterotroph association, equally
   harbor species that associate with mycoheterotroph orchids, whereas
   gasteromycetation appears to have exclusively evolved in clades that
   also harbor species developing mycoheterotroph associations.},

Abstract = {The THz and infrared photonic dispersion relations of superlattices
   composed of polaritonic material and bismuth (Bi) layers are
   theoretically investigated. The semimetal Bi presents a far-infrared
   response described by a Drude-like formula with a large high-frequency
   background dielectric constant. We have considered three different
   polaritonic materials: NaBr, LiCl and LiH, such that the Bi plasma
   frequency lies above, in-between and below the characteristic
   frequencies of the polaritonic materials, respectively. Investigating
   the photonic band structure of each superlattice, we have found that
   when the Bi plasma frequency lies below the polaritonic gap, appears a
   photonic pass band of negative dispersion for TM modes just above the
   longitudinal-optical phonon frequency, attributed to the frequency
   dependence of the permittivity for the polaritonic material and the
   large high-frequency background dielectric constant for Bi, that can be
   relevant to the metamaterials community. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Volume = {18},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Understanding social perceptions of rural communities is essential to
   construct public policy and management alternatives, not only to
   maintain natural ecosystems but also to deal with a changing environment
   due to climatic change. Because climate variability in Mexico has
   important socio-economic and environmental impacts, it is necessary to
   build capacities for adaptation. We describe social perceptions of three
   main local stakeholders (that is, farmers, elders, and local
   authorities), regarding their relationships with rainforest and local
   adaptation to climate change in eleven rural communities in Marqu,s de
   Comillas municipality, Chiapas, Southern Mexico. We based in a
   qualitative approach and used participant observation and
   semi-structured interviews. Even certain subtly variation among
   stakeholders, we recognized some underlying ideas behind perceptions.
   Rainforest is considered crucial to maintain human livelihoods and to
   mitigate climatic changes. They perceived changes in climate occurring
   in the region, such as raising temperature, unpredictable rainfall, and
   streams becoming dry. Local organization and government involved in
   managing rainforest or dealing with climatic changes are practically
   absent. This emphasizes the needs bring proper and reliable information
   to make decisions regarding rainforest use and management, but also to
   adapt to a changing climate. The loss of the collective character of the
   communities and, certain conflicts in public policies that mirrored in
   the coexistence of initiatives with contrasting objectives are proposed
   as particularly important for understanding the emergence of these
   perceptions. We proposed some recommendations to bolster regional
   capacities addressing climate change. Involving stakeholders such as
   governmental and non-governmental institutions is also imperative.},

Abstract = {Teleost fishes exhibit a range of spawning modes that differ among the
   recruitment and timing of release of gametes. Oocyte staging is critical
   for understanding when females will spawn and in what spawning mode.
   Most of the data on reproductive biology of marine fishes is generated
   by fisheries biologists using specimens that are not archived in museum
   collections. We turned to these collections to investigate reproductive
   biology, including spawning mode and frequency, in the deep-sea
   hermaphrodite, the Shortnose Green Eye, Chlorophthalmus agassizi.
   Histological examination of specimens preserved over 50 years ago
   revealed both ovarian and testicular tissues in an ovotestis.
   Simultaneous activity of the female germinal epithelium and ongoing
   oocyte maturation and ovulation in these fishes which were preserved
   while spawning constitutes the basic mechanism of the asynchronous
   spawning mode in fishes: the germinal epithelium produces new follicles
   during or between spawning events. Well-preserved, archival museum
   specimens can provide information on reproductive biology for many taxa,
   especially rare species, which may never be the subject of detailed
   fisheries biology studies.},

Abstract = {We report new records and range extensions for 7 bird species in the
   Biosphere Reserve Sierra Gorda, Guanajuato, Mexico. Five of these
   species (Trogon mexicanus, Ara militaris, Cyanocorax yncas, Euphonia
   elegantissima and Spinus notatus) extend their known distribution and 2
   (Buteogallus anthracinus and Myiozetetes similis) were not reported for
   the state, in addition to 98 other bird species observed in this region.
   Our records indicate the importance of this region at state and national
   level as an important area for bird species richness and as contact area
   of tropical bird affinity distribution in eastern Mexico to the dry
   conditions with the Mexican Plateau, as well as the presence of
   indicator bird species of good conditions of forest habitats. A greater
   research effort will allow complete knowledge of the birds in the Sierra
   Gorda in Guanajuato and be able to assess the real state of conservation
   of the bird community and populations within it. All Rights Reserved (C)

Title = {Effects of urbanization on the diversity of ant assemblages in tropical

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Urbanization has a direct effect on the landscape and its biodiversity,
   however urban centers has been ignored in most ecological studies. We
   study the diversity of ant communities in four remnants of tropical dry
   forest with different degrees of disturbance which are on the edge of
   the urban area in Quer,taro city, Mexico. Samples were collected two
   times per month, from December 2004 to December 2005, in four strata:
   leaf litter, ground, scrub and arboreal. . A total of 25 species and 23
   morphospecies were captured, belonging to 28 genera of 6 subfamilies:
   Dolichoderinae (3 species), Ecitoninae (5), Formicinae (12), Myrmicinae
   (24), Ponerinae (2) and Pseudomyrmicinae (2). Across the
   urban-disturbance gradient here studied the local diversity pattern
   could be explaining by the disturbance heterogeneity model. The most
   negative effect of urbanization was found for arboreal ants, while leaf
   litter communities were less susceptible to anthropogenic changes. In
   general, we found low rates of turnover, even in sites with high values
   of alpha diversity, evidencing the impoverishment of the ant community
   surrounding Quer,taro city and the susceptibility of the community to
   extinction. The remnants were functionally very dissimilar and the
   effects of urbanization depend largely of the diet and life history of
   individual ant species. Moreover, it was found that the soil proprieties
   and vegetation structure influenced patterns of ant diversity along the
   urban-disturbance gradient. Despite the anthropogenic disturbance of the
   tropical dry forests surrounding the city of Quer,taro, these forest
   remnants serve as a refuge for rare species and prove ecosystem
   functions. Ant biodiversity is also indicative of the state of ecosystem
   functions inside these remnants and likely of the biodiversity of other
   groups. Therefore, the conservation of these sites must be promoted to
   protect ant biodiversity and other taxonomic groups.},

Title = {The relationship of meteorological patterns with changes in floristic
   richness along a large elevational gradient in a seasonally dry region
   of southern Mexico},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Globally, climate is a fundamental driver of plant species' geographical
   distributions, yet we still lack a good understanding of climatic
   variation on tropical mountains and its consequences for elevational
   floristic patterns. In a seasonally dry region of southern Mexico, we
   analysed meteorological patterns along a large elevational gradient
   (0-3670 m a.s.l.) and examined their relationship with changes in
   floristic richness. Meteorological patterns were characterised using two
   data sources. First, climatic information was extracted from cartography
   and records from a few existing meteorological stations. Additionally,
   air temperature and humidity were recorded hourly during 1 year with
   data loggers, at sites representing 200-m elevation increments.
   Floristic information was extracted from a database containing 10,124
   records of plant collections, and organized in 200-m elevational belts.
   Climatic charts distinguished three climate types along the gradient,
   all with marked rainfall seasonality, but these bore little
   correspondence with the information obtained with the data loggers. Mean
   annual air temperature decreased with increasing elevation (lapse rate
   of 0.542 A degrees C 100 m(-1)). Thermal oscillation was minimum around
   1400 m and increased towards both extremes of the gradient. Relative
   humidity opposed this pattern, with maxima between 800 and 1800 m,
   decreasing towards the highest elevations. An analysis of temperature
   frequency distributions revealed meteorological features undetectable
   from the annual or monthly means of this variable; despite an overall
   gradual transition of the proportions of time recorded at different
   temperatures, some changes did not conform to this pattern. The first
   discontinuity occurred between 1000-1200 m, where dominant temperatures
   shifted abruptly; also noticeable was an abrupt increase of the
   proportion of time elapsed at 0.1-10 A degrees C between 2400 and 2600
   m. Air temperature appears to be the most influential climatic factor
   driving elevational variation of plant species richness in this region.},

Title = {In and out of refugia: historical patterns of diversity and demography
   in the North American Caesar's mushroom species complex},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {23},
Pages = {5938-5956},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Some of the effects of past climate dynamics on plant and animal
   diversity make-up have been relatively well studied, but to less extent
   in fungi. Pleistocene refugia are thought to harbour high biological
   diversity (i.e. phylogenetic lineages and genetic diversity), mainly as
   a product of increased reproductive isolation and allele conservation.
   In addition, high extinction rates and genetic erosion are expected in
   previously glaciated regions. Some of the consequences of past climate
   dynamics might involve changes in range and population size that can
   result in divergence and incipient or cryptic speciation. Many of these
   dynamic processes and patterns can be inferred through phylogenetic and
   coalescent methods. In this study, we first delimit species within a
   group of closely related edible ectomycorrhizal Amanita from North
   America (the American Caesar's mushrooms species complex) using
   multilocus coalescent-based approaches; and then address questions
   related to effects of Pleistocene climate change on the diversity and
   genetics of the group. Our study includes extensive geographical
   sampling throughout the distribution range, and DNA sequences from three
   nuclear protein-coding genes. Results reveal cryptic diversity and high
   speciation rates in refugia. Population sizes and expansions seem to be
   larger at midrange latitudes (Mexican highlands and SE USA). Range
   shifts are proportional to population size expansions, which were
   overall more common during the Pleistocene. This study documents
   responses to past climate change in fungi and also highlights the
   applicability of the multispecies coalescent in comparative
   phylogeographical analyses and diversity assessments that include
   ancestral species.},

Title = {Apoptotic and autophagic cell death induced by glucolaxogenin in
   cervical cancer cells},
Journal = {APOPTOSIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1623-1635},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of glucolaxogenin and its
   ability to induce apoptosis and autophagy in cervical cancer cells are
   reported. We ascertained that glucolaxogenin exerts an inhibitory effect
   on the proliferation of HeLa, CaSki and ViBo cells in a dose-dependent
   manner. Analysis of DNA distribution in the cell-cycle phase of tumor
   cells treated with glucolaxogenin suggests that the anti-proliferative
   activity of this steroid is not always dependent on the cell cycle.
   Cytotoxic activity was evaluated by detection of the lactate
   dehydrogenase enzyme in supernatants from tumor cell cultures treated
   with the steroid. Glucolaxogenin exhibited null cytotoxic activity. With
   respect to the apoptotic activity, the generation of apoptotic bodies,
   the presence of active caspase-3 and annexin-V, as well as the DNA
   fragmentation observed in all tumor lines after treatment with
   glucolaxogenin suggests that this compound does indeed induce cell death
   by apoptosis. Also, a significantly increased presence of the LC3-II,
   LC3 and Lamp-1 proteins was evidenced with the ultrastructural existence
   of autophagic vacuoles in cells treated with this steroidal glycoside,
   indicating that glucolaxogenin also induces autophagic cell death. It is
   important to note that this compound showed no cytotoxic effect and did
   not affect the proliferative capacity of mononuclear cells obtained from
   normal human peripheral blood activated by phytohaemagglutinin. Thus,
   glucolaxogenin is a compound with anti-proliferative properties that
   induces programmed cell death in cancer cell lines, though it is
   selective with respect to normal lymphocytic cells. These findings
   indicate that this glycoside could have a selective action on tumor
   cells and, therefore, be worthy of consideration as a therapeutic
   candidate with anti-tumor potential.},

Abstract = {We report experiments performed to describe the behavior of the
   experimental mass flow rate of cohesionless granular material, m(beta
   expt), through circular orifices of diameter D made on sidewalls of
   tilted bins. In such experiments, the influence of the wall thickness of
   the bin, w, and the tilt angle with respect to the vertical, beta, were
   also regarded. The experimental measurements, using beach sand and
   granulated sugar, yield a linear correlation among m(beta expt) and a
   theoretical piecewise correlation of the mass flow rate, m(beta) which
   is valid for the overall range of values of beta. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Insights from Integrative Systematics Reveal Cryptic Diversity in
   Pristimantis Frogs (Anura: Craugastoridae) from the Upper Amazon
   Basin},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Pluralistic approaches to taxonomy facilitate a more complete appraisal
   of biodiversity, especially the diversification of cryptic species.
   Although species delimitation has traditionally been based primarily on
   morphological differences, the integration of new methods allows diverse
   lines of evidence to solve the problem. Robber frogs (Pristimantis) are
   exemplary, as many of the species show high morphological variation
   within populations, but few traits that are diagnostic of species. We
   used a combination of DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes,
   morphometric data, and comparisons of ecological niche models (ENMs) to
   infer a phylogenetic hypothesis for the Pristimantis acuminatus complex.
   Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relationship between
   three new species-Pristimantis enigmaticus sp. nov., P. limoncochensis
   sp. nov. and P. omeviridis sp. nov.-originally confused with
   Pristimantis acuminatus. In combination with morphometric data and
   geographic distributions, several morphological characters such as
   degree of tympanum exposure, skin texture, ulnar/tarsal tubercles and
   sexual secondary characters (vocal slits and nuptial pads in males) were
   found to be useful for diagnosing species in the complex. Multivariate
   discriminant analyses provided a successful classification rate for
   83-100\% of specimens. Discriminant analysis of localities in
   environmental niche space showed a successful classification rate of
   75-98\%. Identity tests of ENMs rejected hypotheses of niche
   equivalency, although not strongly because the high values on niche
   overlap. Pristimantis acuminatus and P. enigmaticus sp. nov. are
   distributed along the lowlands of central-southern Ecuador and northern
   Peru, in contrast with P. limoncochensis sp. nov. and P. omeviridis sp.
   nov., which are found in northern Ecuador and southern Colombia, up to
   1200 m in the upper Amazon Basin. The methods used herein provide an
   integrated framework for inventorying the greatly underestimated
   biodiversity in Amazonia.},

Title = {Horizons and free-path distributions in quasiperiodic Lorentz gases},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},
Number = {5},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {We study the structure of quasiperiodic Lorentz gases, i.e., particles
   bouncing elastically off fixed obstacles arranged in quasiperiodic
   lattices. By employing a construction to embed such structures into a
   higher-dimensional periodic hyperlattice, we give a simple and efficient
   algorithm for numerical simulation of the dynamics of these systems.
   This same construction shows that quasiperiodic Lorentz gases
   generically exhibit a regime with infinite horizon, that is, empty
   channels through which the particles move without colliding, when the
   obstacles are small enough; in this case, the distribution of free paths
   is asymptotically a power law with exponent -3, as expected from
   infinite-horizon periodic Lorentz gases. For the critical radius at
   which these channels disappear, however, a new regime with locally
   finite horizon arises, where this distribution has an unexpected
   exponent of -5, previously observed only in a Lorentz gas formed by
   superposing three incommensurable periodic lattices in the
   Boltzmann-Grad limit where the radius of the obstacles tends to zero.},

Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},

Volume = {355},
Pages = {341-349},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The pulsed photoacoustic (PA) technique was used to study the synthesis
   by laser ablation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) in ethanol. PA
   technique allowed to determine the production rate per laser pulse and
   concentration of synthesized Ag-NPs. The samples were produced by using
   a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with 1064 nm of wavelength and 7 ns of pulse
   duration. The laser pulse energy varied from 10 to 100 mJ. Transmission
   electron microscopy micrographs demonstrated that the obtained
   nanoparticles were spherical with an average size close to 10 nm. The
   absorption spectra of the colloids showed a plasmon absorption peak
   around 400 nm. The PA analyses showed a significant reduction of the
   production rate of Ag-NPs during the first hundreds of laser pulses. For
   a higher number of pulses this rate was kept almost constant. Finally,
   we found that the root mean square (RMS) value of the PA signal was
   proportional to the laser pulse fluence on the target surface. Thus PA
   technique was useful to monitor the ablation process. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Unitary evolution and uniqueness of the Fock representation of Dirac
   fields in cosmological spacetimes},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},
Number = {10},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {We present a privileged Fock quantization of a massive Dirac field in a
   closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, partially selected by the
   criteria of invariance of the vacuum under the symmetries of the field
   equations, and unitary implementation of the dynamics. When quantizing
   free scalar fields in homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with compact
   spatial sections, these criteria have been shown to pick out a unique
   Fock representation (up to unitary equivalence). Here, we employ the
   same criteria for fermion fields and explore whether that uniqueness
   result can be extended to the case of the Fock quantization of fermions.
   For the massive Dirac field, we start by introducing a specific choice
   of the complex structure that determines the Fock representation. Such a
   structure is invariant under the symmetries of the equations of motion.
   We then prove that the corresponding representation of the canonical
   anticommutation relations admits a unitary implementation of the
   dynamics. Moreover, we construct a rather general class of
   representations that satisfy the above criteria, and we demonstrate that
   they are all unitarily equivalent to our previous choice. The complex
   structures in this class are restricted only by certain conditions on
   their asymptotic behavior for modes in the ultraviolet sector of the
   Dirac operator. We finally show that, if one assumes that these
   asymptotic conditions are in fact trivial once our criteria are
   fulfilled, then the time-dependent scaling in the definition of the
   fermionic annihilation and creationlike variables is essentially unique.},

Abstract = {Let T be a 3-partite tournament and F-3 (T) be the set of vertices of T
   not in triangles. We prove that, if the global irregularity of T, i(g)
   (T), is one and vertical bar F-3 (T)vertical bar > 3, then F-3 (T) must
   be contained in one of the partite sets of T and vertical bar
   F-3(T)vertical bar <= left perpendiculark+1/4right perpendicular + 1,
   which implies vertical bar F-3(T)vertical bar <= left
   perpendicularn+5/12right perpendicular + 1, where k is the size of the
   largest partite set and n the number of vertices of T. Moreover, we give
   some upper bounds on the number, as well as results on the structure of
   said vertices within the digraph, depending on its global irregularity.

Title = {First insights on the retroelement Rex1 in the cytogenetics of
   frogs},
Journal = {MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: While some transposable elements (TEs) have been found in
   the sequenced genomes of frog species, detailed studies of these
   elements have been lacking. In this work, we investigated the occurrence
   of the Rex1 element, which is widespread in fish, in anurans of the
   genus Physalaemus. We isolated and characterized the reverse
   transcriptase (RT)-coding sequences of Rex1 elements of five species of
   this genus.
   Results: The amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences
   of the isolated fragments allowed us to unambiguously identify regions
   corresponding to domains 3-7 of RT. Some of the nucleotide sequences
   isolated from Physlaemus ephippifer and P. albonotatus had internal
   deletions, suggesting that these fragments are likely not active TEs,
   despite being derived from a Rex1 element. When hybridized with
   metaphase chromosomes, Rex1 probes were revealed at the pericentromeric
   heterochromatic region of the short arm of chromosome 3 of the P.
   ephippifer karyotype. Neither other heterochromatin sites of the P.
   ephippifer karyotype nor any chromosomal regions of the karyotypes of P.
   albonotatus, P. spiniger and P. albifrons were detected with these
   probes.
   Conclusions: Rex1 elements were found in the genomes of five species of
   Physalaemus but clustered in only the P. ephippifer karyotype, in
   contrast to observations in some species of fish, where large
   chromosomal sites with Rex1 elements are typically present.},

Title = {Short-day photoperiod disrupts daily activity and facilitates

Abstract = {Seasonal photoperiod has impact on the physiology of many plants and
   animals. Short days related with the winter are often associated with
   changes in activity patterns and, in humans, with some mood disorders.
   Natural changes related with seasonality occur gradually and such
   approach has to be considered when studying animal models in laboratory
   conditions. In the present work, we studied if gradual changes from
   light-dark cycles 12:12h to short (08:16) or long days (16:08) have a
   significant effect upon the locomotor activity profile and some anxiety-
   and depression-like behaviours in the gerbil Meriones unguiculatus.
   Locomotor activity was recorded by means of infrared light beams. Once
   adapted to experimental photoperiod, gerbils were used for elevated plus
   maze (EPM) or forced swim test (FST). Our results indicate that in
   12:12, a clear bimodal pattern associated with light transitions was
   present. When exposed to long days, gerbils increased their total
   locomotor activity and the bimodal profile persisted. When in short
   days, locomotor activity decreased and no rhythm was noted. Behavioural
   assays on EPM and FST indicated that exposition to short days induce in
   the gerbils an anxiety and depressive-like behaviour, reducing the time
   spent in open arms and increasing the time of immobilizations. We
   conclude that short photoperiod affects negatively the locomotor
   activity daily patterns and mood behaviour in anxiety and depressive way
   in the Mongolian gerbil.},

Abstract = {Magnetic fields appear everywhere in the Universe. Their widespread
   presence at high redshifts and very large scales suggests that their
   origin could be primordial. In particular, their presence during the
   inflationary epoch can certainly not be ruled out. In the warm inflation
   scenario, the coupling of the inflaton to other bosonic and fermionic
   fields gives rise to dissipative effects that modify the inflationary
   dynamics. Since primordial magnetic fields could have an effect on both
   the effective inflationary potential and the inflaton decay process,
   their contribution must be considered together with the finite
   temperature corrections. We review here their effect on the inflationary
   potential and present preliminary results of their intervention in the
   dissipation process. ((c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {The causes underlying the self-perpetuating nature of idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and usually lethal disease,
   remain unknown. We hypothesised that alveolar soluble annexin V
   contributes to lung fibrosis, based on the observation that human IPF
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) containing high annexin V levels
   promoted fibroblast involvement in alveolar epithelial wound healing
   that was reduced when annexin V was depleted from the BALF.
   Conditioned medium from annexin V-treated alveolar epithelial type 2
   cells (AEC2), but not annexin V per se, induced proliferation of human
   fibroblasts and contained pro-fibrotic, IPF-associated proteins, as well
   as pro-inflammatory cytokines that were found to correlate tightly
   (r>0.95) with annexin V levels in human BALF. ErbB2 receptor tyrosine
   kinase in AECs was activated by annexin V, and blockade reduced the
   fibrotic potential of annexin V-treated AEC-conditioned medium. In vivo,
   aerosol delivery of annexin V to mouse lung induced inflammation,
   fibrosis and increased hydroxyproline, with activation of Wnt,
   transforming growth factor-beta, mitogen-activated protein kinase and
   nuclear factor-kappa B signalling pathways, as seen in IPF.
   Chronically increased alveolar annexin V levels, as reflected in
   increased IPF BALF levels, may contribute to the progression of IPF by
   inducing the release of pro-fibrotic mediators.},

Abstract = {Euphorbia dioeca Kunth belongs to the Wanderer's herb complex that is
   traditionally used for skin diseases and recently as antidiabetic. The
   methanol and aqueous extracts were evaluated for their in vitro
   gamma-glucosidase inhibitory activity and an oral starch tolerance test.
   These extracts showed an IC50 of 0.55 and 0.85 mg/mL, respectively. In
   diabetic Long Evans rats, the methanol and aqueous extracts reduced
   significantly the postprandial hyperglycemia peak in 15.2\% and 12.8\%,
   respectively. The gamma-glucosidase inhibitory activity is related with
   the presence of glycosides, phenolic compounds and flavonoids.
   Additionally, the safety parameters of both extracts were assessed by
   means of an acute toxicity test, being classified as innocuous. The
   traditional use of E. dioeca to control type 2 diabetes was confirmed,
   being an important source of gamma-glucosidase inhibitors.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe the flow of a predator prey model where the
   predator feeds on two age classes of prey. Some basic features of the
   flow are proved under very mild hypothesis on the functional responses.
   To study the relationship between the ecological parameters and the
   behavioral ones, we also analyze a special case of the model where
   modified versions of the Holling type II functional responses are
   considered to take into account both a certain interference of the age
   classes of the prey on the predator activity and a defense mechanism of
   the juvenile class of the prey. Indeed, we find that independently of
   the profit that each one of the prey age class provides to the predator,
   the coexistence of the predator and the prey populations is only
   possible for a bounded range of the carrying capacity due to the joint
   action of the defense mechanism and the interference of the prey and the
   age. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We study the correlation properties of word lengths in large texts from
   30 ebooks in the English language from the Gutenberg Project
   (www.gutenberg.org) using the natural visibility graph method (NVG). NVG
   converts a time series into a graph and then analyzes its graph
   properties. First, the original sequence of words is transformed into a
   sequence of values containing the length of each word, and then, it is
   integrated. Next, we apply the NVG to the integrated word-length series
   and construct the network. We show that the degree distribution of that
   network follows a power law, with two regimes, which are characterized
   by the exponents (at short degree scales) (at large degree scales). This
   suggests that word lengths are much more strongly correlated at large
   distances between words than at short distances between words. That
   finding is also supported by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)
   and recurrence time distribution. These results provide new information
   about the universal characteristics of the structure of written texts
   beyond that given by word frequencies.},

Title = {Speciation genomics and a role for the Z chromosome in the early stages

Abstract = {Speciation is a continuous and dynamic process, and studying organisms
   during the early stages of this process can aid in identifying
   speciation mechanisms. The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Mexican duck
   (A. {[}p.] diazi) are two recently diverged taxa with a history of
   hybridization and controversial taxonomy. To understand their
   evolutionary history, we conducted genomic scans to characterize
   patterns of genetic diversity and divergence across the mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) control region, 3523 autosomal loci and 172 Z-linked sex
   chromosome loci. Between the two taxa, Z-linked loci (Phi(ST) = 0.088)
   were 5.2 times more differentiated than autosomal DNA (Phi(ST) = 0.017)
   but comparable to mtDNA (Phi(ST) = 0.092). This elevated Z
   differentiation deviated from neutral expectations inferred from
   simulated data that incorporated demographic history and differences in
   effective population sizes between marker types. Furthermore, 3\% of
   Z-linked loci, compared to <0.1\% of autosomal loci, were detected as
   outlier loci under divergent selection with elevated relative (Phi(ST))
   and absolute (d(XY)) estimates of divergence. In contrast, the ratio of
   Z-linked and autosomal differentiation among the seven Mexican duck
   sampling locations was close to 1:1 (Phi(ST) = 0.018 for both markers).
   We conclude that between mallards and Mexican ducks, divergence at
   autosomal markers is largely neutral, whereas greater divergence on the
   Z chromosome (or some portions thereof) is likely the product of
   selection that has been important in speciation. Our results contribute
   to a growing body of literature indicating elevated divergence on the Z
   chromosome and its likely importance in avian speciation.},

   Corrections for Inferring SNP Phylogenies},

Abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are useful markers for
   phylogenetic studies owing in part to their ubiquity throughout the
   genome and ease of collection. Restriction site associated DNA
   sequencing (RADseq) methods are becoming increasingly popular for SNP
   data collection, but an assessment of the best practises for using these
   data in phylogenetics is lacking. We use computer simulations, and new
   double digest RADseq (ddRADseq) data for the lizard family
   Phrynosomatidae, to investigate the accuracy of RAD loci for
   phylogenetic inference. We compare the two primary ways RAD loci are
   used during phylogenetic analysis, including the analysis of full
   sequences (i.e., SNPs together with invariant sites), or the analysis of
   SNPs on their own after excluding invariant sites. We find that using
   full sequences rather than just SNPs is preferable from the perspectives
   of branch length and topological accuracy, but not of computational
   time. We introduce two new acquisition bias corrections for dealing with
   alignments composed exclusively of SNPs, a conditional likelihood method
   and a reconstituted DNA approach. The conditional likelihood method
   conditions on the presence of variable characters only (the number of
   invariant sites that are unsampled but known to exist is not
   considered), while the reconstituted DNA approach requires the user to
   specify the exact number of unsampled invariant sites prior to the
   analysis. Under simulation, branch length biases increase with the
   amount of missing data for both acquisition bias correction methods, but
   branch length accuracy is much improved in the reconstituted DNA
   approach compared to the conditional likelihood approach. Phylogenetic
   analyses of the empirical data using concatenation or a coalescent-based
   species tree approach provide strong support for many of the accepted
   relationships among phrynosomatid lizards, suggesting that RAD loci
   contain useful phylogenetic signal across a range of divergence times
   despite the presence of missing data. Phylogenetic analysis of RAD loci
   requires careful attention to model assumptions, especially if
   downstream analyses depend on branch lengths.},

Abstract = {Cellular adhesion enables communication between cells and their
   environment. Adhesion can be achieved throughout focal adhesions and its
   components influence osteoblast differentiation of human mesenchymal
   stem cells (hMSCs). Because cell adhesion and osteoblast differentiation
   are closely related, this article aimed to analyze the expression
   profiles of adhesion-related proteins during osteoblastic
   differentiation of two hMSCs subpopulations (CD105(+) and CD105(-)) and
   propose a strategy for assembling bone grafts based on its adhesion
   ability. In vitro experiments of osteogenic differentiation in CD105(-)
   cells showed superior adhesion efficiency and 2-fold increase of
   -actinin expression compared with CD105(+) cells at the maturation
   stage. Interestingly, levels of activated 1-integrin increased in
   CD105(-) cells during the process. Additionally, the CD105(-)
   subpopulation showed 3-fold increase of phosphorylated FAK(Y397)
   compared to CD105(+) cells. Results also indicate that ERK1/2 was
   activated during CD105(-) bone differentiation and participation of
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-p38 in CD105(+) differentiation
   through a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-independent pathway. In vivo trial
   demonstrated that grafts containing CD105(-) showed osteocytes embedded
   in a mineralized matrix, promoted adequate graft integration, increased
   host vascular infiltration, and efficient intramembranous repairing. In
   contrast, grafts containing CD105(+) showed deficient endochondral
   ossification and fibrocartilaginous tissue. Based on the expression of
   -actinin, FAKy,(397) and ERK1/2 activation, we define maturation stage
   as critical for bone graft assembling. By in vitro assays, CD105(-)
   subpopulation showed superior adhesion efficiency compared to CD105(+)
   cells. Considering in vitro and in vivo assays, this study suggests that
   integration of a scaffold with CD105(-) subpopulation at the maturation
   stage represents an attractive strategy for clinical use in orthopedic
   bioengineering.},

Abstract = {Background: The importance of prebiotics consumption is increasing all
   over the world due to their beneficial effects on health. Production of
   better prebiotics from endemic plants raises possibilities to enhance
   nutritional effects in vulnerable population groups. Fructans derived
   from Agave Plant have demonstrated their safety and efficacy as
   prebiotics in animal models. Recently, the safety in humans of two
   fructans obtained from Agave tequilana (Metlin((R)) and Metlos((R))) was
   demonstrated. Methods: This study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy as
   prebiotics of Metlin((R)) and Metlos((R)) in newborns of a randomized,
   double blind, controlled trial with a pilot study design. Biological
   samples were taken at 20 +/- 7 days, and three months of age from
   healthy babies. Outcomes of efficacy include impact on immune response,
   serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, bone metabolism, and gut bacteria
   changes. Results: There were differences statistically significant for
   the groups of infants fed only with infant formula and with formula
   enriched with Metlin((R)) and Metlos((R)). Conclusions: Our results
   support the efficacy of Metlin((R)) and Metlos((R)) as prebiotics in
   humans, and stand the bases to recommend their consumption. Trial

Title = {Phylogeny of frogs from the genus Physalaemus (Anura,

Abstract = {Although some species groups have been recognized in the leiuperine
   genus Physalaemus, no phylogenetic analysis has previously been
   performed. Here, we provide a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial
   and nuclear DNA sequences from 41 of the 46 species of Physalaemus. We
   employed the parsimony criterion using the software TNT and POY and the
   Bayesian criterion using the software MrBayes. Two major clades were
   recovered inside the monophyletic Physalaemus: (i) the highly supported
   Physalaemus signifer Clade, which included P. nattereri and the species
   previously placed in the P. deimaticus and P. signifer Groups; and (ii)
   the Physalaemus cuvieri Clade, which included the remaining species of
   Physalaemus. Five species groups were recognized in the P. cuvieri
   Clade: the P. biligonigerus Group, the P. cuvieri Group, the P. henselii
   Group, the P. gracilis Group and the P. olfersii Group. The P. gracilis
   Species Group was the same as that previously proposed by Nascimento et
   al. (2005). The P. henselii Group includes P. fernandezae and P.
   henselii, and was the sister group of a clade that comprised the
   remaining species of the P. cuvieri Clade. The P. olfersii Group
   included P. olfersii, P. soaresi, P. maximus, P. feioi and P.
   lateristriga. The P. biligonigerus Species Group was composed of P.
   biligonigerus, P. marmoratus, P. santafecinus and P. riograndensis. The
   P. cuvieri Group inferred here differed from that recognized by
   Nascimento et al. (2005) only by the inclusion of P. albifrons and the
   exclusion of P. cicada. The paraphyly of P. cuvieri with respect to P.
   ephippifer was inferred in all the analyses. Distinct genetic lineages
   were recognized among individuals currently identified as P. cuvieri and
   they were congruent with cytogenetic differences reported previously,
   supporting the hypothesis of occurrence of formally unnamed species. (C)

Abstract = {Amphibians are undergoing a global conservation crisis, and they are one
   of the most underrepresented groups of vertebrates in the global network
   of protected areas (PM). In this study, we evaluated the ability of the
   world's PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the
   magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of
   gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs).
   Twenty-four percent of species (n = 1535) are totally unrepresented, and
   another 18\% (n = 1119) have less than 5\% of their distribution inside
   PM. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000 km(2) do not occur
   inside any PA Furthermore, more than 65\% of the distribution of gap
   species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth's PM have
   greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected
   amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should
   strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive
   conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and
   management of PM, given amphibians' extinction risk and ability to act
   as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for
   threatened amphibian species; and (3) the-need for increased funding for
   scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species.
   Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher
   priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a
   precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several
   challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation
   strategies and opportunities in the next decade. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {There is a need to develop indicators of mangrove condition using
   remotely sensed data. However, remote estimation of leaf and canopy
   biochemical properties and vegetation condition remains challenging. In
   this paper, we (i) tested the performance of selected hyperspectral and
   broad band indices to predict chlorophyll concentration (CC) on mangrove
   leaves and (ii) showed the potential of Landsat 8 for estimation of
   mangrove CC at the landscape level. Relative leaf CC and leaf spectral
   response were measured at 12 Elementary Sampling Units (ESU) distributed
   along the northwest coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Linear
   regression models and coefficients of determination were computed to
   measure the association between CC and spectral response. At leaf level,
   the narrow band indices with the largest correlation with CC were
   Vogelmann indices and the MTCI (R2> 0.5). Indices with spectral bands
   around the red edge (705-753 nm) were more sensitive to mangrove leaf
   CC. At the ESU level Landsat 8 NDVI green, which uses the green band in
   its formulation explained most of the variation in CC (R-2 > 0.8).
   Accuracy assessment between estimated CC and observed CC using the
   leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method yielded a root mean
   squared error (RMSE) = 15 mu g center dot cm(-2), and R2 = 0.703. CC
   maps showing the spatiotemporal variation of CC at landscape scale were
   created using the linear model. Our results indicate that Landsat 8 NDVI
   green can be employed to estimate CC in large mangrove areas where
   ground networks cannot be applied, and mapping techniques based on
   satellite data, are necessary. Furthermore, using upcoming technologies
   that will include two bands around the red edge such as Sentinel 2 will
   improve mangrove monitoring at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.},

Abstract = {Aim Tropical forests store 25\% of global carbon and harbour 96\% of the
   world's tree species, but it is not clear whether this high biodiversity
   matters for carbon storage. Few studies have teased apart the relative
   importance of forest attributes and environmental drivers for ecosystem
   functioning, and no such study exists for the tropics.
   Location Neotropics.
   Methods We relate aboveground biomass (AGB) to forest attributes
   (diversity and structure) and environmental drivers (annual rainfall and
   soil fertility) using data from 144,000 trees, 2050 forest plots and 59
   forest sites. The sites span the complete latitudinal and climatic
   gradients in the lowland Neotropics, with rainfall ranging from 750 to
   4350mmyear(-1). Relationships were analysed within forest sites at
   scales of 0.1 and 1 ha and across forest sites along large-scale
   environmental gradients. We used a structural equation model to test the
   hypothesis that species richness, forest structural attributes and
   environmental drivers have independent, positive effects on AGB.
   Results Across sites, AGB was most strongly driven by rainfall, followed
   by average tree stem diameter and rarefied species richness, which all
   had positive effects on AGB. Our indicator of soil fertility (cation
   exchange capacity) had a negligible effect on AGB, perhaps because we
   used a global soil database. Taxonomic forest attributes (i.e. species
   richness, rarefied richness and Shannon diversity) had the strongest
   relationships with AGB at small spatial scales, where an additional
   species can still make a difference in terms of niche complementarity,
   while structural forest attributes (i.e. tree density and tree size) had
   strong relationships with AGB at all spatial scales.
   Main conclusions Biodiversity has an independent, positive effect on AGB
   and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate
   systems but also in structurally complex hyperdiverse tropical forests.
   Biodiversity conservation should therefore be a key component of the UN
   Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation strategy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we find analytically the first order solutions of the
   Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian with degenerated
   single-electron energy levels. The results are compared to the
   Richardson exact solutions calculated numerically, showing good
   agreement in the weak interaction limit. Using this first-order
   solution, we further calculate the number of pairs at the ground state
   as a function of temperature. In particular, the Bose-Einstein
   condensation (BEC) temperature is found when the population of
   ground-state pairs starts growing. This study provides a BEC analysis of
   the superconductivity for weak coupling regime, which traditionally
   belongs to the BCS side of the BCS-BEC crossover picture. (C) 2015

Title = {Evidence of duplicated Hox genes in the most recent common ancestor of
   extant scorpions},

Abstract = {Scorpions (order Scorpiones) are unusual among arthropods, both for the
   extreme heteronomy of their bauplan and for the high gene family
   turnover exhibited in their genomes. These phenomena appear to be
   correlated, as two scorpion species have been shown to possess nearly
   twice the number of Hox genes present in most arthropods. Segmentally
   offset anterior expression boundaries of a subset of Hox paralogs have
   been shown to correspond to transitions in segmental identities in the
   scorpion posterior tagmata, suggesting that posterior heteronomy in
   scorpions may have been achieved by neofunctionalization of Hox
   paralogs. However, both the first scorpion genome sequenced and the
   developmental genetic data are based on exemplars of Buthidae, one of 19
   families of scorpions. It is therefore not known whether Hox paralogy is
   limited to Buthidae or widespread among scorpions. We surveyed 24 high
   throughput transcriptomes and the single whole genome available for
   scorpions, in order to test the prediction that Hox gene duplications
   are common to the order. We used gene tree parsimony to infer whether
   the paralogy was consistent with a duplication event in the scorpion
   common ancestor. Here we show that duplicated Hox genes in non-buthid
   scorpions occur in six of the ten Hox classes. Gene tree topologies and
   parsimony-based reconciliation of the gene trees are consistent with a
   duplication event in the most recent common ancestor of scorpions. These
   results suggest that a Hox paralogy, and by extension the model of
   posterior patterning established in a buthid, can be extended to
   non-Buthidae scorpions.},

Abstract = {The present research showed, for the 1st time, the effect of formulated
   diets for broodstock of Octopus maya. Reproductive response of O. maya
   females fed prepared diets and a control diet (crab) was evaluated
   according to reproductive performance and hatchling quality. Females
   were fed three formulated most diets based on: 1) crab and squid (CS),
   2) crab, squid and fish heads (CSF) and 3) crab, squid and SELCO (R)
   (CSS). Fresh crab (Callinectes sapidus) (Diet 4, C) was used as a
   control diet. A total of 10 females were used for each experimental diet
   (n= 40). Females were fed 5\% body weight d(-1) until spawning. The
   feeding period of females was 50 days on average to natural spawning (p
   < 0.05). Eggs laid by each female were placed in separate incubators
   with similar temperature, light and water quality, which were thoroughly
   controlled. Total egg number, egg batches, fecundity, spawning, newly
   hatched weight and survival after 10 days unfed were determined for each
   spawn. Egg and hatchling biochemical composition, as well as soluble
   protein content from the perivitelline was determined for each spawn.
   Embryonic development of eggs was also studied. No differences in
   reproductive performance were observed between the four diets. Contrary,
   PCO analysis showed marked differences on fatty acid composition of the
   yolk and hatchlings. Palmitic acid (16:0) and arachidonic acid (20:4n6)
   were the main contributors for the first coordinate (eigenvalues, lambda
   of 0.54 and 0.55 for embryo and hatchlings yolk, respectively). Females
   fed the control diet (C) produced hatchling with higher weight (p <
   0.05). Diet 3 (CSS) delivered the largest hatchlings (p < 0.05) among
   the prepared diets. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in soluble
   protein content of the perivitelline or newly hatched survival after 10
   days unfed. Morphometric differences on 40 days old embryos were
   associated with females (p < 0.05) but not with each diet (p > 0.05).
   Results obtained indicate that O. maya female's present marked
   adaptation to the diets ingested prior to egg laying, without
   compromising reproductive performance. Statement of relevance Advances

Abstract = {Salmea scandens (L.) DC is an indigenous edible plant whose stem bark is
   traditionally used as food by people of Oaxaca, Mexico. Proximate
   analysis of the edible stem bark revealed abundant amounts of fiber
   (43.67\%) and protein (9.27\%). GC and GC-MS analyses demonstrated that
   the essential oil from leaves contained high levels of germacrene D
   (47.1\%) and elemol (15.3\%), whereas that of the stem bark contained
   the alkylamides N-Isobutyl-(2E,4E,8Z,10E/Z)-dodecatetraenamide isomers
   (39.7\%). Levels of these compounds in the essential oil from both
   organs were in similar concentrations in all seasons except winter. The
   HPLC purified N-Isobutyl-(2E,4E,8Z,10E/Z)-dodecatetraenamide isomers
   produced a noncompetitive inhibition on porcine pancreatic lipase. The
   enzymatic assays with these compounds revealed a modification on V-max
   (0.0431-0.0533 mM min(-1)) whereas the K-m value (0.880-0.881 mM) was
   not significantly changed. Essential oil from the stem bark showed a
   high anti-microbial activity against some phytopathogenic
   microorganisms. The MIC's in mu g mL(-1) for Pseudomonas syringae
   pathovars were tabaci 56.1, tomato 91.2 and phaseolitica 196.4, for
   Clavibacter michiganensis 35.8 and Erwinia carotovora 48.1. The fungi
   Fusarium oxysporum and Phytophthora infestans had MIC's in mu g mL(-1)
   of 3.3 and 2.4 respectively. Same essential oil was highly effective
   against larvae from Aedes aegypti (LC50 = 0.3 mu g mL(-l)) and Anopheles
   albimanis (LC50 = 2.5 mu g mL(-1)). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The Rufous-backed Robin (Turdus rufopalliatus) is endemic to deciduous
   and semideciduous tropical forests of western Mexico. Of the currently
   recognized subspecies, T. r. graysoni, from the Tres Marias Islands and
   nearby coastal Nayarit, has been considered a separate species; however,
   this treatment has been challenged due to an apparent contact zone on
   the mainland, although no hybrids have ever been recorded. Here, we use
   mitochondrial DNA sequences from individuals sampled across the species'
   range to assess their phylogeographic relationships. We found reciprocal
   monophyly between Tres Marias Islands and mainland populations, which
   share no haplotypes between them. Evolutionary divergence detected
   within T. rufopalliatus suggests that mainland and island populations
   have been isolated from each other, and divergence decreases if insular
   populations are excluded. Demographic parameters suggest that
   populations are in the process of a rapid expansion from ancestral
   populations with a lower population size. These results are consistent
   with morphometric and plumage differences that have been used to
   recognize the Tres Marias Islands populations from the mainland ones,
   thus suggesting species status of the island form.},

Abstract = {We have constructed a counterpropagating optical tweezers setup embedded
   in a Sagnac interferometer in order to increase the sensitivity of
   position tracking for particles in the geometrical optics regime.
   Enhanced position determination using a Sagnac interferometer has
   previously been described theoretically by Taylor et al. {[}Journal of
   Optics 13, 044014 (2011)] for Rayleigh-regime particles trapped in an
   antinode of a standing wave. We have extended their theory to a case of
   arbitrarily-sized particles trapped with orthogonally-polarized
   counterpropagating beams. The working distance of the setup was
   sufficiently long to optically induce particle oscillations orthogonally
   to the axis of the tweezers with an auxiliary laser beam. Using these
   oscillations as a reference, we have experimentally shown that
   Sagnac-enhanced back focal plane interferometry is capable of providing
   an improvement of more than 5 times in the signal-to-background ratio,
   corresponding to a more than 30-fold improvement of the signal-to-noise
   ratio. The experimental results obtained are consistent with our
   theoretical predictions. In the experimental setup, we used a method of
   optical levitator-assisted liquid droplet delivery in air based on
   commercial inkjet technology, with a novel method to precisely control
   the size of droplets. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America},

Title = {Pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in the decasilanaphthalene molecule: Towards
   the origin of the buckling in silicene},
Journal = {CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {460},
Pages = {97-100},
Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {It has been theoretically predicted that the ground state of
   free-standing silicene has a periodic buckled structure, whose origin is
   attributed to the puckering distortion on the individual six-member
   rings. In this work we present a theoretical analysis of the vibronic
   instability of the ground state of two hexagonal silicene units
   (decasilanaphthalene molecule) of D2h planar symmetry to the 3D puckered
   structure with C-2h symmetry. Both, the multilevel superposition
   vibronic model and possible mixing of excited states of different
   irreducible representations are studied. We show that contrary to the
   one six-member ring case, for the decasilanaphthalene molecule, the
   multilevel PJT does not provide a satisfactory explanation for puckering
   and a proper description is given by a ground state coupling with two
   quasi-degenerate excited states. Hence a simple extrapolation of the
   origin of the puckering distortion in silicene from one to n-hexagonal
   components is not straightforward. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The formation of cholesterol gallstones involves very complex
   imbalances, such as alterations in the secretion of biliary lipids
   (which involves the ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCB4 and ABCB11 transporters),
   biochemical and immunological reactions in the gallbladder that produce
   biliary sludge (mucins), physicochemical changes in the structure of
   cholesterol (crystallization), alterations in gallbladder motility,
   changes in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol (ABCG5/8
   transporters and Niemann-Pick C1L1 protein) and alterations in small
   intestine motility. Some of these proteins have been studied at the
   clinical and experimental levels, but more research is required. In this
   review, we discuss the results of studies on some molecules involved in
   the pathophysiology of gallstones that may be future therapeutic targets
   to prevent the development of this disease, and possible sites for
   treatment based mainly on the absorption of intestinal cholesterol
   (Niemann-Pick C1L1 and ABCG5/8 proteins). (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {475},
Pages = {140-147},

Abstract = {Using sib initio molecular dynamics and a new approach based on the
   undernielt-quench method we generated amorphous and liquid samples of
   Cu,Zrjoo, (x=64, 50, 36) alloys. We characterized the topology of our
   resulting structures by means of the pair distribution function and the
   bond-angle distribution; a coordination number distribution was also
   calculated. Our results for both amorphous and liquids agree well with
   experiment. Dependence of short-range order with the concentration is
   reported. We found that icosahedron-like geometry plays a major role
   whenever the alloys are Cu-rich or Zr-rich disregarding if the samples
   are amorphous or liquid. The validation of these results, in turn would
   let us calculate other properties so far disregarded in the literature.

Title = {High proportion of cactus species threatened with extinction},
Journal = {NATURE PLANTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {A high proportion of plant species is predicted to be threatened with
   extinction in the near future. However, the threat status of only a
   small number has been evaluated compared with key animal groups,
   rendering the magnitude and nature of the risks plants face unclear.
   Here we report the results of a global species assessment for the
   largest plant taxon evaluated to date under the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Categories and Criteria, the
   iconic Cactaceae (cacti). We show that cacti are among the most
   threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date, with 31\% of the 1,478
   evaluated species threatened, demonstrating the high anthropogenic
   pressures on biodiversity in arid lands. The distribution of threatened
   species and the predominant threatening processes and drivers are
   different to those described for other taxa. The most significant threat
   processes comprise land conversion to agriculture and aquaculture,
   collection as biological resources, and residential and commercial
   development. The dominant drivers of extinction risk are the
   unscrupulous collection of live plants and seeds for horticultural trade
   and private ornamental collections, smallholder livestock ranching and
   smallholder annual agriculture. Our findings demonstrate that global
   species assessments are readily achievable for major groups of plants
   with relatively moderate resources, and highlight different conservation
   priorities and actions to those derived from species assessments of key
   animal groups.},

Abstract = {The administration of dopaminergic drugs produces analgesia in
   individuals experiencing different types of pain. Analgesia induced by
   these drugs at the spinal cord level is mediated by D2-like agonists,
   which specifically inhibit the detection of nociceptive stimuli by
   sensory afferents. The extent of the analgesia provided by spinal
   dopamine agonists remains controversial, and the cellular mechanism of
   this analgesic process is poorly understood. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the analgesic effect of quinpirole, a D2-like agonist,
   based on two nociceptive tests and at various doses that were selected
   to specifically activate dopamine receptors. We found that intrathecal
   quinpirole administration produces analgesia of mechanical but not
   thermal nociception and that the analgesic effect of quinpirole is
   reversed by a mix of D2, D3, and D4 receptor-specific antagonists,
   suggesting that the activation of all D2-like receptors is involved in
   the analgesia produced by intrathecal quinpirole. The differential
   effect on thermal and mechanical nociception was also tested upon the
   activation of g-opioid receptors. As reported previously, low doses of
   the g-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO produced analgesia of only
   thermonociception. This evidence shows that a D2-like receptor agonist
   administered at the spinal cord level produces analgesia specific to
   mechanonociception but not thermonociception. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Decolorization of Kraft liquor effluents and biochemical
   characterization of laccases from Phlebia brevispora BAFC 633},

Abstract = {In this work we evaluated the decolorization ability of fungus
   identified as Phlebia brevispora BAFC 633 on Kraft liquor effluents and
   we looked at the biochemical characterization of two novel laccases from
   the fungus. We conducted decolorization assays on diluted Kraft liquor
   with the enzyme supernatants. Ligninolytic activity was demonstrated by
   the 20\% reduction of lignin peak absorbances between 215 and 280 nm
   after laccase supernatants treatment.
   From these supernatants, two novel laccases were isolated and
   characterized: a constitutively expressed 60-kDa (Lac A), and a
   CuSO4-induced 75 kDa (Lac B). Laccases were purified by anion-exchange
   and gel filltration chromatography and their biochemical properties were
   determined. The temperature and pH optima were 70-75 degrees C and 4.8
   for Lac A, and 60-70 degrees C and 4.4 for Lac B; and both exhibited
   high stability at low pH and high temperature. Substrate specificity of
   the purified enzyme was tested and the highest oxidation was to
   2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) with a catalytic
   efficiency of 2.6 x 10(7) s(-1) mol l(-1) for Lac A and 9 x 10(8) s(-1)
   mol l(-1) for Lac B.
   Enzyme supernatants can be used to remediate lignin-rich effluent. The
   isoenzymes tolerance to low pH and high temperature are significant
   features to optimize laccase production toward potential
   biotechnological applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Endosymbiosis is a common phenomenon in nature, especially between
   bacteria and insects, whose typically unbalanced diets are
   usuallycomplementedby theirobligateendosymbionts.
   Whilemuchinterestandfocus hasbeendirected toward phloem-feeders like
   aphids andmealybugs, blood-feeders such as the Lone star tick (Amblyomma
   americanum), Glossina flies, and the human body louse (Pediculus humanus
   corporis) depend on obligate endosymbionts which complement their
   B-vitamin-deficient diets, and thus are required for growth and
   survival. Glossiphoniid leeches have also been found to harbor distinct
   endosymbionts housed in specialized organs. Here, we present the genome
   of the bacterial endosymbiont from Haementeria officinalis, first of a
   glossiphoniid leech. This as-yet-unnamedendosymbiont belongs to
   theGammaproteobacteria, has apleomorphic shape and is restricted to
   bacteriocytes. For this bacterialendosymbiont, wepropose
   thenameCandidatus Providencia siddallii. This symbiont possessesa highly
   reducedgenome with high A + T content and a reduced set of metabolic
   capabilities, all of which are common characteristics of ancient
   obligate endosymbionts of arthropods. Its genome has retainedmany
   pathways related to the biosynthesis of B-vitamins, pointing toward a
   role in supplementing the blood-restricted diet of its host. Through
   comparative genomics against the endosymbionts of A. americanum,
   Glossina flies, and P. humanus corporis, wewere able to detect a high
   degree ofmetabolic convergence among these four very distantly related
   endosymbiotic bacteria.},

Abstract = {In this work we define a new pseudometric in K-{*}(n), the hyperspace of
   all non-degenerated compact convex sets of]R-n, which is invariant under
   similarities. We will prove that the quotient space generated by this
   pseudometric (which is the orbit space generated by the natural action
   of the group of similarities on K-{*}(n)) is homeomorphic to the
   Banach-Mazur compactum BM(n), while K-{*}(n) is homeomorphic to the
   topological product Q X Rn+1, where Q stands for the Hilbert cube.
   Finally we will show some consequences in convex geometry, namely, we
   measure how much two convex bodies differ (by means of our new
   pseudometric) in terms of some classical functionals. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The dynamic and thermodynamic properties of nanoclusters are studied in
   two different environments: the canonical and microcanonical ensembles.
   A comparison is made to thermodynamic properties of the bulk. It is
   shown that consistent and reproducible results on nanoclusters can only
   be obtained in the canonical ensemble. Nanoclusters in the
   microcanonical ensemble are trapped systems, and inconsistencies will be
   found if thermodynamic formalism is applied. An analytical model is
   given for the energy dependence of the phase space volume of
   nanoclusters, which allows the prediction of both dynamical and
   thermodynamical properties.},

Abstract = {On the Yucatan Peninsula there is an upwelling which allows access to a
   body of cold water that controls temperature in this area. This
   modulates the ecology and distribution of organisms that inhabit the
   continental shelf. The objective of this study was to determine the
   effect of different acclimation temperatures on the thermal biology of
   prey as mollusc, crustacean (Melongena corona bispinosa, Strombus
   pugilis, Callinectes similis, Libinia dubia) and predators as fish
   (Ocyurus chlysurus, Centropomus undecimalis) of Octopus maya. Octopus
   prey preferred temperatures between 23.5 degrees C and 26.0 degrees C,
   while predators preferred temperatures 26.4-28.5 degrees C. The species
   with largest thermal windows were M. corona bispinosa (328.8 degrees
   C-2), C simi/is (322.8 degrees C-2), L. dubia (319.2 degrees C-2), C.
   undecimalis (288.6 degrees C-2), 0. chrysurus (237.5 degrees C-2), while
   the smallest thermal window was for S. pugilis (202.0 degrees C-2). The
   acclimation response ratios (ARR)-estimated for prey ranged from
   0.24-0.55 in animals exposed to CTMax and 0.21-0.65 in those exposed to
   CTMin. Amongst predators, ARR ranged from 0.30 to 0.60 and 0.41 to 0.53
   for animals exposed to CTMax and CTMin, respectively. Correlating the
   optimal temperature limits of prey and predators with surface
   temperatures on the continental shelf and those 4 m deep showed that the
   main prey, Callinectes similis and L dubia, shared a thermal niche and
   that an increase in temperature could force these species to migrate to
   other sites to find optimal temperatures for their physiological
   functions. As a consequence the continental shelf community would
   undergo a structural change. Predators were found to be near their
   optimal temperatures in surface temperatures on the continental shelf.
   We conclude that they would remain in the area in a warming scenario.
   The size of the thermal window was related to the type of ecosystem
   inhabited by these species. These ARR intervals allowed us to categorize
   the species as temperate or tropical, according to the oceanographic
   conditions that prevail on the Yucatan Peninsula. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {93-103},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Motivated by the experimental evidences accumulated in the last ten
   years and based on information deposited in RegulonDB, literature look
   up, and sequence analysis, we analyze the repertoire of 304 DNA-binding
   Transcription factors (TFs) in Escherichia coli K-12. These regulators
   were grouped in 78 evolutionary families and are regulating almost half
   of the total genes in this bacterium. In structural terms, 60\% of TFs
   are composed by two-domains, 30\% are monodomain, and 10\% three- and
   four-structural domains. As previously noticed, the most abundant
   DNA-binding domain corresponds to the winged helix-turn-helix, with few
   alternative DNA-binding structures, resembling the hypothesis of
   successful protein structures with the emergence of new ones at low
   scales. In summary, we identified and described the characteristics
   associated to the DNA-binding TF in E. coli K-12. We also identified
   twelve functional modules based on a co-regulated gene matrix. Finally,
   diverse regulons were predicted based on direct associations between the
   TFs and potential regulated genes. This analysis should increase our
   knowledge about the gene regulation in the bacterium E. coli K-12, and
   provide more additional clues for comprehensive modelling of
   transcriptional regulatory networks in other bacteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Distribution of putative xenogeneic silencers in prokaryote genomes},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {167-172},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Gene silencing is an important function as it keeps newly acquired
   foreign DNA repressed, thereby avoiding possible deleterious effects in
   the host organism. Known transcriptional regulators associated with this
   process are called xenogeneic silencers (XS) and belong to either the
   H-NS, Lsr2, MvaT or Rok families. In the work described here we looked
   for XS-like regulators and their distribution in prokaryotic organisms
   was evaluated. Our analysis showed that putative XS regulators similar
   to H-NS, Lsr2, MvaT or Rok are present only in bacteria (31.7\%). This
   does not exclude the existence of alternative XS in the rest of the
   organisms analyzed. Additionally, of the four XS groups evaluated in
   this work, those from the H-NS family have diversified more than the
   other groups. In order to compare the distribution of these putative XS
   regulators we also searched for other nucleoid-associated proteins
   (NAPs) not included in this group such as Fis, EbfC/YbaB, HU/IHF and
   Alba. Results showed that NAPs from the Fis, EbfC/YbaB, HU/IHF and Alba
   families are widely (94\%) distributed among prokaryotes. These NAPs
   were found in multiple combinations with or without XS-like proteins. In
   regard with XS regulators, results showed that only XS proteins from one
   family were found in those organisms containing them. This suggests
   specificity for this type of regulators and their corresponding genomes.

Abstract = {The Ti-6Al-4V alloy is used for biomedical implants due to its corrosion
   resistance and biocompatibility, associated with the spontaneous
   formation of TiO2 oxide. However, the native film may be flawed and
   after some time of implantation in the body it may release metal ions.
   Oxides of higher thickness than naturally grown can be produced by
   anodic oxidation.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the corrosion resistance of
   anodic TiO2 coatings, evaluating the influence of the thickness and
   crystalline structure of the coatings. Amorphous coatings were obtained
   from 27 to 140nm that crystallized in anatase and rutile phases by heat
   treatment. The corrosion resistance was evaluated by potentiodynamic
   measurements in 0.9\% sodium chloride, which is the main component of
   physiological solution. Evaluation of the electrochemical parameters
   showed that anodic coatings are more efficient barrier than the natural

Title = {Habitat selection in reintroduced giant anteaters: the critical role of

Abstract = {Habitat selection by the 1st reintroduced population of giant anteaters
   (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) was studied at Ibera Nature Reserve
   (northeastern Argentina), a subtropical region of wetlands, grasslands,
   and forests, with properties dedicated to nature conservation or
   livestock production. Eighteen animals were released and radiotracked
   between 2007 and 2012 for periods of 6-46 months, producing 1,181
   locations. The effect of land use was assessed using chi-square tests.
   Resource selection functions were used to assess habitat selection at 2
   spatial scales using as covariates habitat type (grassland, open
   savanna, closed savanna, and hygrophilous forest), distance to forest
   edge, and distance to a main road. Habitat selection was modeled for
   different ages (juveniles and adults), activity (resting or active), and
   seasons (summer, transition, and winter) and was validated with
   individuals previously excluded from our analysis. Anteaters strongly
   selected areas dedicated to nature conservation. Adults showed higher
   model fit. Hygrophilous forest was positively selected and open savanna
   was avoided. Anteaters rested almost exclusively in forests. While
   active they increased the use of other habitats, except for open
   savanna. Grasslands were most used during the winter season, probably
   because they provide a constant food source and better cover than
   savannas. Even though <4\% of the landscape was covered by forests, this
   habitat proved to be important for giant anteaters. Deforestation and
   traditional cattle management may have caused the local extinction of
   the species at Ibera. Establishment of strict conservation areas in
   nonflooded areas combined with proper management of forests and
   livestock may be essential for the long-term survival of reintroduced
   populations in Ibera and similar regions. (C) 2015 American Society of

Title = {Effective temperatures and the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation
   for particle suspensions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {143},

Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {The short-and long-time breakdown of the classical Stokes-Einstein
   relation for colloidal suspensions at arbitrary volume fractions is
   explained here by examining the role that confinement and attractive
   interactions play in the intra-and inter-cage dynamics executed by the
   colloidal particles. We show that the measured short-time diffusion
   coefficient is larger than the one predicted by the classical
   Stokes-Einstein relation due to a non-equilibrated energy transfer
   between kinetic and configuration degrees of freedom. This transfer can
   be incorporated in an effective kinetic temperature that is higher than
   the temperature of the heat bath. We propose a Generalized
   Stokes-Einstein relation (GSER) in which the effective temperature
   replaces the temperature of the heat bath. This relation then allows to
   obtain the diffusion coefficient once the viscosity and the effective
   temperature are known. On the other hand, the temporary cluster
   formation induced by confinement and attractive interactions of
   hydrodynamic nature makes the long-time diffusion coefficient to be
   smaller than the corresponding one obtained from the classical
   Stokes-Einstein relation. Then, the use of the GSER allows to obtain an
   effective temperature that is smaller than the temperature of the heat
   bath. Additionally, we provide a simple expression based on a
   differential effective medium theory that allows to calculate the
   diffusion coefficient at short and long times. Comparison of our results
   with experiments and simulations for suspensions of hard and porous
   spheres shows an excellent agreement in all cases. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) has been compared with other
   methods regarding its performance to identify areas of endemism. It is
   frequently compared with the Analysis of Endemicity (AE), which seems to
   perform better than PAE to identify these areas. Here I compare PAE and
   AE considering the sympatric taxa diagnosed as endemic, being as
   strictly close as possible to sympatry, and using previously published
   data of Sciobius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). AE identified more
   candidate areas of endemism than PAE, but the number of highly
   restricted endemic taxa to these areas was insufficient to support them
   as areas of endemism. Considering strictly sympatry (homopatry), PAE
   performed better than AE; however, both methods may identify areas with
   some grade of sympatry, but the recognition of which areas constitute
   real areas of endemism in the strict sense depends on the interpretation
   of the researcher.},

Abstract = {The metabolism of microbial organisms and its diversity are partly the
   result of an adaptation process to the characteristics of the
   environments that they inhabit. In this work, we analyze the influence
   of lifestyle on the content of promiscuous enzymes in 761 nonredundant
   bacterial and archaeal genomes. Promiscuous enzymes were defined as
   those proteins whose catalytic activities are defined by two or more
   different Enzyme Commission (E.C.) numbers. The genomes analyzed were
   categorized into four lifestyles for their exhaustive comparisons:
   free-living, extremophiles, pathogens, and intracellular. From these
   analyses we found that free-living organisms have larger genomes and an
   enrichment of promiscuous enzymes. In contrast, intracellular organisms
   showed smaller genomes and the lesser proportion of promiscuous enzymes.
   On the basis of our data, we show that the proportion of promiscuous
   enzymes in an organism is mainly influenced by the lifestyle, where
   fluctuating environments promote its emergence. Finally, we evidenced
   that duplication processes occur preferentially in metabolism of
   free-living and extremophiles species. Proteins 2015; 83:1625-1631. (c)

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The identification of areas of endemism is an essential step in analyses
   of evolutionary biogeography. Areas of endemism have been defined by the
   congruency of two or more distributional areas, where there is a general
   assumption that the endemic taxa have a similar geographic response to
   historical and environmental factors. Mammals are highly diverse in the
   Neotropics, and most of them have evolved together with that
   biogeographical region. However, there are few hypotheses of areas of
   endemism that may be related with the evolution of the mammals in the
   Neotropics. We analyzed a matrix of 2052 taxa (families, genera and
   species) to identify the areas of endemism of the Neotropical mammals.
   The search of areas of endemism was performed using the Analysis of
   Endemicity method in a grid of 2 degrees latitude - longitude. The
   analysis resulted in 101 areas and 498 endemic taxa, the areas partially
   matched with 65 biogeographical patterns previously identified by other
   authors. The Neotropical region is composed of nine areas of endemism
   and showed multiples boundaries, these characteristics suggest a dynamic
   pattern. Two complex areas of biotic interchange corresponded with the
   Mexican and Southamerican transitional zones. On one side, the
   congruence of areas of endemism of mammals with other biogeographical
   patterns suggests that historical and ecological factors have shaped the
   structure of those areas. On the other side, the incongruence of some
   areas of endemism supports a biogeographical system without hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Variation in the age at first reproduction may have important
   implications for growth and dynamics of populations, but these potential
   impacts remain virtually unexplored. By using 26 years of data from a
   marked colony of blue-footed boobies Sula nebouxii (Milne-Edwards), we
   tested whether survival of early recruits is lower in comparison to late
   recruits, and investigate how different recruiting ages contribute to
   the persistence of the population. In addition, we simulated changes in
   the age at recruitment and estimated their impact on population fitness.
   Our analyses of 1310 capture-recapture histories revealed that the
   younger males and females initiated reproduction within the first 6
   years of life, the lower were their mean annual survival probabilities.
   Survival did not differ between the sexes and the impact of recruiting
   age on survival was similar for males and females. Each additional year
   that male and female boobies delayed the start of reproduction meant an
   increase of roughly 2 \% in their annual survival rates. Male and female
   recruits 2-5 years old contributed the same to the rate of population
   growth (lambda) regardless of their particular age, but the contribution
   to population growth started to decline from age 6 years. According to
   our simulations, delaying reproduction beyond 5 years in the case of
   females, and beyond 6 years in the case of males, would negatively
   affect this booby population. Therefore, we suggest that there is
   selection against recruiting beyond 5-6 years old. This study adds to
   the nascent empirical literature on long-term fitness consequences of
   variation in the age at first reproduction in long-lived species, and
   provides insights into evolution of early and late reproduction and
   trade-offs from a demographic perspective.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {74-95},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We prove that an isometric immersion of a simply connected Lorentzian
   surface in R-2,R-2 is equivalent to a normalised spinor field solution
   of a Dirac equation on the surface. Using the quaternions and the
   Lorentz numbers, we also obtain an explicit representation formula of
   the immersion in terms of the spinor field. We then apply the
   representation formula in R-2,R-2 to give a new spinor representation
   formula for Lorentzian surfaces in 3-dimensional Minkowski space.
   Finally, we apply the representation formula to the local description of
   the flat Lorentzian surfaces with flat normal bundle and regular Gauss
   map in R-2,R-2, and show that these surfaces locally depend on four real
   functions of one real variable, or on one holomorphic function together
   with two real functions of one real variable, depending on the sign of a
   natural invariant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY OF OAK FORESTS IN THE EL TEPOZTECO NATIONAL PARK

Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {93},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Quercus (oak) is among the most speciose and widespread genera occurring
   in Mexico; paradoxically, the ecological knowledge about Mexican oak
   forests is meager. Here we describe the floristic composition,
   diversity, and structure of the terrestrial component of the oak forests
   of the El Tepozteco National Park (TNP), Central Mexico, and relate
   their floristic and structural heterogeneity to the geomorphological
   complexity of the park. We randomly distributed sixty 100-m(2) plots
   among six geomorphological units: the lava fields of the Chichinautzin,
   Suchiooc, Otates (upper and lower) and Oclayuca volcanoes, and the El
   Tepozteco Range. Vegetation structure and diversity were described by
   geomorphological unit and for the oak forest as a whole for canopy (DBH
   >= 2.5 cm) and understory plants. We report 324 vascular plant species
   recorded in the plots, plus 17 species collected outside the plots (a
   total of 341 species, 208 genera and 88 families). The family with more
   species was Asteraceae (57) and the most speciose genus was Salvia (10).
   Geomorphological units differed in mean species richness per plot
   (12.0-33.5 species), absolute richness (60-149 species), and species'
   structural contributions. Structural differences were also observed, but
   they were not always significant. Quercus rugosa was dominant in
   Chichinautzin, Suchiooc, and upper Otates; Styrax ramirezii in lower
   Otates and Oclayuca, and Quercus castanea and Q. obtusata shared
   dominance in El Tepozteco Range (the unit with the largest overall
   richness and oak species diversity). The structure and composition of
   TNP oak forests are highly variable, apparently due to the region's
   complex geological past. This heterogeneity should guide the
   conservation and restoration of these forests.},

Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {91 taxa of benthic diatoms were recorded at several sites in the lake
   district Xochimilco-Tlahuac representing an increase of over 50 \% in
   the floristic inventory of diatoms in this area. The study was based on
   analysis of 13 collections with fortnightly and monthly sampling during
   the dry and rainy seasons, simultaneously recording several
   environmental factors that supported a comparative analysis for changes
   in species richness between study sites and collections. An ecological
   categorization of species allowing to associate their presence with the
   environmental conditions of the lake area, arguing that the dominant
   species distinguished floristically a region, while frequent distinguish
   the local flora and rare species indicate habitat fragmentation. The
   composition and species richness showed a clear relationship with
   environmental factors and highlighted the presence of Nitzschia
   frustulum, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, Fragilaria bidens,
   Rhoicosphenia abbreviata, Fragilariforma virescens, Staurosira
   construens, S. construens var. binodis, Staurosirella leptostauron y S.
   pinnata, which are species typically found in the sediments of shallow
   and eutrophic bodies of water. Species richness was statistically
   correlated with the variation of silica and pH, which showed that
   benthic diatoms can be used as ecological indicators for monitoring
   environmental conditions in the lake district of Xochimilco-Tlahuac.},

Title = {Research on the river shrimps of the genus Macrobrachium (Bate,

Abstract = {This study revealed that the scientific interest in the genus
   Macrobrachium was not restricted to a biological point of view, but
   included also social and economic aspects. Many species of the genus are
   subject of traditional fisheries and culture worldwide. Several research
   groups across the globe have developed projects in various subject areas
   on commercial or non-commercial native species of this genus. This
   investigation aimed to contribute to the development of the genus
   Macrobrachium research through a scientometric study. The study was
   based on publications (1980 to 2013) registered in the following
   databases: Biological Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, SciELO Citation
   Index, BioOne, Science Direct, Scopus, and Redalyc. A total of 2165
   publications on Macrobrachium in the last 33 years were included in this
   analysis. The themes that yielded most posts were related to culture,
   nutrition/feeding, and genetics with almost 60\% of the total.
   Publications concerning M. rosenbergii represented more than 60\% of the
   total with the remaining 40\% encompassing 22 other species. Analysis
   performed by geographical regions evidenced that Latin America produced
   23\% of the publications, South Asia 22\%, and East Asia 16\%. Brazil
   generated 65\% of the percentage mentioned for the Latin American
   region. It is necessary to strengthen research on topics of basic
   biology, especially those of native species. This will allow rapid
   progress in the generation of production technologies sustained by a
   solid biological knowledge base.},

Title = {Environmental gradients and the evolution of successional habitat
   specialization: a test case with 14 Neotropical forest sites},

Abstract = {Successional gradients are ubiquitous in nature, yet few studies have
   systematically examined the evolutionary origins of taxa that specialize
   at different successional stages. Here we quantify successional habitat
   specialization in Neotropical forest trees and evaluate its evolutionary
   lability along a precipitation gradient. Theoretically, successional
   habitat specialization should be more evolutionarily conserved in wet
   forests than in dry forests due to more extreme microenvironmental
   differentiation between early and late-successional stages in wet
   forest. We applied a robust multinomial classification model to samples
   of primary and secondary forest trees from 14 Neotropical lowland forest
   sites spanning a precipitation gradient from 788 to 4000mm annual
   rainfall, identifying species that are old-growth specialists and
   secondary forest specialists in each site. We constructed phylogenies
   for the classified taxa at each site and for the entire set of
   classified taxa and tested whether successional habitat specialization
   is phylogenetically conserved. We further investigated differences in
   the functional traits of species specializing in secondary vs.
   old-growth forest along the precipitation gradient, expecting different
   trait associations with secondary forest specialists in wet vs. dry
   forests since water availability is more limiting in dry forests and
   light availability more limiting in wet forests. Successional habitat
   specialization is non-randomly distributed in the angiosperm phylogeny,
   with a tendency towards phylogenetic conservatism overall and a trend
   towards stronger conservatism in wet forests than in dry forests.
   However, the specialists come from all the major branches of the
   angiosperm phylogeny, and very few functional traits showed any
   consistent relationships with successional habitat specialization in
   either wet or dry forests.Synthesis. The niche conservatism evident in
   the habitat specialization of Neotropical trees suggests a role for
   radiation into different successional habitats in the evolution of
   species-rich genera, though the diversity of functional traits that lead
   to success in different successional habitats complicates analyses at
   the community scale. Examining the distribution of particular lineages
   with respect to successional gradients may provide more insight into the
   role of successional habitat specialization in the evolution of
   species-rich taxa.},

Abstract = {Apomictic Paspalum plicatulum Michx. and P. guenoarum Arechav. are
   promising candidates for forage grass development in tropical regions.
   From a plant breeding perspective, apomixis provides a unique mechanism
   for developing superior cultivars and preserving them indefinitely.
   Therefore, analysis of its inheritance is of great interest in these
   apomictic species. The objective of this work was to analyze the
   inheritance and expressivity of apomixis in interspecific families
   derived from crosses between a sexual colchicine-induced plant of P.
   plicatulum and an apomictic P. guenoarum plant. One F-1, one F-2, and
   three backcross (BC) populations were created. Amplified fragment-length
   polymorphism (AFLP) markers confirmed the hybrid origin of the F-1
   descendants. Analysis of the reproductive mode of the F-1 by flow
   cytometry seed screen (FCSS) showed a segregation ratio of 1.6:1 sexual
   vs. apomictic plants. The same analysis in F-2 and BC populations showed
   that in selfing or crosses involving sexual genotypes all progeny
   reproduced by sexuality, while BC populations involving apomictic
   hybrids as pollen donors produced offspring that segregated for the
   reproductive mode. Apomixis can be transmitted by pollen from P.
   guenoarum to other species of the Plicatula group as a simplex (Aaaa)
   Mendelian dominant factor, and full sexual reproduction requires the
   homozygous recessive (nulliplex) condition (aaaa) for the apomixis
   determinant. Results provided here are of interest for breeding
   apomictic species of Plicatula and for basic research on the genetic
   determinants of apomixis. Also, the possibility of creating new
   apomictic cultivars by traditional breeding methods is presented.},

Abstract = {Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics is used to perform a systematic
   deduction of the kinetic equations governing the opening and collapse of
   transient pores in spherical vesicles. We show that the edge tension has
   to be determined from the initial stage of the pore relaxation and that
   in the final state the vesicle membrane is not completely relaxed, since
   the surface tension and the pressure difference are about 25 \% of its
   initial value. We also show that the pore life-time is controlled by the
   solution viscosity and its opening is driven by the solution leak-out
   and the surface tension drop. The final collapse is due to a non-linear
   interplay between the edge and the surface tensions together with the
   pressure difference. We also discuss the connection with previous
   models.},

Abstract = {The phylogeny of thamnophiine snakes has not been fully resolved,
   largely because previous phylogenetic estimates have been based on
   incomplete taxon sampling or relied solely on mitochondrial sequence
   data. To address this deficiency, we collected data from multiple
   autosomal loci collected from 50 taxa before estimating the most robust
   phylogeny of Thamnophiini to date. Our findings clarify the
   relationships of taxa not previously included in molecular analyses and
   also lend evidence to previously recommended taxonomic revisions.
   Differences in topological estimates between competing models of
   evolution were minimal and not strongly supported; however, a
   multispecies coalescent model of evolution was highly favoured over a
   concatenated model based on marginal likelihood estimates. Additionally,
   we estimated the timing of divergence among the three major lineages to
   have occurred during the Miocene period (approximately 11-14Mya),
   followed by a decline in speciation rates in all major lineages.},

Abstract = {An investigation and a description of the corion morphology of
   Biblidinae sensu Lamas (2004) subfamily are made, including
   representative genera from all tribes and subtribes (Marpesia, Biblis,
   Mestra, Catonephele, Eunica, Myscelia, Hamadryas, Nica, Pyrrhogyra,
   Temenis, Dynamine, Diaethria, and Callicore); a selection of genera did
   not make, but were taken from those available in recent samplings in
   Mexico. The study is based on a sample of 121 females collected at
   various locations in Mexico and in some cases from literature-taken
   illustrations. The main structural features of the chorion were
   characterized: color, shape, size, ornamentation, perimycropilar
   differentiation, and the formation of axes and ribs. Specialized
   structures in the apical and equatorial zones are characterized, and
   also the degree of thickening of the axes. Three types of eggs are
   recognized: aciculate, globose, and crested, the latter comprising nine
   subtypes according to each crest shape. Plates, diagrams, and a glossary
   of terms adopted in this work are appended. Finally, synthesis of the
   various proposals for Biblidinae classification between 1886 and 2009 is
   presented, together with their graphical representation. A comparison is
   made between previous classifications and the results obtained through
   the study of chorionic structures. Our results support the
   classification of Lamas (2004) with some modifications. Chorion
   characters are very important to find and maintain supraspecific
   relations in Biblidinae.},

Abstract = {The epicontinental aquatic systems are an important component in the
   global carbon cycle. In order to generate a baseline as whether tropical
   lakes act as carbon dioxide (CO2) source or sink, we evaluated the gross
   (GPP) and net (NPP) primary production and respiration (R) in the
   euphotic zone of a deep, oligotrophic, tropical lake. GPP fluctuated
   between 1,809 and 4,195 mg C m(-2) d(-1); three peaks were observed
   throughout the year. These peaks are associated to the three main
   phytoplankton events of Lake Alchichica: the diatom bloom during the
   mixing period, the cyanobacteria bloom at the onset of the
   stratification period and the deep chlorophyll maximum along the
   stratification. R varied between 87 and 5,966 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Despite
   its oligotrophic condition, Lake Alchichica acts as a CO2 sink because
   it is mostly autotrophic along the year. The annual gross primary
   production (GPP) exceeds respiration (GPP: R = 4.39 +/- 6.84) and
   therefore, the annual NPP was is positive.},

Title = {Drug Development in Conformational Diseases: A Novel Family of Chemical
   Chaperones that Bind and Stabilise Several Polymorphic Amyloid
   Structures},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of conformational diseases, including
   Alzheimer's disease, type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cancer, poses a global
   challenge at many different levels. It has devastating effects on the
   sufferers as well as a tremendous economic impact on families and the
   health system. In this work, we apply a cross-functional approach that
   combines ideas, concepts and technologies from several disciplines in
   order to study, in silico and in vitro, the role of a novel chemical
   chaperones family (NCHCHF) in processes of protein aggregation in
   conformational diseases. Given that Serum Albumin (SA) is the most
   abundant protein in the blood of mammals, and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
   is an off-the-shelf protein available in most labs around the world, we
   compared the ligandability of BSA: NCHCHF with the interaction sites in
   the Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (hIAPP): NCHCHF, and in the amyloid
   pharmacophore fragments (A beta 17-42 and A beta 16-21): NCHCHF. We
   posit that the merging of this interaction sites is a meta-structure of
   pharmacophore which allows the development of chaperones that can
   prevent protein aggregation at various states from: stabilizing the
   native state to destabilizing oligomeric state and protofilament.
   Furthermore to stabilize fibrillar structures, thus decreasing the
   amount of toxic oligomers in solution, as is the case with the NCHCHF.
   The paper demonstrates how a set of NCHCHF can be used for studying and
   potentially treating the various physiopathological stages of a
   conformational disease. For instance, when dealing with an acute phase
   of cytotoxicity, what is needed is the recruitment of cytotoxic
   oligomers, thus chaperone F, which accelerates fiber formation, would be
   very useful; whereas in a chronic stage it is better to have chaperones
   A, B, C, and D, which stabilize the native and fibril structures halting
   self-catalysis and the creation of cytotoxic oligomers as a consequence
   of fiber formation. Furthermore, all the chaperones are able to protect
   and recondition the cerebellar granule cells (CGC) from the cytotoxicity
   produced by the hIAPP(20-29) fragment or by a low potassium medium,
   regardless of their capacity for accelerating or inhibiting in vitro
   formation of fibers. In vivo animal experiments are required to study
   the impact of chemical chaperones in cognitive and metabolic syndromes.},

Abstract = {The chaetognath Flaccisagitta enflata abundance was determined in the
   Bahia Magdalena lagoon complex, Baja California Sur, Mexico. This study
   is based on two sampling methods, in the first one zooplankton was
   collected from a basic plan of 28 stations, for eight months in 1982,
   and the second, during 24-hour cycle, August 1-2 during 1988. The
   capture of organisms was made with a standard conical net of 0.3 m of
   mouth diameter, 1 m long, and 0.3 mm of mesh size. Analysis revealed
   that F. enflata average abundances were low from February to June, and
   significantly higher from July to December (p<0.05). The results of the
   24-hour cycle, showed that the total abundance of chaetognaths and F.
   enflata follows the same trend with the tidal cycle. However, no
   significant differences day/night capture (p< 0.05) were observed
   between different species of chaetognaths, except for Parasagitta
   euneritica, Serratosagitta bierii and Mesosagitta minima. The presence
   of individuals of F. enflata 2.0 mm (new born) and adults near the mouth
   of access to the lagoon, were possibly transported from the adjacent
   oceanic area during the influx of warm waters from August to November.},

Title = {Wild populations of the invasive Australian red claw crayfish
   Cherax quadricarinatus (Crustacea, Decapoda) near the

Abstract = {The red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus is native to freshwater
   habitats of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Its high
   reproductive and adaptive capacity in different environments allows it
   to be cultivated, where escaped individuals have established wild
   populations in countries far from their natural range. In the late 90's
   and beginning of the 21st century, this crayfish was introduced
   illegally along the coast of southern Jalisco. Mismanagement led to
   escape and dispersion. Currently there are wild crayfish in the Cajon de
   Penas Reservoir and surrounding streams in northern Jalisco, Mexico. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of C. quadricarinatus in
   fisheries in this area of Jalisco and analyze its importance in
   generating economic benefits for fishermen, comparing these results with
   those of the fishery for M. americanum, whose fishery is traditional. To
   catch specimens, traps were set for 24 h in the La Sanja Stream and the
   Cajon de Penas Reservoir. The results of the survey showed that C.
   quadrica rinatus is an important part of the crustacean catch in this
   area: 32\% of the total catch in the stream corresponded to C.
   quadricarinatus and the rest to M. americanum. While 85\% of the catch
   in the dam corresponded to C. quadricarinatus, only 15\% referred to M.
   americanum. Crayfish fishing in the reservoir is now an important part
   of the productive activity of local families dependent on fishing. The
   ecological consequences of wild crayfish proliferation remain to be
   studied.},

Abstract = {The status of subspecies in systematic zoology is the focus of
   controversy. Recent studies use DNA sequences to evaluate the status of
   subspecies within species complexes and to recognize and delimit
   species. Here, we assessed the phylogenetic relationships, the taxonomic
   status of the proposed subspecies, and the species limits of the
   monotypic hummingbird genus Eugenes (E. fulgens with traditionally
   recognized subspecies E. f. fulgens, E. f viridiceps, and E. f.
   spectabilis), using nuclear (Beta Fibrinogen BFib, Ornithine
   Decarboxylase ODC, and Muscle Skeletal Receptor Tyrosine Kinase MUSK)
   and mitochondrial (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 ND2, NADH dehydrogenase
   subunit 4 ND4, and Control Region CR) markers. We performed Bayesian and
   Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography analyses and found genetic
   differences between the three groups, suggesting the existence of two
   cryptic species (E. fulgens and E. viridiceps) and one phenotypically
   differentiated species (E. spectabilis). Our analyses show that the E.
   viridiceps and E. fulgens groups are more closely related with one
   another than with E. spectabilis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   Historical Demographic Patterns in Philippine Birds},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {Phylogeographic studies of Philippine birds support that deep genetic
   structure occurs across continuous lowland forests within islands,
   despite the lack of obvious contemporary isolation mechanisms. To
   examine the pattern and tempo of diversification within Philippine
   island forests, and test if common mechanisms are responsible for
   observed differentiation, we focused on three co-distributed lowland
   bird taxa endemic to Greater Luzon and Greater Negros-Panay: Blue-headed
   Fantail (Rhipidura cyaniceps), White-browed Shama (Copsychus
   luzoniensis), and Lemon-throated Leaf-Warbler (Phylloscopus cebuensis).
   Each species has two described subspecies within Greater Luzon, and a
   single described subspecies on Greater Negros/Panay. Each of the three
   focal species showed a common geographic pattern of two monophyletic
   groups in Greater Luzon sister to a third monophyletic group found in
   Greater Negros-Panay, suggesting that common or similar biogeographic
   processes may have produced similar distributions. However, studied
   species displayed variable levels of mitochondrial DNA differentiation
   between clades, and genetic differentiation within Luzon was not
   necessarily concordant with described subspecies boundaries. Population
   genetic parameters for the three species suggested both rapid population
   growth from small numbers and geographic expansion across Luzon Island.
   Estimates of the timing of population expansion further supported that
   these events occurred asynchronously throughout the Pleistocene in the
   focal species, demanding particular explanations for differentiation,
   and support that co-distribution may be secondarily congruent.},

Title = {Irrigation and avifaunal change in coastal NorthwestMexico: has
   irrigated habit attracted threatened migratory species?},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Irrigation in desert ecosystems can either reduce or increase species
   diversity. Groundwater pumping often lowers water tables and reduces
   natural wetlands, whereas canal irrigation often creates mesic habitat,
   resulting in great increases in avian diversity from irrigation. Here we
   compare a dataset of potential natural vegetation to recent datasets
   from areal and satellite imagery to show that 60\% of the land in the
   coastal plain of southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa lying below 200 m
   elevation has been converted by irrigation to more mesic habitats. We
   then use the record of bird specimens in the world's museums from this
   same region of Mexico to examine the avian community before and after
   the development of extensive irrigation. In general these museum records
   show an increase in the abundance and diversity of breeding birds
   associated with mesic habitats. Although thorn forest birds have likely
   decreased in total numbers, most are common enough in the remaining
   thorn forest that collection records did not indicate their probable
   decline. Four migrants having most of their breeding ranges in the US or
   Canada, Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Cliff Swallow, Bell's Vireo, and Orchard
   Oriole, apparently have increased dramatically as breeders in irrigated
   habitats of NW Mexico. Because these species have decreased or even
   largely disappeared as breeding birds in parts of the US or Canada,
   further research should assess whether their increases in new mesic
   habitats of NW Mexico are linked to their declines as breeding birds in
   Canada and the US For Bell's Vireo recent specimens from Sinaloa suggest
   its new breeding population in NW Mexico may be composed partly of the
   endangered Least Bell's Vireo.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},

Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {A new species of scorpion is described based on a rare entire adult male
   preserved in a cloudy amber from Miocene rocks in the Chiapas Highlands,
   south of Mexico. The amber-bearing beds in Chiapas constitute a
   Conservation Lagerstatte with outstanding organic preservation inside
   plant resin. The new species is diagnosed as having putative characters
   that largely correspond with the genus Tityus Koch, 1836 (Scorpiones,
   Buthidae). Accordingly, it is now referred to as Tityus apozonalli sp.
   nov. Its previously unclear phylogenetic relationship among fossil taxa
   of the family Buthidae from both Dominican and Mexican amber is also
   examined herein. Preliminarily results indicate a basal condition of T.
   apozonalli regarding to Tityus geratus Santiago-Blay and Poinar, 1988,
   Tityus (Brazilotityus) hartkorni Lourenco, 2009, and Tityus azari
   Lourenco, 2013 from Dominican amber, as was Tityus (Brazilotityus)
   knodeli Lourenco, 2014 from Mexican amber. Its close relationships with
   extant Neotropic Tityus-like subclades such as `Tityus clathratus' and
   the subgenus Tityus (Archaeotityus) are also discussed. This new taxon
   adds to the knowledge of New World scorpions from the Miocene that are
   rarely found trapped in amber.},

Title = {HELMINTH COMMUNITIES OF CYPRINODON ATRORUS IN THE NATURAL

Abstract = {The helminth fauna of the bolson pupfish Cyprinodon atrorus
   (Osteichthyes: Cyprinodontidae) consisted of 7 helminth taxa collected
   from 7 localities of Cuatro Cienegas, a natural area protected by the
   Mexican government in Coahuila, northern Mexico. The helminth community
   is described at the infracommunity and component community levels. The
   acanthocephalan Atactorhynchus duranguensis was the most prevalent and
   abundant species. The remaining species were rare and found at low mean
   abundance values. The observed species richness, individual parasite
   abundance, and diversity were low at both component community and
   infracommunity levels. These findings are similar to those found in
   other freshwater fish species in the Nearctic part of Mexico; however,
   our study shows that the number of larval forms, in terms of species
   richness and abundance, is very low in comparison with previous studies
   in the area. Isolation of the Cuatro Cienegas basin from the Bravo River
   (= Grande River) basins is suggested as the main factor determining the
   depauperate helminth assemblage. The low number of individual larval
   stages in this fish species is probably due to the lack of piscivorous
   birds in the area.},

Abstract = {The red octopus Octopus maya is an endemic species of the continental
   shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico and supports the largest octopus
   fishery in the American continent. Little is, however, known about its
   spatial dynamics. The study of the space-time variation of catchability
   is a key element in the stock assessment, because it allows behavioral
   aspects of the resource and qualities of the various exploitation
   strategies to be clarified, which are essential for the fishery
   management. The objective was to analyze the spatio-temporal variations
   of the abundance and catchability of the octopus O. maya on the
   continental shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. During the fishing
   season of 2012 (August-December), fishery landings from the small-scale
   fleet in 13 ports of the Yucatan Peninsula, were analyzed to obtain data
   on catch, effort and fishing zone for O. maya. During the closed season
   of 2013 (January-July) fishing hauls were performed across a network of
   stations along the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. Spatio-temporal
   variations in mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) in terms of number of
   organisms per hour of effective fishing were analyzed. Catchability and
   its variation with size, time, and zone were estimated through a model
   based on the Leslie transition matrix and frequency distributions of
   mantle length. The results showed significant changes in the
   distribution of O. maya. During the fishing season, the greatest
   abundances were found along the coast of Campeche (western zone),
   whereas, during the closed season the highest abundances were recorded
   along the coast of Yucatan (eastern zone). Trends of decreasing and
   increasing catchability were observed with respect to size according to
   the different zones. A high catchability was presented for small sizes
   along the coast of Campeche during the fishing season. The results
   indicate the need to investigate possible management measures
   differentiated by region (west-east) to ensure the fishery
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Oxidative stress is a biochemical state of imbalance in the production
   of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and antioxidant defenses. It is
   involved in the physiopathology of degenerative and chronic neuronal
   disorders, such as epilepsy. Experimental evidence in humans and animals
   support the involvement of oxidative stress before and after seizures.
   In the past few years, research has increasingly focused on the
   molecular pathways of this process, such as that involving transcription
   factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which plays a central
   role in the regulation of antioxidant response elements (ARE) and
   modulates cellular redox status. The aim of this review is to present
   experimental evidence on the role of Nrf2 in this neurological disorder
   and to further determine the therapeutic impact of Nrf2 in epilepsy.},

Abstract = {In many butterfly species of the family Lycaenidae, the morphology and
   color pattern of the hind wings, together with certain behaviors,
   suggests the presence of a false head (FH) at the posterior end of the
   perching individual. This FH is considered an adaptation to escape from
   visually oriented predators. A frequent component of the FH are the
   tails that presumably resemble the antennae, and the typical hind wings
   back-and-forth movement along the sagittal plane (HWM) performed while
   perching apparently move the tails in a way that mimics antennal
   movement. By exposing 33 individuals from 18 species of Lycaenidae to a
   stuffed insectivorous bird, we tested two alternative hypotheses
   regarding HWM. The first hypothesis proposes that, when the butterfly is
   observed at close range, the HWM distorts the shape of the false head
   thus reducing its deceiving effect and, therefore, selection will favor
   butterflies that stop moving their wings when a predator is close by;
   the second hypothesis says that an increase in the frequency of HWM
   improves its deflective effect when the butterfly confronts a predator
   at close range. Our results tend to support the second hypothesis
   because half of the butterflies started to move their hind wings or
   increased the rate of HWM when exposed to the stuffed bird; however a
   substantial proportion of butterflies (30\%) stopped moving their hind
   wings or decreased the rate of HWM as expected from the first
   hypothesis. Our observations also showed that there is great variation
   in the rates of HWM, and demonstrated the existence of alternative ways
   of producing ``vivid{''} movement of the hind wing tails (the ``false
   antennae{''}) in the absence of HWM},

Abstract = {Rice husk was employed as a source for producing silica micro- and
   nanoparticles through its digestion by soil fauna. Although many
   physicochemical methods for producing nanostructures have been studied,
   the biological processes remain mostly unexplored. Alkaline hydrogen
   peroxide with continuous control of reaction pH allowed removal of
   lignin bonds while preserving most of the cell wall and the silica
   present in the rice husk. The accessibility of lignocellulose was
   achieved without removing appreciable amounts of lignin, so this

Title = {Halffter's Mexican transition zone (1962-2014), cenocrons and
   evolutionary biogeography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {The Mexican transition zone is the complex and varied area in which the
   Neotropical and Nearctic biotas overlap. In a series of contributions,
   Gonzalo Halffter provided a coherent theory that explains how sets of
   taxa that evolved in different geographical areas assembled in this
   transition zone. Halffter's theory developed gradually, being refined
   and clarified in successive contributions from him and other authors.
   After a review of the historical development of the Mexican transition
   zone, including the characterization of the dispersal or distributional
   patterns recognized by Halffter, its relevance for evolutionary
   biogeography is discussed briefly. The Mexican transition zone in the
   strict sense includes the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala (Sierra
   Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican Volcanic Belt,
   Sierra Madre del Sur and Chiapas Highlands provinces), whereas northern
   Mexico and the southern United States are clearly Nearctic, and the
   lowlands of southern Mexico and Central America are clearly Neotropical.
   The distributional patterns recognized by Halffter are considered to
   represent cenocrons (sets of taxa that share the same biogeographical
   history, constituting identifiable subsets within a biota by their
   common biotic origin and evolutionary history). The development of the
   Mexican transition zone is summarized into the following stages: (1)
   Jurassic-Cretaceous: the four Paleoamerican cenocrons extend in Mexico;
   (2) Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene: dispersal from South America of the
   Plateau cenocron; (3) Oligocene-Miocene: dispersal from the Central
   American Nucleus of the Mountain Mesoamerican cenocron; (4)
   Miocene-Pliocene: dispersal from North America of the Nearctic cenocron;
   and (5) Pleistocene: dispersal from South America of the Typical
   Neotropical cenocron.
   Resumen La zona de transicion Mexicana de Halffter (1962-2014), los
   cenocrones y la biogeografia evolutiva La zona de transicion Mexicana es
   un area compleja y variada donde se superponen las biotas neotropical y
   neartica. En una serie de contribuciones, Gonzalo Halffter proporciono
   una teoria coherente que explica como conjuntos de taxones que
   evolucionaron en diferentes areas geograficas se ensamblaron en esta
   zona de transicion. La teoria de Halffter se desarrollo gradualmente,
   siendo refinada y clarificada en sucesivas contribuciones de el y otros
   autores. Luego de revisar el desarrollo historico de la zona de
   transicion Mexicana, incluyendo la caracterizacion de los patrones de
   dispersion o distribucionales reconocidos por Halffter, se discute
   brevemente su relevancia para la biogeografia evolutiva. La zona de
   transicion Mexicana en sentido estricto incluye las tierras altas de
   Mexico y Guatemala (provincias de la Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra
   Madre Oriental, Faja Volcanica Transmexicana, Sierra Madre del Sur y
   Tierras Altas de Chiapas), mientras que el norte de Mexico y el sur de
   los Estados Unidos son claramente nearticos y que las tierras bajas del
   sur de Mexico y America Central son claramente neotropicales. Los
   patrones distribucionales reconocidos por Halffter se consideran
   cenocrones (conjuntos de taxones que comparten una misma historia
   biogeografica, constituyendo subconjuntos identificables dentro de una
   biota por su origen biotico comun y su historia evolutiva). El
   desarrollo de la zona de transicion Mexicana se resume en las siguientes
   etapas: (1) Jurasico-Cretacico: los cuatro cenocrones paleoamericanos se
   extienden en Mexico; (2) Cretacico Superior-Paleoceno: dispersion desde
   America del Sur del cenocron del Altiplano; (3) Oligoceno-Mioceno:
   dispersion desde el Nucleo Centroamericano del cenocron Mesoamericano de
   Montana; (4) Mioceno-Plioceno: dispersion desde America del Norte del
   cenocron Neartico; y (5) Plioceno-Pleistoceno: dispersion desde America
   del Sur del cenocron Neotropical Tipico.},

Title = {Can acoustic emissions be used to size bubbles seeping from a sediment
   bed?},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {187-196},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Experiments on bubble formation from a granular medium are presented.
   The granular medium consisted of immersed stones giving a sediment bed
   thickness of 10 cm. High speed photographic and acoustic passive
   wireless techniques were employed to obtain the bubble size. The power
   spectra of the acoustic data for bubble production of 0.5 bubbles/s
   showed the existence of two principal peaks which are correlated with
   two discrete events. Firstly, a signal peak at 0497 kHz, representing
   asymmetric bubble detachment, and secondly, a peak at 2.070 kHz, which
   corresponded to interactions of the granular media as inter-particle
   gaps advance, representing elastic resistance to orifice creation.
   Provided the signals were windowed to the bubble-detachment event only,
   the classical bubble-acoustical Minnaert relation for the bubble size
   agreed with optical data within about 10\%. Since seepage generates
   discrete bubble pulses, appropriate acoustic analyses could both count
   and size the bubbles formed. The results of this study lead to the
   proposition that underwater acoustic sensors could warn of critical
   changes in bubble-seep behavior over time This could lead to the
   possibility of remote early warnings, because shifts in production-rate
   regimes from seeps may herald alterations in the progression of global
   warming, or impending earthquakes and tsunamis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {A distinctive morphotype consisting of an epilithic, one-layered colony
   of polarized, 1-3-celled pseudofilaments was recognized in the rocky
   shores of the state of Oaxaca in the Mexican tropical Pacific.
   Morphologically, it was not identifiable as any species of a previously
   described genus. It is similar to species from the former order
   Chroococcales, recently modified by Komarek et al. (2014), in its
   sessile heteropolar pseudofilaments. Specifically, it is most similar to
   the colonial species of the genus Chamaesiphon; and of Chamaecalyx, but
   the cells of the Mexican populations divide symmetrically in one or two
   planes, differentiating them from Chamaesiphon which divides
   asymmetrically and only in one plane, and from Chamaecalyx, which has
   multiple fission. The other defining feature is that all cells of the
   pseudofilament have differentiated mucilaginous structures (pad and/or
   stipe and cup). It has not been possible to obtain cultures of our
   material for further studies to complete the polyphasic approach.
   Nevertheless, its morphological characteristics and life cycle, plus its
   distinctive extreme biotope, form a unique combination of features that
   derive in our proposal of the morphogenus Nisada gen. nov., with the
   type species, Nisada stipitata, sp. nov. We describe the proposed taxa
   and the problems and current inconveniences regarding its assignment to
   higher taxonomic levels. We also discuss the different degrees of
   complexity of heteropolarity in Nisada and other taxa.},

Title = {Leptospirosis in Mexico: Epidemiology and Potential Distribution of
   Human Cases},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {Background
   Leptospirosis is widespread in Mexico, yet the potential distribution
   and risk of the disease remain unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We analysed morbidity and mortality according to age and gender based on
   three sources of data reported by the Ministry of Health and the
   National Institute of Geography and Statics of Mexico, for the decade
   2000-2010. A total of 1,547 cases were reported in 27 states, the
   majority of which were registered during the rainy season, and the most
   affected age group was 25-44 years old. Although leptospirosis has been
   reported as an occupational disease of males, analysis of morbidity in
   Mexico showed no male preference. A total number of 198 deaths were
   registered in 21 states, mainly in urban settings. Mortality was higher
   in males (61.1\%) as compared to females (38.9\%), and the case fatality
   ratio was also increased in males. The overall case fatality ratio in
   Mexico was elevated (12.8\%), as compared to other countries. We
   additionally determined the potential disease distribution by examining
   the spatial epidemiology combined with spatial modeling using ecological
   niche modeling techniques. We identified regions where leptospirosis
   could be present and created a potential distribution map using
   bioclimatic variables derived from temperature and precipitation. Our
   data show that the distribution of the cases was more related to
   temperature (75\%) than to precipitation variables. Ecological niche
   modeling showed predictive areas that were widely distributed in central
   and southern Mexico, excluding areas characterized by extreme climates.
   Conclusions/Significance
   In conclusion, an epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis is
   recommended in Mexico, since 55.7\% of the country has environmental
   conditions fulfilling the criteria that favor the presence of the
   disease.},

Abstract = {The structural and elastic properties of the RFeO3 phases with R = Y,
   Eu, and La were investigated using first-principles plane-wave
   pseudopotential density functional theory with the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA). The ground state properties (equilibrium cell
   constants) agree well with the reported experimental results. Our
   results showed an increase in the unit-cell volume (V) with the increase
   of ionic radii. We calculate a set of elastic parameters (bulk modulus
   B-VRH, shear modulus G(VRH), Young's modulus E-VRH and Poisson's ratio
   nu) in the framework of the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) approximation. The
   sound velocities (upsilon(l), upsilon(t)) and Debye temperature
   (theta(D)) were calculated using these elastic moduli. The calculated
   elastic constants were positives and satisfy the well-known Born
   criteria, indicating that the orthorhombic structure is stable. Finally,
   the ratio G(VRH)/B-VRH suggests that the RFeO3 phases are ductile in
   nature.},

Abstract = {The supratidal and intertidal zones are extreme biotopes. Recent surveys
   of the supratidal and intertidal fringe of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico,
   have shown that the cyanoprokaryotes are frequently the dominant forms
   and the heterocytous species form abundant and conspicuous epilithic
   growths. Five of the eight special morphotypes (Brasilonema sp.,
   Myochrotes sp., Ophiothrix sp., Petalonema sp. and Calothrix sp.) from
   six localities described and discussed in this paper, are new reports
   for the tropical Mexican coast and the other three (Kyrtuthrix cf.
   maculans, Scytonematopsis cf. crustacea and Hassallia littoralis) extend
   their known distribution.},

Abstract = {Analytical expressions are derived for the distribution rates of spatial
   coincidences in the counting of photons produced by spontaneous
   parametric down conversion. Gaussian profiles are assumed for the wave
   function of the idler and signal light created in type-I spontaneous
   parametric down conversion. The distribution rates describe ellipses on
   the detection planes that are oriented at different angles according to
   the photon coincidences in either horizontal-horizontal,
   vertical-vertical, horizontal-vertical, or vertical-horizontal position
   variables. The predictions are in agreement with the experimental data
   obtained with a type-I beta-barium borate crystal that is illuminated by
   a 100-mW violet pump laser as well as with the results obtained from the
   geometry defined by the phase-matching conditions. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {We have performed a series of calculations of the electronic and

   functional theory and molecular dynamics. First we calculated basic
   parameters of the primitive crystalline cells to benchmark our results.
   Next, we worked with crystalline supercells in order to calculate the
   bandgap bowing parameter of the AlxGa1-xN alloy, which resulted in a
   value of 0.784 eV. Finally we studied the amorphous alloy a-AlxGa1-x
   with x = 0, 025, 0.5, 0.75, 1; we report radial distribution functions,
   density of states and bandgaps of the aforementioned systems. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Capsaicin is a potent inducer of apoptosis in tumourreceptor potential
   vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). The present study determined the IC50 and cytotoxic
   and apoptotic activities of the Capsaicin analogues Rinvanil and
   Phenylacetylrinvanil (PhAR) on three cervical cancer cell lines: HeLa,
   CaSKi and ViBo. These analogues possess an increased affinity for TRPV1
   receptors. The IC50 obtained proved to be cytotoxic for all three cell
   lines; however, in the cells treated with Capsaicin both active
   caspase-3 and nuclear fragmentation were present. Capsaicin and its
   analogues also inhibited the normal proliferation of lymphocytes,
   suggesting that they are non-selective antitumour compounds. Finally, we
   discuss the possible loss of the relation between apoptosis and affinity
   to TRPV1, and the need for other strategies to synthesise Capsaicin
   analogues that can be useful in cancer treatments. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Circadian regulation has a profound adaptive meaning in timing the best
   performance of biological functions in a cyclic niche. However, in
   cave-dwelling animals (troglobitic), a lack of photic cyclic environment
   may represent a disadvantage for persistence of circadian rhythms. There
   are different populations of cave-dwelling fish Astyanax mexicanus in
   caves of the Sierra El Abra, Mexico, with different evolutive history.
   In the present work, we report that fish collected from El Sotano la
   Tinaja show circadian rhythms of swimming activity in laboratory
   conditions. Rhythms observed in some of the organisms entrain to either
   continuous light-dark cycles or discrete skeleton photoperiods tested.
   Our results indicate that circadian rhythm of swimming activity and
   their ability to entrain in discrete and continuous photoperiods persist
   in some organisms that might represent one of the oldest populations of
   cave-dwelling A. mexicanus in the Sierra El Abra.},

Abstract = {Variations in progesterone (P-4) and testosterone (T) levels in the
   gonad of Octopus maya from Sisal in Yucatan State, Mexico, were
   investigated by radioimmunoassays and in relation to four gonad
   maturation stages (GMS) and to the reproductive cycle, as represented by
   two maturity indices (microscopic MiMI' and macroscopic MaMI').
   According to the GMS and the maturity indices, the reproductive season
   of O. maya from Yucatan occurred from February to June. In females, P-4
   and T displayed the same pattern, with a tendency to increase at the
   same time, although on average, P-4 had seven-fold higher concentrations
   than T. In contrast, P-4 and T in male gonads displayed a different
   pattern, where T concentrations were relatively stable throughout all of
   the study months. In the female gonad P-4 was lowest (close to 0pgg(-1))
   during both developing (GMS-I) and maturing (GMS-II) stages, and
   increased (189 +/- 53pgg(-1)) approaching the mature stage (GMS-III) to
   a maximum value of 611pgg(-1). Concentrations of T in the male gonad
   were lowest (106 +/- 9pgg(-1)) during the maturing stage (GMS-II) and
   increased up to the mature stage (GMS-III), reaching a maximum of
   440pgg(-1). Pearson's correlation (r) between hormones and maturity
   indices showed strong relationships for females (around 0.4 and -0.7;
   p<0.05), but there were negligible or weak relationships for males (0.2
   and -0.1; p>0.05). Hormone correlations in females were inverse with
   MaMI and direct with MiMI. Our major findings showed that gonadal P-4
   levels were elevated during GMS-III and GMS-IV (i.e. periods of
   vitellogenic oocytes), where the characteristic aspect is an ovary with
   very high oocyte diameters, with the primary follicle cells deeply
   infolded in the ooplasm for yolk synthesis. These results suggested a
   synchrony between P-4 and the process of folliculogenesis, and in turn,
   vitellogenesis.},

Abstract = {Eight cladid (Subclass Cladida) crinoids are described from the
   Carboniferous Ixtaltepec Formation of Oaxaca State, southern Mexico.
   Most of the material consists of external and internal moulds of cups,
   arms and the proximal parts of the stem. Ekteinocrinus mixteca sp. nov.
   is assigned to the Order Dendrocrinida; newly recognized taxa in the
   Order Poteriocrinida include Stipecrinus splendidus gen. et sp. nov.,
   Hydriocrinus amplus sp. nov. and Aesiocrinus profundus sp. nov.
   Cosmetocrinus sp., Contocrinus cf. kingi, an indeterminate
   Scytalocrinidae and a cup probably belonging to the Family
   Stellarocrinidae are also described. Stipecrinus splendidus sp. nov. and
   Cosmetocrinus sp. are Middle-Upper Mississippian (Visean-Serpukhovian),
   the other crinoids being Lower-Middle Pennsylvanian
   (Bashkirian-Moscovian). The present study reveals a strong similarity,
   expressed in terms of palaeobiodiversity, between the Oaxaca crinoids
   and those reported from Mississippian-Pennsylvanian faunas from the
   central-east region of North America. This similarity is also evident in
   the composition of the associated non-echinoderm
   fauna.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:347E74B9-82EB-49B8-BA1

Abstract = {The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a critically endangered and
   threatened species endemic of the Central Valley of Mexico. The
   population of this neotenic amphibian has declined in recent years as a
   result of habitat destruction, polluted waters, and the introduction of
   exotic species such as tilapia. We evaluated the antipredator response
   of predator-na < ve axolotls to visual and chemical cues of the Nile
   tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and its foraging consequences. Axolotls
   decreased their activity and increased their use of refuge in the
   presence of combined chemical and visual cues from the predator. The
   axolotls seem to use their vision to confirm the level of risk perceived
   through chemical signals to modulate their antipredator response
   accordingly. The axolotls engaged in prey capture at a similar rate
   independent of the type of predator exposure. However, the efficiency of
   prey capture decreased in axolotls exposed to the chemical and the
   combined visual and chemical cues from the tilapia. The foraging costs
   to the axolotls induced by tilapia can ultimately affect their growth
   rate and size. The axolotls display antipredator behaviours to reduce
   the risk of predation by tilapia, which is a primary condition of
   coexistence with this exotic predator.},

Title = {Hiding time of the hermit crab Calcinus californiensis:

Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Hermit crabs respond to predators by hiding in their shells. However,
   retraction may cause the crab to lose hold of the rock and fall through
   the water column, and the crab may land with the shell aperture in a
   different orientation. When the shell is aperture down, hermit crabs
   return to activity by moving their bodies forward and placing their legs
   on the ground. In contrast, when the shell is aperture up, crabs need to
   perform a righting maneuver by extending part of their bodies out of the
   shell, which makes them more vulnerable to predation. The main goal of
   this study was to examine the hiding time of the hermit crab Calcinus
   californiensis Bouvier, 1898 in different shell species under these two
   different situations to better understand the conflict between the cost
   of staying in hiding and the risk of predation. The study was conducted
   in rocky tide pools using seven different shell types that reflect
   different predator protection and resource value to the crab (based on
   previous studies). We measured the time required to perform the righting
   maneuver as a measure of the potential risk incurred when returning to
   activity. The hiding time with the shell aperture down was not affected
   by shell species. The requirement to carry out a righting maneuver
   lengthened the hiding time, which varied in the different shell species
   according to the time required to recover the natural position. The
   potential risks associated with the righting time, the protection
   offered by the shells, and the resource value played an important role
   in the hiding time of the crabs using different shells. This study shows
   that hermit crabs are aware of the attributes of the shell and use this
   information to make decisions about how long to stay hidden after being
   threatened.},

Abstract = {This academic essay is a historical, sociological and demographic study
   of student movements of 1968 and particularly of the Mexican student
   movement of that year. Historical and population behaviors it correlates
   with the events are given, and in this correlation plausible
   explanations for such events. It shows the development of the student
   movement just to the events of October 2 of that year and its
   dissolution. This essay concludes with the recognition of some
   influences that the movement has had on the political development of the
   Mexican nation, and finds some proposals made by the movement that have
   not been fulfilled yet forty-seven years later.},

Title = {Evolutionary biogeography of South American weevils of the tribe
   Naupactini (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1293-1304},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {AimNaupactini are highly diverse weevils, widespread in the Neotropical
   region. Their evolution may have been driven by geological and
   environmental changes. Our main goals were to explain the biotic
   diversification of this tribe in South America and to test previous
   hypotheses on the relationships between distribution areas.
   LocationNeotropical South America.
   MethodsWe compiled geographical records for 165 species of South
   American Naupactini. We then applied a track analysis and a parsimony
   analysis of paralogy-free subtrees to obtain generalized tracks and a
   general area cladogram, respectively.
   ResultsWe retrieved 11 generalized tracks that coincided broadly with
   biogeographical areas of Neotropical South America: Northern Venezuelan,
   Galapagos Islands, Ecuadorian, Yungas, Cerrado, Caatinga, Puna+Pacific
   coastal deserts, Chacoan, Atlantic+Parana forests, Monte and Pampean.
   The single general area cladogram obtained showed the following
   topology: ((Northern Venezuelan-Ecuadorian) (Galapagos
   Islands-Puna+Pacific coastal deserts) (Yungas (Cerrado (Monte (Pampean
   (Chacoan-Atlantic+Parana forests)))))).
   Main conclusionsThe general patterns identified agree with
   biogeographical provinces of modern regionalizations, assumed to have
   been caused by vicariance. These biogeographical units form two main
   components, one from north-western South America and the other from
   south-eastern South America, separated by the barrier of the Andean
   cordillera. The absence of other discernible geological barriers and the
   influence of the Plio-Pleistocene cycles make it difficult to elucidate
   the historical relationships between most forest areas and nearby open
   areas of South America. These observations indicate that the taxa under
   consideration underwent dispersal at different times, contributing to
   complex biogeographical patterns.},

Abstract = {Zinc and tin, together with Zn-Sn alloys are used in industrial
   operations and steel coatings against corrosion. One of its most common
   uses is the galvanizing process for outdoor structures, which is
   affected by corrosion caused by acid rain.
   The aim of the study is to evaluate the electrochemical behavior of
   Zn-Sn alloys with respect to pure metals, in an aqueous simulated acid
   rain solution consisting of 31.85 mg/L H2SO4, 15.75 mg/L HNO3, 21.25 mg
   /L NaNO3, 46.20 mg/L (NH4)(2)SO4, 31.95 mg/L Na2SO4, 84.85 mg/L NaCl, at
   a pH between 3,5 and 4,0, at room temperature (25 degrees C). Zn-Sn
   alloys samples were used with different percentages of tin (6 wt. \% Sn,
   10 wt. \% Sn and 50 wt. \% Sn), and pure metals samples. The samples
   were obtained by horizontal directional solidification.
   Samples of each of the revealed structures were taken and roughed with
   papers of SiC, of grain size between \# 60 and \# 1200. Subsequently,
   potentiodynamic polarization essays were performed in a conventional
   three electrode electrochemical cell and immersion tests. Each ones was
   examined by optical microscopy, before and after performing the tests.
   For cross sections of samples, in potentiodynamic curves was observed
   that increasing tin content in the alloy, the potential tend to nobler
   values. From immersion tests was observed that the columnar structure of
   zinc and alloys exhibit greater mass loss than other structures.
   Moreover, zinc and alloys have high corrosion rates on the first day of
   immersion, for all grain structures. The micrographs showed that zinc
   presents generalized corrosion.},

Abstract = {Oligacanthorhynchus (Rudolphi, 1819) Schmidt, 1972
   (Oligacanthorhynchidae) is a typical parasite of opossums (Didelphidae).
   This species of acanthocephalan exhibits a wide distributional range
   that extends from Brazil to as far north as the United States, but no
   data on the genetic divergence of this helminth has been provided thus
   far along its entire geographic range. The facts that O. microcephalus
   shows a relatively wide geographic range in Mexico and that it has been
   recorded in 3 species of opossum allowed us to conduct a molecular
   prospecting study to assess the genetic divergence among individuals and
   populations as well as to detect potentially exclusive lineages
   indicative of the presence of a species complex. In total, 81 specimens
   identified as O. microcephalus were collected from the intestines of 3
   species of opossum in 8 localities across central and southeastern
   Mexico. The DNA sequences of 2 genes were generated; cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) of the mitochondrial DNA and the domains D2
   and D3 from large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (LSU). Maximum
   parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses were
   performed for each dataset alone and for the combined datasets (LSU +
   cox 1). All the phylogenetic analyses yielded 3 major clades with high
   bootstrap and posterior probability support values and with relatively
   high genetic divergence levels for both markers. However, the
   morphological study of specimens through both light and scanning
   electron microscopy, as well as the morphometric data, indicate that
   those specimens allocated into Clade I are smaller than those contained
   in Clades II and III. Lower genetic divergence values, as well as no
   clear-cut morphometric differences, indicate that Clades II and III are
   likely not independent lineages. Our results show at least 2 genetic
   lineages that may represent independent species, but we refrain at the
   moment on describing a new species in the lack of evidence gathered from
   a wider geographic range.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances frequently exceed resilience of riparian
   forests. In small-scale restoration projects revegetation is a common
   technique, but its success depends on the plant species used and some
   environmental filters. We investigated whether grass competition and
   soil compaction together with seasonal drought and flooding limit the
   establishment of seven tree species experimentally planted in abandoned
   riparian pastures in Southern Mexico. We tested the effects of grass
   clearing and soil tilling and analyzed seasonal variation of vertical
   distance to water level, and changes in tree performance, microclimate,
   and vegetation biomass after planting. Seedling survival was low (19 +/-
   3 \%), ranging between 3 (Brosimum alicastrum, Moraceae) and 38 \%
   (Pachira aquatica, Bombacaceae). Survival was negatively correlated to
   vertical distance to water level, highlighting the importance of the
   short but severe dry season that may occur in the humid tropics, which
   reduced survival by > 60 \%. Flooding events also produced high seedling
   mortality (80 \% after the two first events). Clearing but not tilling
   enhanced seedling survival. Clearing also significantly increased
   seedling growth of some species, suggesting competition release. Tilling
   did not have any consistent effect on growth, but it appears to
   counteract the positive effects of clearing. Both pre-existing and
   planted trees ameliorated microclimate to produce better conditions for
   establishment of new trees following natural regeneration. We conclude
   that clearing can enhance seedling establishment in riparian abandoned
   tropical pastures, but other revegetation treatments intended to reduce
   soil drying and uprooting by flooding during early establishment should
   be evaluated to improve the cost-benefit of restoring riparian forest.},

Title = {Diversity, endemism and conservation of ferns (Polypodiales) in the
   Mexican Mountain Component},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {891-904},

Abstract = {We analyzed the distributional patterns of 95 selected species of
   leptosporangiate ferns inhabiting the Mexican Mountain Component, using
   grid-cells of one geographical degree as unit areas, applying endemism
   indices and richness and beta diversity analyses. Distributional data
   were obtained from several herbaria and specialized literature. Five
   grid-cells appear to be important for fern species richness, as they
   contain 35 to 49 species. These grid-cells are located in the Sierra
   Madre Oriental (SMO), Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and the Sierra
   Madre del Sur (SMS). Mean richness by latitudinal belts of one degree
   showed that the belts with highest values are related to the TMVB and
   SMS. A total of 13 grid-cells were recognized as important from the
   perspective of endemism; most of them are located also in the SMO, TMVB
   and SMS. The richest gridcells coincided with one of the main centres of
   endemism for ferns obtained in this study, located in the convergence of
   the southern part of the SMO, the eastern portion of the TMVB and the
   northern part of the SMS, reflecting the high humidity existing on the
   mountain slopes facing the Gulf of Mexico. Some important grid-cells
   recognized from richness and endemism analyses coincide with Mexican
   Natural Protected Areas. The beta diversity analysis showed a low degree
   of similarity among grid-cells, implying a high species replacement, as
   the result of environmental heterogeneity occurring in the Mexican
   mountain systems. On the other hand, the spatial analysis suggested a
   pattern of phytogeographical regionalization comprising two main areas:
   the Mexican Transition Zone and the Mexican Central Plateau. Ferns play
   an important role in the Mexican biodiversity and contributing to the
   beta diversity of Mexico.},

Abstract = {The mutational spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) in
   Mexico is unknown, although it has been suggested that PKU variants
   could have a differential geographical distribution. Genotype-phenotype
   correlations and genotype-based predictions of responsiveness to
   tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) have never been performed. We sequenced the
   PAH gene and determined the geographic origin of each allele,
   mini-haplotype associated, genotype-phenotype correlations and
   genotype-based prediction of BH4 responsiveness in 48 Mexican patients.
   The mutational spectrum included 34 variants with c.60+5G>T being the
   most frequent (20.8\%) and linked to haplotype 4.3 possibly because of a
   founder effect and/or genetic drift. Two new variants were found c.1A>T
   and c.969+6T>C. The genotype-phenotype correlation was concordant in
   70.8\%. The genotype-based prediction to BH4-responsiveness was 41.7\%,
   this information could be useful for the rational selection of
   candidates for BH4 testing and therapy.},

Title = {Successional dynamics in Neotropical forests are as uncertain as they

Abstract = {Although forest succession has traditionally been approached as a
   deterministic process, successional trajectories of vegetation change
   vary widely, even among nearby stands with similar environmental
   conditions and disturbance histories. Here, we provide the first
   attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify predictability and uncertainty
   during succession based on the most extensive long-term datasets ever
   assembled for Neotropical forests. We develop a novel approach that
   integrates deterministic and stochastic components into different
   candidate models describing the dynamical interactions among three
   widely used and interrelated forest attributes-stem density, basal area,
   and species density. Within each of the seven study sites, successional
   trajectories were highly idiosyncratic, even when controlling for prior
   land use, environment, and initial conditions in these attributes. Plot
   factors were far more important than stand age in explaining
   successional trajectories. For each site, the best-fit model was able to
   capture the complete set of time series in certain attributes only when
   both the deterministic and stochastic components were set to similar
   magnitudes. Surprisingly, predictability of stem density, basal area,
   and species density did not show consistent trends across attributes,
   study sites, or land use history, and was independent of plot size and
   time series length. The model developed here represents the best
   approach, to date, for characterizing autogenic successional dynamics
   and demonstrates the low predictability of successional trajectories.
   These high levels of uncertainty suggest that the impacts of allogenic
   factors on rates of change during tropical forest succession are far
   more pervasive than previously thought, challenging the way ecologists
   view and investigate forest regeneration.},

Abstract = {Rhinella rumbolli is a poorly known, medium-sized toad endemic to the
   Yungas of Argentina. Recent fieldwork allowed observing its peculiar
   oviposition mode, which is described in this paper. A review of
   literature and examination of museum material indicate that oviposition
   in Rhinella can vary from strings of eggs in a gelatinous tube
   (uniserial, biserial or multiserial) to open clumps. Clutch features in
   Rhinella provide informative variation for taxonomic and phylogenetic
   studies and help to understand the relationships in this large genus of
   true toads.},

Title = {Limitations of Climatic Data for Inferring Species Boundaries: Insights
   from Speckled Rattlesnakes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Phenotypes, DNA, and measures of ecological differences are widely used
   in species delimitation. Although rarely defined in such studies,
   ecological divergence is almost always approximated using multivariate
   climatic data associated with sets of specimens (i.e., the ``climatic
   niche{''}); the justification for this approach is that species-specific
   climatic envelopes act as surrogates for physiological tolerances. Using
   identical statistical procedures, we evaluated the usefulness and
   validity of the climate-as-proxy assumption by comparing performance of
   genetic (nDNA SNPs and mitochondrial DNA), phenotypic, and climatic data
   for objective species delimitation in the speckled rattlesnake (Crotalus
   mitchellii) complex. Ordination and clustering patterns were largely
   congruent among intrinsic (heritable) traits (nDNA, mtDNA, phenotype),
   and discordance is explained by biological processes (e.g., ontogeny,
   hybridization). In contrast, climatic data did not produce biologically
   meaningful clusters that were congruent with any intrinsic dataset, but
   rather corresponded to regional differences in atmospheric circulation
   and climate, indicating an absence of inherent taxonomic signal in these
   data. Surrogating climate for physiological tolerances adds artificial
   weight to evidence of species boundaries, as these data are irrelevant
   for that purpose. Based on the evidence from congruent clustering of
   intrinsic datasets, we recommend that three subspecies of C. mitchellii
   be recognized as species: C. angelensis, C. mitchellii, and C. Pyrrhus.},

Title = {Behavior of Early Warnings near the Critical Temperature in the
   Two-Dimensional Ising Model},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Among the properties that are common to complex systems, the presence of
   critical thresholds in the dynamics of the system is one of the most
   important. Recently, there has been interest in the universalities that
   occur in the behavior of systems near critical points. These universal
   properties make it possible to estimate how far a system is from a
   critical threshold. Several early-warning signals have been reported in
   time series representing systems near catastrophic shifts. The proper
   understanding of these early-warnings may allow the prediction and
   perhaps control of these dramatic shifts in a wide variety of systems.
   In this paper we analyze this universal behavior for a system that is a
   paradigm of phase transitions, the Ising model. We study the behavior of
   the early-warning signals and the way the temporal correlations of the
   system increase when the system is near the critical point.},

   particular, we find out the generalized Hamilton's equations,

   power law density distribution with respect to the standard contact
   volume form. Finally, we argue on the several possible applications of

Abstract = {Irreversible thermodynamics of single-molecule experiments subject to
   external constraining forces of a mechanical nature is presented.
   Extending Onsager's formalism to the nonlinear case of systems under
   nonequilibrium external constraints, we are able to calculate the
   entropy production and the general nonlinear kinetic equations for the
   variables involved. In particular, we analyze the case of RNA stretching
   protocols obtaining critical oscillations between different
   configurational states when forced by external means to remain in the
   unstable region of its free-energy landscape, as observed in
   experiments. We also calculate the entropy produced during these hopping
   events and show how resonant phenomena in stretching experiments of
   single RNA macromolecules may arise. We also calculate the hopping rates
   using Kramer's approach obtaining a good comparison with experiments.},

Abstract = {We report laboratory experiments on surface waves generated in a uniform
   fluid layer whose bottom undergoes an upward motion. Simultaneous
   measurements of the free-surface deformation and the fluid velocity
   field are focused on the role of the bottom kinematics (i.e. its
   spatio-temporal features) in wave generation. We observe that the fluid
   layer transfers bottom motion to the free surface as a temporal
   high-pass filter coupled with a spatial low-pass filter. Both filter
   effects are often neglected in tsunami warning systems, particularly in
   real-time forecast. Our results display good agreement with a prevailing
   linear theory without any parameter fitting. Based on our experimental
   findings, we provide a simple theoretical approach for modelling the
   rapid kinematics limit that is applicable even for initially non-flat
   bottoms: this may be a key step for more realistic varying bathymetry in
   tsunami scenarios.},

Abstract = {We study the dynamics of two kinds of entanglement and their interplay.
   On one hand, we consider the intrinsic entanglement within a central
   system composed of three two-level atoms and measured by multipartite
   concurrence; on the other, we consider the entanglement between the
   central system and a cavity, acting as an environment and measured with
   purity. Using dipole-dipole and Ising interactions between atoms, we
   propose two Hamiltonians: one homogeneous and one quasi-homogeneous. We
   find an upper bound for concurrence as a function of purity, associated
   with the evolution of the W state. A lower bound is also observed for
   the homogeneous case. In both situations, we show the existence of
   critical values of the interaction, for which the dynamics of
   entanglement seem complex.},

Title = {Gonadal morphogenesis and sex differentiation in the oviparous lizard,

Volume = {134},

Abstract = {Among reptiles, morphological events involving differentiation of the
   gonads are similar, and their development is closely related to
   development of the Wolffian and Mullerian reproductive ducts and adrenal
   tissue. These structures have been described for some Squamata during
   their embryonic development. This study shows morphological
   characteristics of gonadal, adrenal tissue, and reproductive ducts
   development, during the embryonic development of oviparous lizard
   Sceloporus aeneus. The morphology of the urogenital complexes was
   examined using light microscopy, and ultrastructure of gonads was
   analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The undifferentiated gonad
   was apparent from stage (st) 30 to st33; ovaries and testes became
   morphologically distinct from st34. In ovaries, the formation of the
   cortical and medullary region is evident, and germinal beds can be
   observed from st34 and synaptonemal complexes as evidence of meiosis was
   detected at st36. In testes, formation of testicular cords containing
   germ cells is observed; immature Leydig and Sertoli cells were
   identified from st38. Females showed evident Mullerian duct development,
   whereas in males, the Mullerian duct degenerated and the Wolffian duct
   remained. The adrenal tissue was observed as a cord of compact cells
   associated with the dorsal region of developing gonad from st31. In
   general, gonadal development of S. aeneus is similar to that observed in
   Sceloporus undulatus. Particularly, the presence of immature Leydig
   cells containing lipid droplets in testes and structures similar to
   germinal beds in ovaries is specific characteristics of S. aeneus.},

Abstract = {High-resolution sediment records from the eastern tropical North Pacific
   (ETNP) spanning the last similar to 240ka B.P. were studied to document
   the nature of millennial-scale climatic events in the tropical Pacific
   and to investigate teleconnection mechanisms. We present organic carbon
   (\%OC) and diffuse spectral reflectivity records as indicative of
   upwelling and productivity changes off NW Mexico over the middle to late
   Pleistocene. The new productivity records document the persistence of
   abrupt millennial-scale changes over the last two glacial cycles.
   Detailed spectral and wavelet time series analyses show the predominance
   of longer climatic cycles (2-6ka) during the last and the penultimate
   glacial periods. The persistence of millennial variability during the
   penultimate glacial, in absence of large ice rafted debris events in the
   North Atlantic, suggests that freshwater input through ice sheet
   dynamics is not essential for millennial-scale climate variability.
   Given the worldwide emerging picture of remarkable similar
   millennial-scale records over long time periods, we suggest that the
   pacing of this climate variability may represent a natural resonance in
   the climate system, amplified by a tightly coupled oceanic and
   atmospheric teleconnection processes. We present a schematic scenario of
   millennial-scale climate change depicting the role of the tropical
   Pacific in this global teleconnection system by linking productivity and
   upwelling changes in the ETNP with shifts in the position of the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone and the strength of the subtropical North
   Pacific High.},

Abstract = {The marine biota from the middle Pennsylvanian outcrops of the Sierra
   Agua Verde, located in mid-eastern Sonora, consists of phylloid algae of
   the genera Komia and Eugonophyllum and a number of invertebrates. These
   species include bioaccumulations of chaetetids; brachiopods of the
   genera Dielasma sp., Reticulariina sp., Anthracospirifer sp.,
   Antiquatonia sp.; bryozoans of the genus Thamniscus; tabulate corals
   such as Syringopora and solitary corals such as Zaphrentis; fusulinid
   foraminifera such as Pseudostaffella, Eoshubertella texana, Fusulinella
   llanoensis, and Zellerella; gastropods of the genus Euomphalus and
   Donaldina; and the crinoid genera Cyclocaudex, Cyclocrista,
   Heterosteleschus, Lamprosterigma, Mooreanteris, Pentagonopternix,
   Preptopremium, Cycloscaspus, and Pentaridica. The material was collected
   from outcrops in the first 512 m of the La Joya Formation, and their
   sediments have a total thickness of 780 m and consist of limestone
   interbedded with calcareous mudstone and sandstone lenses. The age of
   the middle Pennsylvanian strata corresponds to that of the Atokan stage
   (311 million years). The species assemblages are typical of a shallow
   tropical marine benthos. The analysis of the distribution of the species
   allowed for the determination of their paleogeographic relationships
   with the components of the biota of the Carboniferous strata of Texas
   and Kansas in the United States of America, which belong to the province
   of the North American Craton. All Rights Reserved (C) 2015 Universidad

Abstract = {Sperm competition studies typically identify copulation duration as an
   important predictor of paternity as it may determine the quantity of
   sperm transferred and thus paternity success. This study explores the
   relationship between copulation duration, male body size, male age and
   sperm transfer in the golden orb-weaving spider, Nephila edulis.
   Paternity in this species is strongly associated with the relative
   frequency and duration of copulation, which is also influenced by male
   size. We determined the number of sperm transferred during copulation,
   by performing sperm counts in both the male copulatory organs (palps)
   and female sperm receptacle (spermatheca) of recently mated pairs. The
   total number of sperm recorded (the sum in the male palps and female
   spermathecae) was greater for younger males than older males, but did
   not vary with male body size. In general, younger males transferred more
   sperm and a greater proportion of their sperm supplies than older males
   and, among these younger males, larger individuals transferred more
   sperm. However, there were no significant size effects for older males.
   More sperm was transferred with longer copulations, but in contrast with
   previous studies, we found that larger males copulated for longer. The
   rate of sperm transferred was negatively correlated with the duration of
   copulation, suggesting that the variation in copulation duration in
   N.edulis may represent strategic investment by males to alter patterns
   of paternity, in addition to transferring additional sperm.},

Title = {Biological potential of four indigenous tree species from seasonally dry
   tropical forest for soil restoration},

Abstract = {Litterfall and its subsequent decomposition in the soil are two
   essential ecosystem processes. In order to determine the biological
   potential of a species to aid soil restoration, it is necessary to
   evaluate litter production, its temporal variation, and rates of
   decomposition and nutrient cycling. In this study, we examined patterns
   of litterfall production, quality, and decomposition of two slow-growing
   (Crescentia alata and Eysenhardtia polystachya) and two fast-growing
   (Leucaena leucocephala and Pithecellobium dulce), multi-purpose
   indigenous species from seasonally dry tropical forest, in a 10-year-old
   plantation in Morelos, Mexico. Average litterfall was 7.82 +/- A 2.69 Mg
   ha(-1) year(-1) and varied significantly among species as follows: P.
   dulce > L. leucocephala > C. alata = E. polstachya. Leaf litter
   comprised the highest fraction in all species studied. In a litterbag
   experiment, all species had fast mass loss in the first 183 days of
   decomposition, coinciding with the rainy season. L. leucocephala had
   significantly higher decomposition than the other species. Nitrogen
   percentages increased significantly as decomposition progressed for all
   species except for E. polystachya while Carbon percentages during
   decomposition significantly decreased only in C. alata and L.
   leucocephala. C. alata had the highest average C/N ratio and L.
   leucocephala the lowest. We recommended for soil biological restoration,
   P. dulce because it is a fast-growing tree, with a rapid canopy closure
   and a high litter production and L. Leucocephala, which produces large
   amounts of rapidly decomposing mulch with high amount of nutrients,
   which can be rapidly released into the soil.},

Journal = {PHYSICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {90},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Polarized velocity selective spectra for rubidium atoms in a room
   temperature cell are presented. The experiments were performed in the
   lambda configuration (D2 manifold) and in the.. 5s -> 5p(3/2) -> 5d(j)
   ladder configuration. For the lambda configuration the effect of the
   probe beam intensity in the absorption and polarization spectra are
   compared with results of a rate equation approximation. Good overall
   agreement between experiment and theory is found. The results indicate
   different saturation rates for each of the atomic transitions.
   Distinctive polarization signals with hyperfine-resolved components are
   found for the ladder 5d(3/2) and 5d(5/2) upper states. Fluorescence
   detection of the 420 nm that results from the second step in the cascade
   decay 5d(j) -> 6p(j) -> 5s was used in the ladder experiments. This
   fluorescence was also used for the detection of the 5p(3/2) -> 6p(3/2)
   electric dipole forbidden transition in atomic rubidium that occurs at
   911 nm. The 6p(3/2) hyperfine structure was resolved in this continuous
   wave, non-dipole excitation.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The first public product of the Intergovernmental Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is its Conceptual Framework.
   This conceptual and analytical tool, presented here in detail, will
   underpin all IPBES functions and provide structure and comparability to
   the syntheses that IPBES will produce at different spatial scales, on
   different themes, and in different regions. Salient innovative aspects
   of the IPBES Conceptual Framework are its transparent and participatory
   construction process and its explicit consideration of diverse
   scientific disciplines, stakeholders, and knowledge systems, including
   indigenous and local knowledge. Because the focus on co-construction of
   integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives
   worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider
   research and knowledge-policy communities working on the links between
   nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists,
   policy-makers at different levels, and decision-makers in different
   sectors of society.},

Abstract = {In this paper pits, secondary wall, and pit membrane of tracheary
   elements of two species of Cactaceae with contrasting wood were
   characterized and compared. Mature plants of Echinocactus grusonii
   (dimorphic wood) and Mammillaria compressa (non-fibrous wood) belonging
   to the tribe Cacteae were collected and prepared using different methods
   to study them through photon, scanning electron, and transmission
   electron microscopy. Vessel elements have simple perforation plates with
   a border, as well as different degrees of secondary wall accumulation
   from annular to helical up to pseudoscalariform and alternate pits. In
   M. compressa secondary wall in some vessel elements may accumulate both
   annular and helical secondary wall. In E. grusonii pit membrane in the
   alternate pits of the vessel elements has very small pores, seen only at
   high magnification with electron microcopy. In fibers, we observed
   organelles, nucleus, and mitochondria, as well as an electron dense
   material; furthermore, the pits pair fiber-fiber has a small edge, seen
   with transmission electron microscopy, not described previously for the
   family. The pit membrane differences found between species may be
   related to their ability to avoid embolism, thus empiric research is
   needed to demonstrate it.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the species composition, richness, and total abundance of

   coral tissue and under turf algae using cores that were extracted at
   different distances (0.5, 2.5, and 7.0 cm) from both sides of the
   external coral tissue-turf algae competitive boundary. We found high
   endolith richness as never before reported for Orbicella species.
   Nineteen endolith taxa were found within the O. faveolata skeleton,
   seven below the coral tissue zone, and twelve exclusively below the turf
   algae zone. Significant differences existed in the community
   composition, species richness, and the total abundance of endoliths in
   the cores that were extracted from the turf algae zone compared with
   those of the coral tissue zone. The endolithic community composition and
   species richness changed abruptly across the coral-turf algae interface,
   forming a clear boundary between different endolithic communities just
   underneath the interface between the coral tissue and turf algae zones.},

Abstract = {We describe and compare the chorion of seven species of the genus
   Leptophobia (Butler, 1870): L. eleusis eleusis (Lucas, 1852); L. tovaria

   caesia (Lucas, 1852); L. eleone luca Fruhstorfer, 1907; L. philoma
   subargentea (Hewitson, 1870); and L. aripa elodia (Boisduval, 1836). The
   description and illustration consider the following structural features:
   number and arrangement of axes (short and long), quantification of ribs,
   and distinction of bulges along the perimicropylar region. We also
   describe the color and size (length and its ratio to the maximum
   diameter) of the egg. Three shapes of eggs are typical: oblong
   ellipsoidal, barrel, and obovate. We offer comparisons between
   characters belonging to different species; taxonomic and phylogenetic
   implications are discussed, given that chorion characters, wing
   patterns, and microhabitats of the imagos are mutually correlated.
   Altogether this leads us to acknowledging two subgroups within the genus
   (Klots's hypothesis).},

Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests are characterized by a high diversity of tree
   communities and extremely heterogeneous water availability. The tree
   Alvaradoa amorphoides is a pioneer species of the tropical dry forest
   found in Xochicalco, Morelos, Mexico. To determine the water
   requirements for this species to germinate, we evaluated the seed
   germination rates under field and laboratory conditions. In the field,
   the seeds had an overall mean germination rate of 42\%, but the rate
   varied between the different sites independent of the soil relative
   humidity and landscape. Alvaradoa amorphoides seeds exposed to a water
   potential of -0.5 MPa delayed germination, extending Phase II. At the
   -1.0 and -1.5 MPa water potentials, germination was inhibited by 80 and
   100\%, respectively, but the seeds remained viable. Although, the oxygen
   consumption did not differ between the treatments, the respiration
   profiles did not show the same triphasic curve as the control. The H2O2
   and O-2- levels were not significantly different in the seeds at the
   evaluated low-water potentials (-0.5 and -1.0 MPa), nor were the
   catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase activity. Only
   ascorbate peroxidase activity was inhibited at these two water
   potentials. Our data showed that the A. amorphoides seeds remained in
   phase II during low water potentials without high levels of Reactive
   Oxygen Species (ROS) {[}AR1] production and continued to be viable; this
   latter fact might explain the low influence of the humidity and
   landscape on the germination performance in the field.},

Title = {Is temperature conditioning Octopus maya fitness?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {467},
Pages = {71-76},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Temperature is a key factor that modulates Octopus maya reproduction.
   Evidence shows that wild females spawn when ambient natural temperatures
   are lower than 26 degrees C, caused by either the winter sea
   temperatures or the upwelling events. The upwelling determines the
   availability of cold and nutrient rich water during spring and summer in
   the northern side of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP). We determined the
   effects of ambient temperature on the reproductive performance of female
   Octopus maya maintained in thermal regimes that simulate (a) high summer
   temperature at the eastern side of the YP (31 degrees C), (b) winter
   temperature in all the YP (24 degrees C), and (c) a temperature decrease
   (TD) at a rate of 1 degrees C/5d from 31 to 24 degrees C. The number of
   spawns, eggs spawned by female, fertilization percentage, embryos
   development, and hatchlings survival after starvation were evaluated for
   each thermal regime. At 31 degrees C spawning of Octopus maya females is
   inhibited; only 13\% spawned. The few fertilized eggs spawned died after
   two 2 weeks, indicating that high temperatures are deleterious to
   embryos. Females exposed to temperature changes of 1 degrees C/5 d
   spawned only after temperature reached below 27 degrees C, 87\% of the
   females spawned. At the end TD treatment a mean value of 530 eggs per
   spawn was observed. Fertilization of spawns was around 50\%. All the
   females maintained at 24 degrees C spawned a mean of 1208 eggs/spawn
   with a 70.5\% fertilization rate. Embryonic development was interrupted
   early in TD treatments causing premature hatchlings by day 31. These
   premature juveniles showed smaller sizes and low survival (48\%) after a
   10-day fast. In contrast, embryos spawned at 24 degrees C exhibited
   larger development (45d), and hatchlings survival after a 10-day fast
   was 100\%. Our results explain why Octopus maya spawns are limited to
   winter in the western side of the YP, when temperatures drop due to
   polar winds. Results also highlight the importance of the Yucatan
   upwelling for maintaining suitable conditions for spawning, embryo
   development, and hatchling survival along the year at Eastern border of
   the YP. We consider that this species could be negatively affected if
   climate change leads to an ocean warming scenario. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Transient laminar opposing mixed convection in a gravity driven downward
   flow confined inside a vertical rectangular channel has been
   investigated, with both walls suddenly subjected to symmetrical
   isothermal heat sources over a finite portion of the channel walls. The
   unsteady two-dimensional Navier-Stokes and energy equations have been
   solved numerically for a wide parametric set. Studies are carried out
   for Reynolds numbers of 100 and 200 and several values of buoyancy
   strength or Richardson number. The effect of Reynolds number and
   opposing buoyancy on the temporal evolution of the overall flow
   structure, temperature field, and Nusselt number from the heated
   surfaces is investigated using fixed geometrical parameters and
   considering heat losses to the channel walls. In this parameter space,
   for a given Reynolds number and relatively small values of the buoyancy
   parameter, the transient process leads to a final symmetric or
   asymmetric steady-state. However, as the value of buoyancy strength
   increases, the flow and temperature fields become more complex and an
   oscillatory flow with a fundamental frequency sets in when a critical
   value of the Richardson number is reached. Numerical predictions show
   that the critical value of the Richardson number between the two regimes
   strongly depends on the value of the Reynolds number, and the time
   scales, natural frequencies, and phase-space portraits of flow
   oscillation are presented and discussed in detail. Stability of the
   symmetric response has been analyzed. The results include the effects of
   Prandtl number and heat losses to the channel walls on the evolution of
   the final flow and thermal responses. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {Diuretic and antiurolithiatic activities of hexane, chloroform, methanol
   and aqueous extracts of Parmentiera aculeata (Kunth) Seem.
   (Bignoniaceae) were evaluated. The formation of bladder stones was
   induced surgically placing a magnesium plate in male Wistar rats (250
   g). After 28 days the presence of bladder stones was corroborated by
   radiological plates. We performed a subchronic assay for 28 days and the
   animals were grouped as follow: water (control), positive control
   (furosemide, 0.25 mg(-1) kg(-1)) and 2 mL, each plant extract (70mg(-1)
   kg(-1) day(-1)). The values of water consumed and urine excreted at
   different times were significantly greater with furosemide, as well as
   they were in methanol and hexane extracts. In general, urine production
   correlated positively with increased water consumption. The chloroform
   extract induced the most weight of the bladder stones (P = 0.0228) and
   the mean stone weight of hexane, methanol and aqueous extracts respect
   to the negative control did not have significant differences. It was
   observed bladder stone fragmentation with hexane and methanol extracts;
   this is an important aspect that could facilitate its elimination
   through urine. These results confirm the use of P. aculeata in the folk
   medicine against urolithiasis.},

Abstract = {Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a worldwide pathogen with a broad host
   spectrum pathogenic to around 400 plant species. Sclerotia formed by S.
   sclerotiorum serve as resting structures that secure fungal survival in
   soil for prolonged periods in the absence of a host plant or may help to
   overcoming periods of unsuitable growth conditions. In the present
   study, the morphological development of sclerotia was examined by light
   and scanning electron microscopy of fungal microcultures. Observations
   from microscopy indicated that, during the first 4 days of culture, the
   sclerotial primordial originate by dichotomous branching of apical
   hyphae and from the 5th day mycelial clusters were also observed,
   indicating the initiation stage of sclerotia formation. From the 6th to
   the 8th day, sclerotia turned from white to dark color, and water drops
   (exudates) were observed on their surface. The process of sclerotia
   formation ended at the 9th day when they were easy to detach from the
   culture medium and had a black coloration. All the morphological
   processes involved in the formation of sclerotia by S. sclerotiorum were
   observed with both light and scanning electron microscopy.},

Abstract = {Organophosphate pesticides cause irreversible inhibition of AChE which
   leads to neuronal overstimulation and death. Thus, dogma indicates that
   the target of OP pesticides is AChE, but many authors postulate that
   these compounds also disturb cellular redox processes, and change the
   activities of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, it has also been
   reported that oxidative stress plays also a role in the regulation and
   activity of AChE. The aims of this study were to determine the effects
   of the antioxidant, vitamin C (VC), the oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide
   (tBOOH) and the organophosphate Chlorpyrifos (CPF), on AChE gene
   transcription and activity in zebrafish embryos after 72 h exposure. In
   addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring antioxidant
   enzymes activities and transcription, and quantification of total
   glutathione. Apical effects on the development of zebrafish embryos were
   also measured. With the exception of AChE inhibition and enhanced gene
   expression, limited effects of CPF on oxidative stress and apical
   endpoints were found at this developmental stage. Addition of VC had
   little effect on oxidative stress or AChE, but increased pericardial
   area and heartbeat rate through an unknown mechanism. TBOOH diminished
   AChE gene expression and activity, and caused oxidative stress when
   administered alone. However, in combination with CPF, only reductions in
   AChE activity were observed with no significant changes in oxidative
   stress suggesting the adverse apical endpoints in the embryos may have
   been due to AChE inhibition by CPF rather than oxidative stress. These
   results give additional evidence to support the role of prooxidants in
   AChE activity and expression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Theope Doubleday with 73 described taxa is one of the most diverse
   genera of Riodinidae. Some of these are rare and scarce in scientific
   collections because of their low population density and uncommon habits.
   That is the case of T. villai Beutelspacher, 1981, an endemic species of
   western Mexico that was described from just one specimen and little
   knowledge of its biology. Theope villai is present in semi-evergreen and
   cloud forests, apparently at clearly defined altitudes, in the
   midwestern region of Mexico. Based on a review of 28 specimens of T.
   villai from the main Mexican scientific collections and from recent
   field work, the morphological variation of the adults, ecological traits
   (microhabitat, seasonality, and vegetation), and distribution patterns
   are described. Differences were found between the holotype and the
   original description; these differences were not identified in
   subsequent reviews of the genus. As a unique characteristic within
   Theope, males of T. villai have modifications at the eighth tergite and
   sternite (saccus). Sexual dimorphism was found in the pattern,
   coloration, and size of the wings. Genitalia of both sexes share common
   characteristics with other species of the genus; this morphological data
   would help to elucidate interspecific relationships. Because of its
   rarity and pressure applied by land use of its habitat, policies should
   be considered to protect the species.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the dc electronic transport at zero temperature in
   aperiodic systems with macroscopic length is studied by using a
   real-space renormalization plus convolution method developed for the
   Kubo-Greenwood formula within the tight-binding formalism. We
   analytically prove the existence of transparent states in several
   generalized Fibonacci lattices, as well as in segmented linear chains,
   where they always appear if the number of bonds in each segment is even,
   regardless the ordering of segments. For two-dimensional square-lattice
   tapes with a periodic or non-periodic Fano-impurity plane, we found a
   novel ballistic transport state in the dc conductance spectra. (C) 2015

Title = {Confinement effects on an ultra-cold matter wave-packet by a square well
   impurity near the de-localization threshold: analytic solutions,
   scaling, and width properties},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D},

Abstract = {The determination of the maximum number of atoms and the density profile
   of an ultra-cold wave-packet, under confinement conditions by an
   attractive impurity near the de-localization threshold, have been an
   open problem in ultra-cold atom physics. In this work, we study the
   effect of a wave-guide impurity on an ultra-cold matter wave-packet at
   the threshold of de-localization. The impurity is modeled by a 1-D
   square well potential with depth V-0 and length 2R(0). Coupling of the
   square well potential to a contact impurity of strength beta at the
   center is also considered. The time-independent non-linear Schrodinger
   equation describing a Bose-Einstein condensate at the delocalization
   threshold is exactly solved. The density profile, maximum non-linear
   coupling constant, g(max), and maximum number of atoms, N-max, prompt to
   be localized by the defect potential in the ground and first excited
   states are also reported. It is shown that gmax and the density profiles
   become only functions of the reduced impurity size xi - root V0R0. It is
   also found that the first excited state at the threshold of
   de-localization exists only for xi >= pi/(2 root 2), always holding a
   lower number of atoms than the corresponding ground state for the same
   reduced impurity size. Also, the addition of a repulsive contact
   impurity leads to a non-linear coupling constant at the de-localization
   threshold lower than that of the square well potential. In spite of the
   non-linear character of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, it is found that
   a general scaling-law holds for defects with the same xi, related with
   the same g(max), having the same reduced density profile in the
   quasi-free direction. We report the full width at half maximum for the
   wave-function and density profile, finding a large spread for small
   reduced confining conditions. Implications of these results for the
   determination of the wave-packet properties under confinement in atom
   chip and Bose-Einstein condensates are presented with the aim to
   motivate further experimental work.},

Title = {Alternative kynurenic acid synthesis routes studied in the rat
   cerebellum},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Kynurenic acid (KYNA), an astrocyte-derived, endogenous antagonist of
   alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine and excitatory amino acid receptors,
   regulates glutamatergic, GABAergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic
   neurotransmission in several regions of the rodent brain. Synthesis of
   KYNA in the brain and elsewhere is generally attributed to the enzymatic
   conversion of L-kynurenine (L-KYN) by kynurenine aminotransferases
   (KATs). However, alternative routes, including KYNA formation from
   D-kynurenine (D-KYN) by D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) and the direct
   transformation of kynurenine to KYNA by reactive oxygen species (ROS),
   have been demonstrated in the rat brain. Using the rat cerebellum, a
   region of low KAT activity and high DAAO activity, the present
   experiments were designed to examine KYNA production from L-KYN or D-KYN
   by KAT and DAAO, respectively, and to investigate the effect of ROS on
   KYNA synthesis. In chemical combinatorial systems, both L-KYN and D-KYN
   interacted directly with peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and hydroxyl radicals (OH
   center dot), resulting in the formation of KYNA. In tissue homogenates,
   the non-specific KAT inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA; 1 mM) reduced
   KYNA production from L-KYN and D-KYN by 85.1 +/- 1.7\% and 27.1 +/-
   4.5\%, respectively. Addition of DAAO inhibitors (benzoic acid, kojic
   acid or 3-methylpyrazole5-carboxylic acid; 5 mu M each) attenuated KYNA
   formation from L-KYN and D-KYN by similar to 35\% and similar to 66\%,
   respectively. ONOO- (25 mu M) potentiated KYNA production from both
   L-KYN and D-KYN, and these effects were reduced by DAAO inhibition. AOAA
   attenuated KYNA production from L-KYN + ONOO- but not from D-KYN +
   ONOO-. In vivo, extracellular KYNA levels increased rapidly after
   perfusion of ONOO- and, more prominently, after subsequent perfusion
   with L-KYN or D-KYN (100 mu M). Taken together, these results suggest
   that different mechanisms are involved in KYNA production in the rat
   cerebellum, and that, specifically, DAAO and ROS can function as
   alternative routes for KYNA production.},

Abstract = {Soil fauna is essential for ecosystem dynamics as it is involved in
   biogeochemical processes, promotes nutrient availability, and affects
   the animal communities associated with plants. In this study, we examine
   the possible relationship between the soil micro-arthropod community on
   foliage production and quality of the shrub Pittocaulon praecox. We also
   examine the arthropods associated to its foliage, particularly the size
   of the main herbivores and of their natural enemies, at two sites with
   contrasting vegetation cover and productivity. The diversity of soil
   microarthropods was assessed from soil samples collected monthly under
   P. praecox individuals over 13 mo. Specimens collected were identified
   to species or morphospecies. Shrub foliage productivity was evaluated
   through the amount of litter produced. Resource quality was assessed by
   the mean content (percentage by weight) of N, C, S, and P of 30 leaves
   from each shrub. The mean size of herbivores and their natural enemies
   were determined by measuring 20 adult specimens of each of the most
   abundant species. We found a higher species richness of soil
   microarthropods and foliar arthropods in the open site, although the
   diversity of foliage arthropods was lower in the closed site. Shrubs
   growing in the closed site tend to produce more, larger, and
   nutritionally poorer (lower nitrogen content) leaves than open site.
   Herbivores and their natural enemies were also larger in the closed
   site. We found a significant positive relationship between the diversity
   and species richness of foliar arthropods and the nitrogen content of
   leaves. In general, species richness and diversity of both the foliar
   and soil fauna, as well as the size of organisms belonging to higher
   trophic levels, were affected by vegetation cover and primary
   productivity at each site. These findings highlight the need to
   simultaneously consider at least four trophic levels (soil organisms,
   plants, herbivores, and natural enemies) to better understand the
   functioning of these systems and their responses to environmental
   changes.},

Title = {Cultural significance of wild mammals in mayan and mestizo communities
   of the Lacandon Rainforest, Chiapas, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: Several ethnobiology studies evaluate the cultural
   significance (CS) of plants and mushrooms. However, this is not the case
   for mammals. It is important to make studies of CS allowing the
   comparison of cultural groups because the value given to groups of
   organisms may be based on different criteria. Such information would be
   valuable for wildlife preservation plans. In this study, the most
   culturally significant species of mammals from the Lacandon Rainforest
   (Chiapas, Mexico) for people from two Mayan-Lacandon and mestizo
   communities were identified. The reasons behind the CS of the studied
   species were explored and the existence of differences among the
   cultural groups was evaluated.
   Methods: One hundred ninety-eight semi-structured and structured
   interviews were applied to compile socio-demographic information,
   qualitative data on CS categories, and free listings. Frequency of
   mention was a relative indicator to evaluate the CS of each species of
   mammal. Comparison of responses between communities was carried out
   through multivariate analyses. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test
   was used to compare the number of mentioned species by Lacandons and
   mestizos as well as different responses in the qualitative categories. A
   chi 2 test was used to compare frequency of categories.
   Results: 38 wild mammal species were identified. The classification and
   Principal Components Analyses show an apparent separation between
   Lacandon and mestizo sites based on the relative importance of species.
   All four communities mentioned the lowland paca the most, followed by
   peccary, white-tailed deer, armadillo, and jaguar. No significant
   difference was found in the number of mentioned species between the two
   groups. Eight CS categories were identified. The most important category
   was ``harmful mammals{''}, which included 28 species. Other relevant
   categories were edible, medicinal, and appearing in narratives.
   Conclusions: The data obtained in this study demonstrates the existence
   of differential cultural patterns in the relationships that Lacandon and
   mestizo groups establish with mammals. Species are deemed important
   either because they are eaten of because of the harm they cause. We
   suggest the incorporation of local conceptions about wild animals in
   conservation frameworks for the fauna in the Lacandon Rainforest.},

Abstract = {The surface enhanced raman scattering (SERS) signal from the L-tyrosine
   (tyr) molecule adsorbed on gold nanoparticles (Au-tyr) is compared with
   the SERS signal assisted by the presence of gadolinium ions (Gd3+)
   coordinated with the Au-tyr system. An enhancement factor of the SERS
   signal in the presence of Gd3+ ions was similar to 5 times higher than
   that produced by L-tyrosine adsorbed on gold nanoparticles. The
   enhancement of the SERS signal. can be attributed to a corresponding
   increase in the local electric field due to the presence of Gd3+ ions in
   the vicinity of a gold dimer configuration. This scenario was confirmed
   by solving numerically Maxwell equations, showing an increase of 1 order
   of magnitude in the local electric scattered field when the Gd3+ ion is
   located in between a gold dimer compared With naked gold nanopartides.},

   species could have a cohesive role in the flock, but almost all of them
   were different among localities. The number of species per mixed flock
   varied from two to 30. The mean number of species per flock also varied
   among localities, and the differences among the whole set of species
   joining mixed flocks in each locality seem to be related with both

Title = {Levy walks on lattices as multi-state processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT},
Year = {2015},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Continuous-time random walks combining diffusive scattering and
   ballistic propagation on lattices model a class of Levy walks. The
   assumption that transitions in the scattering phase occur with
   exponentially-distributed waiting times leads to a description of the
   process in terms of multiple states, whose distributions evolve
   according to a set of delay differential equations, amenable to analytic
   treatment. We obtain an exact expression of the mean squared
   displacement associated with such processes and discuss the emergence of
   asymptotic scaling laws in regimes of diffusive and superdiffusive
   (subballistic) transport, emphasizing, in the latter case, the effect of
   initial conditions on the transport coefficients. Of particular interest
   is the case of rare ballistic propagation, in which a regime of
   superdiffusion may lurk underneath one of normal diffusion.},

Abstract = {In this work, high-pressure electrical resistivity measurements and

   presented. Electrical resistivity measurements up to about 5 GPa using a
   diamond anvil cell on MoBC revealed that decreases in a non-monotonic
   way. Using Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method based on Density
   Functional Theory, we investigate the changes in the electronic
   structure of this compound as a function of pressure. The states at the
   Fermi level mainly come from the d orbitals of molybdenum atoms. As the
   pressure increases, the band width is enhanced and the total density of
   states at the Fermi level decreases. The Fermi surface for this compound
   possesses a two-dimensional character which prevails under an applied
   pressure of about 10 GPa. The results are compared with the chemical
   pressure effects on induced by the gradual and non-simultaneous
   elimination of B and C in the compound.},

Abstract = {Floral nectaries are essential for plant reproduction. Their position
   and shape are important because these factors determine the amount of
   nectar secreted and therefore the pollinators that are attracted. The
   main objective of this study is to determine the position, shape and
   macromorphology of floral nectaries for three columnar cacti, namely
   Polaskia chende, P. chichipe and Stenocereus quevedonis. By means of
   light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and histochemical tests,
   the floral nectar-secreting structures were investigated. Different
   secreting structures were found for the three species, with S.
   quevedonis having the largest nectar secreting area consisting of
   stomates located at the base of the stem filaments (1.9 mm(2)). The
   nectar secretory pores of P. chichipe measured 0.93 mm2, while the
   cuticular fissures of P. chende measured 0.8 mm(2). For the case of
   these three species, the surface available for nectar secretion appears
   to determine the volume of nectar secretion. The relationships between
   nectarial chamber size, total nectar volume secreted and size of
   secreting structure found for the three species suggest that the surface
   area available is the central influential variable that determines the
   volume of secreted nectar.},

Title = {Numerical study on buoyancy and inclination effects on transient laminar
   opposing mixed convection in rectangular channels with symmetric and
   discrete heating},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {766-785},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Detailed numerical simulations are carried out for transient laminar
   opposing mixed convection in a rectangular inclined channel with both
   walls suddenly subjected to discrete isothermal flush-mounted heat
   sources simulating electronic components. Using the vorticity-stream
   function formulation of the unsteady two-dimensional Navier-Stokes and
   energy equations, the governing equations are solved numerically using
   the control volume method. Simulations are performed for fixed values of
   the geometrical parameters, Reynolds number of Re= 500, Prandtl number
   of Pr= 7 and channel inclination of 0 degrees <= gamma <= 90 degrees.
   Results illustrate the effects of buoyancy strength or Richardson number
   Ri = Gr/Re-2 and channel inclination angle on the overall flow structure
   and nondimensional heat flux (Nusselt number) from the heated slabs. It
   is found that for the horizontal configuration (gamma = 0 degrees), due
   to the indirect effect of buoyancy, much higher threshold values of
   buoyancy strength are required for the appearance of the recirculation
   flows that take place downstream of the heated slabs. However, for
   increasing values of the inclination angle, vortex migration to higher
   positions inside the channel occurs and higher heat transfer rates are
   obtained. In addition, transition from steady to time-periodic flow
   takes place for values of the buoyancy parameter larger than a critical
   one, and the threshold value between the two regimes strongly depends on
   the value of the Reynolds number and channel orientation. The results
   include the effects of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers along with heat
   losses to the channel walls on the evolution of the final flow and
   thermal response. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Here, we analyzed the effects of testosterone (T) and its metabolites,
   estradiol (E-2) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on the onset of paternal
   behavior in virgin male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). We
   hypothesized that T and E-2, but not DHT, would facilitate the onset of
   patemal behavior. Seventy males displaying aggression toward pups were
   selected through a paternal behavior screening test Forty males were
   bilaterally castrated. Of them, 10 were implanted with T, 10 with E-2,
   and 10 with DHT, and 10 received no treatment. Another 30 males
   underwent a sham procedure. In these gerbils, T, E-2 and DHT were
   measured to obtain the basal levels of these hormones. After treatment
   the paternal behavior test was conducted again. Blood samples were
   obtained immediately after the administration of the test for the
   quantification of T, E-2 and DHT by radioimmunoassay. Surprisingly,
   100\% of the males that received T, E-2 and DHT implants stopped being
   aggressive and became paternal. Castrated and sham-operated males
   displayed no changes in their aggressive behaviors. This is the first
   report that T and its metabolites are involved in neuroendocrine
   mechanisms that inhibit aggression toward pups and facilitate paternal
   behavior in virgin male Mongolian gerbils. In addition, this is the
   first report of regulation of paternal behavior in a rodent by
   estrogenic and androgenic pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights

   change versus climate drivers},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Numerous climate change effects on biodiversity have been anticipated
   and documented, including extinctions, range shifts, phenological
   shifts, and breakdown of interactions in ecological communities, yet the
   relative balance of different climate drivers and their relationships to
   other agents of global change (for example, land use and landuse change)
   remains relatively poorly understood. This study integrated historical
   and current biodiversity data on distributions of 115 Mexican endemic
   bird species to document areas of concentrated gains and losses of
   species in local communities, and then related those changes to climate
   and land-use drivers. Of all drivers examined, at this relatively coarse
   spatial resolution, only temperature change had significant impacts on
   avifaunal turnover; neither precipitation change nor human impact on
   landscapes had detectable effects. This study, conducted across species'
   geographic distributions, and covering all of Mexico, thanks to two
   large-scale biodiversity data sets, could discern relative importance of
   specific climatic drivers of biodiversity change.},

Abstract = {Personal care products have been detected in superficial waters,
   representing an environmental risk to the biota. Some studies indicated
   that 3-benzophenone (3BP) alters hormones, inducing vitellogenesis and
   having adverse effects on fish reproduction. Other studies have reported
   generation of free radicals and changes in antioxidant enzymes.
   Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test acute exposure to
   3BP at concentrations within and beyond that found environmentally to
   provide important toxicological information regarding this chemical. We
   evaluated the effect of 3BP on vitellogenin 1 (VTG1) gene expression and
   the transcription of the enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) or glutathione peroxidase (GPx), which are involved in cellular
   redox balance. Zebrafish eluthero-embryos (168 hpf) were exposed to
   1,10, 100, 1000 mu g/L 3BP, in addition to a negative control and a
   0.1\% ethanol control for 48 h. The results of our study indicated a
   positive significant correlation between exposure concentrations and
   VTG1 expression (r=0.986, p=0.0028) but only 1000 mu g/L 3BP produced a
   significant increase from control. Acute exposure showed no significant
   differences in transcription levels of CAT, SOD or GPx at the tested
   conditions. Nevertheless, a trend toward increase in GPx expression was
   observed as a positive significant correlation (r=0.928, p=0.017) was
   noted. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Global plant trait studies have revealed fundamental trade-offs in plant
   resource economics. We evaluated such trait trade-offs during secondary
   succession in two species-rich tropical ecosystems that contrast in
   precipitation: dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico.
   Species turnover with succession in dry forest largely relates to
   increasing water availability and in wet forest to decreasing light
   availability. We hypothesized that while functional trait trade-offs are
   similar in the two forest systems, the successful plant strategies in
   these communities will be different, as contrasting filters affect
   species turnover. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest
   sites (5-63 years after abandonment) and in 17 wet secondary forest
   sites (<1-25 years after abandonment). We used 11 functional traits
   measured on 132 species to make species-trait PCA biplots for dry and
   wet forest and compare trait trade-offs. We evaluated whether
   multivariate plant strategies changed during succession, by calculating
   a `Community-Weighted Mean' plant strategy, based on species scores on
   the first two PCA-axes. Trait spectra reflected two main trade-off axes
   that were similar for dry and wet forest species: acquisitive versus
   conservative species, and drought avoiding species versus evergreen
   species with large animal-dispersed seeds. These trait associations were
   consistent when accounting for evolutionary history. Successional
   changes in the most successful plant strategies reflected different
   functional trait spectra depending on the forest type. In dry forest the
   community changed from having drought avoiding strategies early in
   succession to increased abundance of evergreen strategies with larger
   seeds late in succession. In wet forest the community changed from
   species having mainly acquisitive strategies to those with more
   conservative strategies during succession. These strategy changes were
   explained by increasing water availability during dry forest succession
   and increasing light scarcity during wet forest succession. Although
   similar trait spectra were observed among dry and wet secondary forest
   species, the consequences for succession were different resulting from
   contrasting environmental filters.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) in the
   equation of state (EOS) of a system of charged fermions at finite
   density in the presence of a magnetic field. In the region of strong
   magnetic fields (eB > m(2)), the AMM is found from the one-loop fermion
   self-energy. In contrast to the weak-field AMM found by Schwinger, in
   the strong magnetic field region the AMM depends on the Landau level and
   decreases with it. The effects of the AMM in the EOS of a dense medium
   are investigated at strong and weak fields using the appropriate AMM
   expression for each case. In contrast with what has been reported in
   other works, we find that the AMM of charged fermions makes no
   significant contribution to the EOS at any field value.},

Title = {Rank Diversity of Languages: Generic Behavior in Computational
   Linguistics},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Statistical studies of languages have focused on the rank-frequency
   distribution of words. Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word
   ranks change in time and call this distribution rank diversity. We
   calculate this diversity for books published in six European languages
   since 1800, and find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution.
   Based on the mean and standard deviation associated with the lognormal
   distribution, we define three different word regimes of languages:
   ``heads{''} consist of words which almost do not change their rank in
   time, ``bodies{''} are words of general use, while ``tails{''} are
   comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in
   time. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified
   by linguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk
   model which reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the
   diversity. Rank diversity of words can be understood as the result of
   random variations in rank, where the size of the variation depends on
   the rank itself. We find that the core size is similar for all languages
   studied.},

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {282},
Number = {1804},

Abstract = {Scorpions represent an iconic lineage of arthropods, historically
   renowned for their unique bauplan, ancient fossil record and venom
   potency. Yet, higher level relationships of scorpions, based exclusively
   on morphology, remain virtually untested, and no multilocus molecular
   phylogeny has been deployed heretofore towards assessing the basal tree
   topology. We applied a phylogenomic assessment to resolve scorpion
   phylogeny, for the first time, to our knowledge, sampling extensive
   molecular sequence data from all superfamilies and examining basal
   relationships with up to 5025 genes. Analyses of supermatrices as well
   as species tree approaches converged upon a robust basal topology of
   scorpions that is entirely at odds with traditional systematics and
   controverts previous understanding of scorpion evolutionary history. All
   analyses unanimously support a single origin of katoikogenic
   development, a form of parental investment wherein embryos are nurtured
   by direct connections to the parent's digestive system. Based on the
   phylogeny obtained herein, we propose the following systematic
   emendations: Caraboctonidae is transferred to Chactoidea new
   superfamilial assignment; superfamily Bothriuroidea revalidated is
   resurrected and Bothriuridae transferred therein; and Chaerilida and
   Pseudochactida are synonymized with Buthida new parvordinal synonymies.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests are vulnerable to long term changes of temperature and
   precipitation. In this study, we want to know if the precipitation
   regime significantly varies among years and seasons during a five-yr
   period (2006-2010) at the North of Laguna de Terminos, Campeche, Mexico.
   In addition, we want to know how the salinity and the redox potential of
   the ground water of a monospecific mangrove forest of Rhizophora mangle
   are modified according to this variation. Finally, we describe the total
   litterfall, and the flowers and hypocotiles production of the studied
   mangrove and analyze these responses as a function of the environment
   variables. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that precipitation
   significantly varied among years and seasons (F=15.83, p<0.003; F=29.8,
   p<0.0001). The salinity and the redox potential were also significant
   effects of the same temporal variation (F=1003.25, p<0.0001; F=213.32,
   p<0.0001), as well as the total litter-fall and the hypocotile
   production (F=39.35, p<0.001; F=8.74, p<0.025). Precipitation was
   directly proportional to the hypocotile production (r=0.43, p<0.005) and
   inversely proportional to the salinity ground water (r= - 0.36, p<0.02).
   The precipitation and the salinity play significant roles on the
   variation of the litter-fall and the hypocotile production of the
   studied mangrove (R-2= 0.85; p<0.05 and R-2= 0.70; p<0.05). Our study
   suggests a resilient ability of R. mangle, which allows it to tolerate
   seasonal and annual changes of the precipitation.},

Abstract = {Autophagy is a critical cellular homeostatic process that controls the
   turnover of damaged organelles and proteins. Impaired autophagic
   activity is involved in a number of diseases, including idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis suggesting that altered autophagy may contribute to
   fibrogenesis. However, the specific role of autophagy in lung fibrosis
   is still undefined. In this study, we show for the first time, how
   autophagy disruption contributes to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in
   vivo using an Atg4b-deficient mouse as a model. Atg4b-deficient mice
   displayed a significantly higher inflammatory response at 7 d after
   bleomycin treatment associated with increased neutrophilic infiltration
   and significant alterations in proinflammatory cytokines. Likewise, we
   found that Atg4b disruption resulted in augmented apoptosis affecting
   predominantly alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells. At 28 d
   post-bleomycin instillation Atg4b-deficient mice exhibited more
   extensive and severe fibrosis with increased collagen accumulation and
   deregulated extracellular matrix-related gene expression. Together, our
   findings indicate that the ATG4B protease and autophagy play a crucial
   role protecting epithelial cells against bleomycin-induced stress and
   apoptosis, and in the regulation of the inflammatory and fibrotic
   responses.},

Abstract = {Although neglected for a long time by freshwater-ecology research,
   springs are very important habitats for biodiversity conservation. They
   are multiple ecotones, and are characterized by a remarkable variety of
   environmental conditions (e.g., from highly-shaded to UV exposed, from
   permanent discharge to intermittent flow, from still water to strong
   currents, from extremely-soft to carbonate-precipitating water, etc.).
   Moreover, springs are often amongst the last high-integrity,
   oligotrophic freshwater habitats in densely populated areas. Because of
   the high quality of their waters, the main impact affecting springs is
   capturing and water diversion. Climate-change driven reduction in
   precipitations in many areas is likely to determine an aggravation of
   this impact. It is thus important to document the rich and peculiar
   biodiversity of springs, also to establish reference conditions for
   bioassessment methods. Especially in non-acidic springs with running
   water, and coarse lithic substrata, cyanobacteria are often one of the
   most taxa-rich and abundant groups of photoautotrophs. The
   relatively-scarce information available in the literature is mostly
   referred to similar habitats, and not to spring habitats in the narrower
   sense. Papers dealing with the cyanobacteria of ambient springheads
   (=eucrenal) worldwide are still very rare. These were reviewed

Abstract = {We sketch the generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) formalism of
   a ternary boson-fermion (BF) model to study the critical transition
   temperature T (c) of a superconductor. This ternary model contrasts with
   the more familiar binary models of, e.g., Eagles, Ranninger et al., T.D.
   Lee et al., etc. The fermions are unpaired electrons (e) or, without
   loss of generality, holes (h); the bosons are Cooper pairs (CPs) each of
   both these fermions. In essence, the GBEC is a statistical model, as is
   the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory also, and yields three
   condensed chemically- and thermodynamically-stable phases: two pure
   phases, one for electron Cooper pairs (2e-CPs), and the other for hole
   Cooper pairs (2h-CPs), along with a mixed phase in arbitrary proportions
   of each of the two pure phases. The explicit inclusion of 2h-CPs
   dramatically increases the T (c) of a superconductor with respect to BCS
   besides including as special cases all known statistical models of
   superconductors.},

Abstract = {Interspecific gene flow is pervasive throughout the tree of life.
   Although detecting gene flow between populations has been facilitated by
   new analytical approaches, determining the timing and geography of
   hybridization has remained difficult, particularly for historical gene
   flow. A geographically explicit phylogenetic approach is needed to
   determine the overlap of ancestral populations. In this study, we
   performed population genetic analyses, species delimitation, simulations
   and a recently developed approach of species tree diffusion to infer the
   phylogeographic history, timing and geographic extent of gene flow in
   lizards of the Sceloporus spinosus group. The two species in this group,
   S.spinosus and S.horridus, are distributed in eastern and western
   portions of Mexico, respectively, but populations of these species are
   sympatric in the southern Mexican highlands. We generated data
   consisting of three mitochondrial genes and eight nuclear loci for 148
   and 68 individuals, respectively. We delimited six lineages in this
   group, but found strong evidence of mito-nuclear discordance in
   sympatric populations of S.spinosus and S.horridus owing to
   mitochondrial introgression. We used coalescent simulations to
   differentiate ancestral gene flow from secondary contact, but found
   mixed support for these two models. Bayesian phylogeography indicated
   more than 60\% range overlap between ancestral S.spinosus and S.horridus
   populations since the time of their divergence. Isolation-migration
   analyses, however, revealed near-zero levels of gene flow between these
   ancestral populations. Interpreting results from both simulations and
   empirical data indicate that despite a long history of sympatry among
   these two species, gene flow in this group has only recently occurred.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to measure the impact of active orthostatism
   and hemodialysis (HD) upon heart rate variability (HRV) in chronic renal
   failure (CRF) patients before and after HD.
   Nineteen healthy subjects (age 27 +/- A 8 years old, 13 were female) and
   19 unmedicated CRF patients with HD thrice per week (average HD vintage
   = 12 months, age 32 +/- A 9 years old, 11 were female) were included.
   Five-minute length HRV time series were obtained during supine position
   and orthostatism. Recordings from CRF patients were obtained before and
   after HD. Time domain and frequency domain HRV indexes were compared by
   analysis of variance. The correlation between each HRV index and change
   in sympathetic weighting induced by different maneuvers was tested by
   Kendall's Tau correlation. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically
   significant.
   HRV indexes which are associated with sympathetic activity increased in
   response to orthostatism in the healthy group, e.g., low-frequency to
   high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio, Ln (LF/HF) = -0.3 +/- A 0.9 versus 0.9 +/-
   A 0.9. CRF patients before HD had higher sympathetic weighting than
   healthy participants, even in supine position, Ln (LF/HF) = 0.6 +/- A
   1.0, but such a difference was accentuated during orthostatism, Ln
   (LF/HF) = 1.5 +/- A 1.0, and after HD: Ln (LF/HF) = 0.8 +/- A 1.3
   (supine position) and 2.5 +/- A 2.1 (orthostatism). All HRV indexes were
   associated with increments in sympathetic weighting between maneuvers
   (KendallA ` s correlations absolute values a parts per thousand
   yen0.24).
   Unmedicated young CRF patients treated with hemodynamically stable
   maintenance HD showed preserved capacity of autonomic response (with
   gradual sympathetic increases) induced by cardiovascular challenges such
   as orthostatism and HD.},

Title = {Evolving from static to dynamic signals: evolutionary compensation
   between two communicative signals},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {223-229},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Signals that convey related information may impose selection on each
   other, creating evolutionary links between different components of the
   communicative repertoire. Here, we ask about the consequences of the
   evolutionary loss of one signal (a colour patch) on another (a motion
   display) in Sceloporus lizards. We present data on male lizards of four
   species: two pairs of sister taxa representing two independent
   evolutionary losses of the static colour patch (Sceloporus cozumelae and
   Sceloporus parvus; Sceloporus siniferus and Sceloporus merriami). Males
   of the two species that have undergone an evolutionary loss of
   blue-belly patches (S. cozumelae, S. siniferus) were less active than
   their blue-bellied sister taxa (S. parvus, S. merriami), consistent with
   the suggestion that the belly patches were lost to reduce
   conspicuousness of species with high predation pressure. In contrast,
   the headbob display appears to have become more, rather than less,
   conspicuous over evolutionary time. The colour patch is exhibited
   primarily during aggressive encounters, whereas headbob displays are
   multifunction signals used in several different contexts, including
   aggressive encounters. Males of species that have lost the colour patch
   produced more motion displays, and the structure of those motion
   displays were more similar to those produced during combat. In both
   evolutionary episodes, a static colour signal appears to have been
   replaced by dynamic motion displays that can be turned off in the
   presence of predators and other unwanted receivers. The predominant
   pattern is one of evolutionary compensation and interactions between
   multiple signals that convey related information. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {We studied the responses of soil microbial biomass, respiration and
   enzyme activities to temperature in three Mexican soils. Soils were
   incubated at temperature range of 15-550 A degrees C at 50 (wet) and 10
   \% (dry) of their water holding capacity. Soils were assayed for their
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, CO2-C evolution and acid and
   alkaline phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, beta-glucosidase,
   urease, and protease activities. Thermal responses of soil enzyme
   activities were fitted to both the equilibrium model (EM) and the
   classical Q(10) model to describe the effects of temperature on enzyme
   activity. Total organic C, Fe speciation, available P, and inorganic N
   contents were also determined in all soils and at all temperatures. The
   results showed that the ATP content, CO2-C evolution, and enzyme
   activities of soil increased within the temperature range 15-65 A
   degrees C, and at higher temperatures, soil enzyme activities were more
   resistant than the ATP content and CO2-C evolution. The effects of
   temperature were more drastic in wet than in dry soil, although the two
   soil series displayed similar trends. The enzyme activities showed a
   good fit to the EM, making this model suitable for determining
   activation energy, enthalpy of inactivation, and equilibrium
   inactivation temperatures of soil enzymatic reactions. The results of
   the EM indicated that soil chemical parameters may not affect the
   activation energy of enzyme reactions, but may influence the enzyme
   resistance to inactivation at higher temperature. The results also
   indicated that the EM model can be used for predicting the impact of
   high temperatures on soil enzyme activities.},

Abstract = {The patterns of geographic differentiation in fern species have been
   linked to climatic differences across regions and the distribution of
   available habitat. In this paper, the association between some climatic
   features and patterns of geographic differentiation in American tree
   ferns was evaluated. For this, the occurrence ranges of 190 species were
   plotted and then analysed using track analysis. Here we identify six
   generalised tracks that span the main highland regions of tropical
   America: the Andes, the Guyana Highlands, the Brazilian Atlantic coast,
   lower Central America, the Greater Antilles, and upper Central
   America-Mexico. We did not find an association between cloud forest
   habitat and the differentiation pattern revealed by generalised tracks
   in Central America. Instead, these patterns are congruent with
   well-documented geological boundaries in the region. Climatic variables
   associated with cloud forest habitat were extracted from each
   generalised track and subjected to ANOVA, showing that most tracks have
   equivalent climates. The Andean track showed significant climatic
   differences with the Brazilian and Guyanan tracks, which were associated
   with main habitat discontinuities. From these results, we propose that
   historical isolation has been important in promoting geographical
   differentiation in tree ferns and that differentiation by dispersal
   cannot fully explain the large-scale geographical patterns observed in
   tree ferns.},

Abstract = {Thinning has technical and economic implications for both, forest
   production and industrial activity. The aim of this study was to
   determine the effect of thinning intensity on the anatomical properties
   of pine wood. Samples were taken at 1.30 m height, from 24 Pinus taeda
   trees of 20 years old, coming from a thinning treatment. The plantation
   was intervened at 3 years, with removal of 0\%, 50\%, 75\% and 87,5\% of
   the trees from the initial density (1960 trees/ha). The evaluated
   variables were: diameter at breast height, total height, diameter on the
   base of the live crown, height at base of live crown, tracheid length,
   cell wall thickness and microfibril angle. The tracheid length was
   higher in 87.5\% thinning treatment. Treatments with 0 \% and 50\%
   thinning have favored the obtaining of higher values of cell wall
   thickness and lower values of microfibril angle. Results suggest that
   this silvicultural practice alters the anatomical properties of Pinus

Title = {Effects of Harvest on the Sustainability and Leaf Productivity of
   Populations of Two Palm Species in Maya Homegardens},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Traditional management practices are usually thought to be sustainable.
   The Maya manage Sabal (Arecaceae) palms in homegardens, using their
   leaves for thatching. The sustainability of such production systems
   depends on the long-term persistence of palm populations, whereas
   resource availability also depends on the number of leaves on individual
   palms. We examined how leaf harvest affects Sabal yapa and S. mexicana
   population growth rates (lambda) and leaf production, comparing
   traditional and alternative harvest regimes in terms of sustainability
   and productivity. Demographic, harvest and leaf production data were
   recorded for three years in two homegardens. We used general integral
   projection models linked to leaf-production models to describe
   population dynamics and productivity. Harvest had no effect on S. yapa's
   vital rates or on lambda, but it changed the growth rate of individuals
   of S. mexicana, with a negligible impact on lambda. Homegardens affected
   lambda values, reflecting the species' ecological affinities. S.
   mexicana, introduced from mesic forests, required watering and shade;
   therefore, its population declined rapidly in the homegarden that lacked
   both water and shade. The lambda of the xerophilic S. yapa was slightly
   larger without watering than with watering. Palms usually compensated
   for leaf extraction, causing the number of leaves harvested per
   individual to increase with harvest intensity. Nevertheless, traditional
   management is relatively mild, allowing standing leaves to accumulate
   but reducing the homegarden's yield. Apparently, the Maya do not seek to
   maximize annual production but to ensure the availability of large
   numbers of leaves in homegardens. These leaves may then be used when the
   entire roof of a hut needs to be replaced every few years.},

Title = {Entrapment Bias of Arthropods in Miocene Amber Revealed by Trapping
   Experiments in a Tropical Forest in Chiapas, Mexico},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {All entomological traps have a capturing bias, and amber, viewed as a
   trap, is no exception. Thus the fauna trapped in amber does not
   represent the total existing fauna of the former amber forest, rather
   the fauna living in and around the resin producing tree. In this paper
   we compare arthropods from a forest very similar to the reconstruction
   of the Miocene Mexican amber forest, and determine the bias of different
   trapping methods, including amber. We also show, using cluster analyses,
   measurements of the trapped arthropods, and guild distribution, that the
   amber trap is a complex entomological trap not comparable with a single
   artificial trap. At the order level, the most similar trap to amber is
   the sticky trap. However, in the case of Diptera, at the family level,
   the Malaise trap is also very similar to amber. Amber captured a higher
   diversity of arthropods than each of the artificial traps, based on our
   study of Mexican amber from the Middle Miocene, a time of climate
   optimum, where temperature and humidity were probably higher than in
   modern Central America. We conclude that the size bias is qualitatively
   independent of the kind of trap for non-extreme values. We suggest that
   frequent specimens in amber were not necessarily the most frequent
   arthropods in the former amber forest. Selected taxa with higher numbers
   of specimens appear in amber because of their ecology and behavior,
   usually closely related with a tree-inhabiting life. Finally, changes of
   diversity from the Middle Miocene to Recent time in Central and South
   America can be analyzed by comparing the rich amber faunas from Mexico
   and the Dominican Republic with the fauna trapped using sticky and
   Malaise traps in Central America.},

Abstract = {We present two simple alternative methods to form polymer-derived carbon
   nanodomains in a controlled fashion and at low cost, using custom-made
   chemical vapour deposition and selective laser ablation with a
   commercial CD-DVD platform. Both processes presented shiny and dark
   residual materials after the polymer combustion and according to
   micro-Raman spectroscopy of the domains, graphitic nanocrystals and
   carbon nanotubes have successfully been produced by the combustion of
   polydimethylsiloxane layers. The fabrication processes and
   characterization of the byproduct materials are reported. We demonstrate
   that CVD led to bulk production of graphitic nanocrystals and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes while direct laser ablation may be
   employed for the formation of localized fluorescent nanodots. In the
   latter case, graphitic nanodomains and multi-wall carbon nanotubes are
   left inside microchannels and preliminary results seem to indicate that
   laser ablation could offer a tuning control of the nature and optical
   properties of the nanodomains that are left inside micropatterns with
   on-demand geometries. These low-cost methods look particularly promising
   for the formation of carbon nanoresidues with controlled properties and
   in applications where high integration is desired.},

Abstract = {A space X is said to have the Menger property (or simply X is Menger) if

   If X is a subspace of C-p(Y), where Y-n is Menger for every n is an
   element of omega, and X' (the set of non-isolated points of X) is
   compact, then C-p(X, 2) is Menger; (2) If Cp(X, 2) is Menger and X is

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal
   interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by aberrant
   activation of epithelial cells that induce the migration, proliferation
   and activation of fibroblasts. The resulting distinctive
   fibroblastic/myofibroblastic foci are responsible for the excessive
   extracellular matrix (ECM) production and abnormal lung remodeling. We
   have recently found that matrix metalloproteinase 19 (MMP-19)-deficient
   (Mmp19-/-) mice develop an exaggerated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis,
   but the mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we explored the effect of
   MMP-19 deficiency on fibroblast gene expression and cell behavior.
   Microarray analysis of Mmp19-/- lung fibroblasts revealed the
   dysregulation of several profibrotic pathways, including ECM formation,
   migration, proliferation, and autophagy. Functional studies confirmed
   these findings. Compared with wild-type mice, Mmp19-/- lung fibroblasts
   showed increased alpha 1 (I) collagen gene and collagen protein
   production at baseline and after transforming growth factor-beta
   treatment and increased smooth muscle-alpha actin expression (P < 0.05).
   Likewise, Mmp19-deficient lung fibroblasts showed a significant increase
   in proliferation (P < 0.01) and in transmigration and locomotion over
   Boyden chambers coated with type I collagen or with Matrigel (P < 0.05).
   These findings suggest that, in lung fibroblasts, MMP-19 has strong
   regulatory effects on the synthesis of key ECM components, on fibroblast
   to myofibroblast differentiation, and in migration and proliferation.},

Abstract = {The different manifestations of equivalence and similarity in structure
   throughout evolution suggest a continuous and hierarchical process that
   starts out with the origin of a morphological novelty, unit, or
   homologue. Once a morphological unit has originated, its properties
   change subsequently into variants that differ, in magnitude, from the
   original properties found in the common ancestor. We will look into the
   nature of morphological units and their degrees of modification, which
   will provide the starting point for restructuring the concept of
   homology, keeping the use of homology as the identity of an anatomical
   part, and homogeny, as the specific variation of that anatomical part
   during evolution. We will also show that parallelism has a distinct
   placement within an evolutionary continuum between homology and
   homoplasy, whereas the phenomenon of evolutionary convergence is left
   outside this continuum. We will then provide some epistemological and
   developmental criteria to justify these distinctions, showing that there
   is a direct relation between the nature of these concepts and the
   constraints that developmental mechanisms impose on evolution. Finally,
   we will propose a hierarchical model that places homology, homogeny,
   homoplasy, and parallelism, as distinct phenomena within an evolutionary
   continuum. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 324B: 91-103, 2015. (c) 2015

Abstract = {In this paper, we study a virus dynamics model with logistic mitosis,
   cure rate, and intracellular delay. By means of construction of a
   suitable Lyapunov functionals, obtained by linear combinations of
   Volterratype functions, composite quadratic functions and Volterratype
   functionals, we provide the global stability for this model. If R-0, the
   basic reproductive number, satisfies R(0)1, then the infection-free
   equilibrium state is globally asymptotically stable. Our system is
   persistent if R-0>1. On the other hand, if R-0>1, then infection-free
   equilibrium becomes unstable and a unique infected equilibrium exists.
   The local stability analysis is carried out for the infected
   equilibrium, and it is shown that, if the parameters satisfy a
   condition, the infected equilibrium can be unstable and a Hopf
   bifurcation can occur. We also have that if R-0>1, then the infected
   equilibrium state is globally asymptotically stable if a sufficient
   condition is satisfied. We illustrate our findings with some numerical
   simulations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   temperature was increased (p<0.05); the thermal tolerance interval was
   1.3, indicating that this species has a low tolerance indicative that it
   has evolved in highly stable environments. The acclimation response

Abstract = {There are some analyses about the impact of climatic change in the
   distribution of Mexican land mammals. However, this impact has not been
   analyzed on areas of endemism. For this reason, the aim of this analysis
   was to determine the climate change effects in the patterns of endemism
   of the mammals of Mexico, regarding the climatic differences between 2
   time periods, present time (1961-1990) and future time (2080-2099). For
   this purpose, 405 species distribution models of the Mexican land
   mammals were obtained applying a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt), and
   using their projections under climate scenario A2 according to 3 general
   circulation models. Later, an Endemicity Analysis was performed in order
   to identify areas of endemism and their endemic taxa. Twenty-three areas
   of endemism in the present time were identified, while 14-16 areas of
   endemism were identified for the future time. Finally, a comparison
   between present and future time is presented, using spatial analysis and
   measuring vulnerability of the areas of endemicity with a relative
   vulnerability factor. Loss of patterns of endemism, geographic
   displacement, surfaces reduction and change in species composition of
   the areas of endemism show the negative impact that global warming may
   cause on the endemism patterns. All Rights Reserved (C) 2015 Universidad

Title = {Glacier melting during lava dome growth at Nevado de Toluca volcano
   (Mexico): Evidences of a major threat before main eruptive phases at
   ice-caped volcanoes},

Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Nevado de Toluca volcano is one of the largest stratovolcanoes in the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. During Late Pleistocene its activity was
   characterized by large dome growth and subsequent collapse emplacing
   large block and ash flow deposits, intercalated by Plinian eruptions.
   Morphological and paleoclimate studies at Nevado de Toluca and the
   surrounding area evidenced that the volcano was affected by extensive
   glaciation during Late Pleistocene and Holocene. During the older
   recognized glacial period (27-60 ka, MIS 3), the glacier was disturbed
   by the intense magmatic and hydrothermal activity related to two dome
   extrusion episodes (at 37 ka and 28 ka). Glacier reconstruction
   indicates maximum ice thickness of 90 m along main valleys, as at the
   Cano ravines, the major glacial valley on the northern slope of the
   volcano. Along this ravine, both 37 and 28 ka block-and-ash deposits are
   exposed, and they directly overlay a fluviatile sequence, up to 40
   m-thick, which C-14 ages clearly indicate that their emplacement
   occurred just before the dome collapsed. These evidences point to a
   clear interaction between the growing dome and its hydrothermal system
   with the glacier. During dome growth, a large amount of melting water
   was released along major glacial valleys forming thick fluvioglacial
   sequences that were subsequently covered by the block-and-ash flow
   deposits generated by the collapse of the growing dome. Even though this
   scenario is no longer possible at the Nevado de Toluca volcano, the data
   presented here indicate that special attention should be paid to the
   possible inundation areas from fluviatile/lahar activity prior to the
   main magmatic eruption at ice-capped volcanoes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Fiddler crabs are common decapods of intertidal zones; thirteen species
   have been reported along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, inhabiting
   different zones. For the southern region of the Tamiahua Lagoon,
   Veracruz, Mexico, five species have been identified: Uca panacea, U.
   rapax, U. spinicarpa, U. virens and U. vocator particularly in the
   southern region of the Tamiahua Lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico. Here we
   analysed the fecundity of U. virens in 25 ovigerous females out of 387
   individuals collected between December 2008 and December 2009 during
   eight field trips and from five collection sites. Morphological
   measurements like carapace length (CL) and carapace width (CW), and
   total wet weight (TWW) for all individuals collected were taken, and
   total egg number was counted for ovigerous females. The total population
   was divided in nine size class intervals. Total egg number varied
   between 3,617 and 41,099. Egg number increased with CW (ranging from 9.0
   to 18.6 mm CW) and TWW. Values of fecundity observed for U. virens in
   Tamiahua Lagoon vs other Uca species were similar to results reported in
   literature.},

Abstract = {A transversal study was conducted at the University City campus of the
   National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, with the
   goal of estimating the university community preference for drinking
   either tap water or bottled water and the reasons for their selection. A
   representative sample of three university community subpopulations
   (students, workers/administrative staff, and academic personnel) were
   interviewed with respect to their water consumption habits. The results
   showed that 75\% of the university community drinks only bottled water
   and that the consumption of tap water is low. The interviewees responded
   that the main reason for this preference is the organoleptic features of
   tap water independent of quality. In general, the participants in this
   study do not trust the quality of the tap water, which could be caused
   by the facilities that distribute bottled water encouraging a general
   disinterest in learning about the origin and management of the tap water
   that is distributed on campus.},

Abstract = {Due to differential resource allocation by male and female plants,
   herbivores tend to feed more on male plants than on female ones. It is
   believed that the preferred food gives the organism a better
   performance. Buddleja cordata is an abundant dioicous plant in the
   ``Pedregal de San Angel, Mexico City. This plant is the food of the
   monophagous geometrid Acronyctodes mexicanaria. The objective of this
   study was to determine if the dioecy of B. cordata affects nutritional
   and performance parameters of A. mexicanaria (consumption, metabolic use
   of the food, growth, and density of caterpillars on male and female
   trees). Feeding preference, development time of caterpillars, and 5
   variables concerning consumption and growth efficiencies were analyzed
   for caterpillars collected from male and female trees, and which were
   fed in the laboratory with leaves from trees of each sex. There was no
   significant difference between caterpillar density on female and male
   trees; however, we found that caterpillars preferred feeding on female
   leaves, and they obtained better nutritional efficiencies and grew more
   quickly when feeding on female leaves than on male leaves. All Rights

Abstract = {Latest studies have contributed to the floristic knowledge of Guerrero
   state, however, there are still regions that have not been studied, for
   example, the north of Guerrero, where the municipality of Buenavista de
   Cuellar is located. This municipality belongs to the priority
   terrestrial region 120 ``Sierras de Taxco-Huautla{''}. Therefore, this
   paper presents the floristic inventory, an floristic similarity analysis
   and the vegetation types from the municipality of Buenavista del
   Cuellar. The floristic list includes 611 species, 331 genera, and 94
   families distributed in five vegetation types: Juniper forest, pine-oak
   forest, oak forest, tropical deciduous forest and grassland. The
   tropical deciduous forest is the most diverse, with 47.62\% of the
   vegetal species in Buenavista de Cuellar. Magnoliophyta is the group
   that provides the greatest specific richness with 96.07\%. The best
   represented families are Asteraceae (81 species), Fabaceae (60),
   Apocynaceae (28) and Convolvulaceae (22). Besides, there were found 29
   endemic species for Mexico, 11 for Cuenca del Balsas and 4 for Guerrero.
   The floristic similarity analysis of Buenavista de Cuellar with the
   Sierra de Taxco, Sierra de Huautla and ``General Juan N. Alvarez{''}
   National Park, showed the greatest similarity of the study site with

Title = {Track analysis beyond panbiogeography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {413-425},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {AimPanbiogeography, as originally formulated by Leon Croizat, assumed
   that vicariance and range expansion are the only biogeographical
   processes needed to explain general biotic distributions. This was in
   opposition to the prevailing paradigm at the time, known as
   dispersalism, which postulates that organisms evolve in centres of
   origin' from pre-existing species and then randomly cross barriers to
   occupy new areas, where they adapt and evolve into new species. The
   panbiogeographic approach is implemented through track analysis, which
   consists of three basic steps: constructing individual tracks for two or
   more different taxa, obtaining generalized tracks where two or more
   different individual tracks coincide, and identifying nodes in the areas
   where two or more generalized tracks intersect. In this synthesis I
   discuss some criticisms that have been directed at panbiogeography and
   track analysis.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsI evaluated the papers with track analyses that have been
   published in the last few decades and the critiques provided by several
   authors.
   ResultsMost of the critiques have been directed at the original
   panbiogeographic approach, with its complete or almost complete reliance
   on vicariance explanations. Track analyses published in the 1980s and
   1990s usually applied a strict vicariance explanation; however, most of
   the analyses published in the last 10years or so consider both
   vicariance and dispersal to explain the observed patterns.
   Main conclusionsAlthough Croizat's metaphor Earth and life evolve
   together' may be a useful guide to understanding broad, general
   patterns, the relationships between Earth history and life are more
   complex because biotic history is reticulate. To reduce our explanations
   exclusively to vicariance or dispersal is misguided. We should integrate
   both processes into a dispersal-vicariance model that allows us to
   understand the evolution of biotic distributions, incorporating the
   dating of the lineages and the identification of the cenocrons (sets of
   taxa that share the same biogeographical history) that coexist within
   biotas. In the framework of this model, panbiogeographic track analysis
   is a useful method for identifying biotas, and may constitute the first
   step of an evolutionary biogeographical analysis.},

Abstract = {The atmospheric composition of the San Diego - Tijuana border is
   affected by transport of air pollutants between both regions and in both
   directions. In this study we show NO2 transport events identified during
   Cal-Mex 2010 field experiment at two different ground sites, located one
   downwind of the other. This field campaign was designed to overlap with
   the closing weeks of CalNex project to observe trans-boundary pollution
   transport in this area. The measurements showed a clear dispersion
   pattern of NO2 towards the east-southeast on several occasions during
   the field experiment. Additionally, the NO2 column distribution above
   the Tijuana - San Diego region was reconstructed from the OMI satellite
   data product, and a cluster analysis with the corresponding
   meteorological data was performed to identify four distinct wind
   patterns yielding different NO2 distribution maps and detecting dominant
   wind patterns in this region, either towards the E-SE or E-NE
   approximately 86\% of the time.},

Abstract = {This work deals with a three-dimensional system, which describes a food
   web model consisting of a prey, a specialist predator and a top predator
   which is generalist as it consumes the other two species. Using tools of
   dynamical systems we prove that the trajectories of system are bounded
   and that open subsets of parameters exist, such that the system in the
   first octant has at most two singularities. For an open subset of the
   parameters space, the system is shown to have an invariant compact set
   and this is a topologically transitive attractor set. Finally, we find
   another open set in the parameters space, such that the system has two
   limit cycles each contained in different invariant planes. The work is
   completed with a numeric simulation showing the attractor is a strange
   attractor.},

Title = {Diversification in the Andes: the Atlapetes brush-finches},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {135-152},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With nearly 30 species, the Atlapetes brush-finches are one of the most
   species-rich genera in the New World sparrows (Passerellidae). Atlapetes
   is mainly distributed in highland forests from Mexico to north-western
   Argentina, with a few taxa in the foothills (<1000 m). Species diversity
   is highest in South America, because of high rates of local replacement
   but few cases of local co-occurrence, creating a mosaic of forms with
   different plumage colours. With the purpose of understanding
   phylogenetic and environmental determinants of trait evolution, we
   reconstructed a molecular phylogeny based on full ND2 mtDNA sequences,
   with focus on the core group of Andean Atlapetes species and related
   outgroups. Phylogenetic relationships revealed that most Andean species
   are closely related to a geographical neighbour, although these
   neighbours may often be phenotypically quite different, with
   yellow-plumaged species sister to grey-plumaged taxa. Biogeographic
   analyses suggest Mesoamerica as the area of origin for Atlapetes, which
   dispersed through the Panama Isthmus to the eastern Andean slope, then
   the western Andes and finally the southern Andes. Diversification in the
   genus was apparently influenced by the glacial cycles that affected the
   distribution of montane forests in the Neotropics, particularly during
   the last million years. Phenotypic plumage changes may be associated
   with ecological conditions, with black dorsum in the wettest areas and a
   pale dorsum in a group of closely related species in dry environments on
   the Pacific slope. Local sympatry and ecological segregation presumably
   does not lead to increased divergence in plumage signals or song.},

Abstract = {We discuss a possible origin of the experimentally observed nonlinear

   critical temperature T (c) in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
   with respect to the critical temperature T (c) (0) of an ideal gas. We
   found that accounting for a nonlinear (quadratic) Zeeman effect (with
   applied magnetic field closely matching a Feshbach resonance field B
   (0)) in the mean-field approximation results in a rather significant
   renormalization of the field-free nonlinear contribution b (2), namely,
   T (c) /T (c) (0) a parts per thousand integral b (2){*} (a/lambda (T)
   )(2) (where a is the s-wave scattering length, lambda (T) is the thermal
   wavelength at T (c) (0) ) with b (2){*} = gamma(2) b (2) and gamma =
   gamma(B (0)). In particular, we predict b (2){*} a parts per thousand

   We evaluated the diversity of marine ascomycetes on five tourist beaches

   units were collected randomly from each beach during each sampling time.
   Seven species were recovered, of which Lindra thalassiae and
   Corollospora maritima were the most dominant species. Corollospora
   gracilis and Lulworthia grandispora are new records for Cozumel Island.
   The highest diversity value was found in San Francisco beach, probably
   because the surrounding coral reefs are an important source of a wide
   variety of substrata for these fungi. (C) 2014 The Mycological Society

Abstract = {Rationale: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) represents a lung
   inflammation provoked by exposure to a variety of antigens. Chronic HP
   may evolve to lung fibrosis. Bone marrow derived fibrocytes migrate to
   injured tissues and contribute to fibrogenesis, but their role in HP is
   unknown.
   Objectives: To assess the possible participation of fibrocytes in
   chronic HP.
   Methods: CD45(+)/CXCR4(+)/Col-I+ circulating fibrocytes were evaluated
   by flow cytometry, and the presence of fibrocytes in HP and normal lungs
   by confocal microscopy. The concentration of CXCL12 in plasma and
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluids was quantified by ELISA. The effect of
   fibrocytes on lung fibroblasts and T lymphocytes was examined in
   co-cultures.
   Measurements and Main Results: The percentage of circulating fibrocytes
   was significantly increased in patients with HP compared with healthy
   individuals (5.3 +/- 3.4\% vs. 0.8 +/- 0.7\%; P = 0.00004). Numerous
   fibrocytes were found infiltrating the HP lungs near fibroblasts and
   lymphocytes. Plasma CXCL12 concentration was significantly increased in
   patients with HP (2,303.3 +/- 813.7 vs. 1,385.6 +/- 318.5 pg/ml;
   P=0.00003), and similar results were found in bronchoalveolar lavage
   fluids. The chemokine was primarily expressed by epithelial cells. In
   co-cultures, fibrocytes induced on lung fibroblasts a significant
   increase in the expression of alpha(1) type I collagen, matrix
   metalloprotease-1, and platelet-derived growth factor-beta. Likewise,
   fibrocytes induced the up-regulation of CCL2 in HP lymphocytes and
   fibroblasts.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that high levels of fibrocytes
   are present in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic HP and that
   these cells infiltrate the HP lungs. Fibrocytes may participate in the
   pathogenesis of HP, amplifying the inflammatory and fibrotic response by
   paracrine signaling inducing the secretion of a variety of
   proinflammatory and profibrotic molecules.},

Title = {Free-living ciliates from epiphytic tank bromeliads in Mexico},

Abstract = {The ciliate diversity of Mexican bromeliads is poorly known. We studied
   the ciliate community of two species of epiphytic tank bromeliads from
   48 individuals of Tillandsia heterophylla and four of T. prodigiosa. The
   bromeliads occurred on over 22 tree host species. Samples were collected
   during 2009 and 2010 in a mountain cloud forest and in two coffee
   plantations and in a pine oak forest. The ciliates were identified in
   live and protargol preparations. We recorded 61 ciliate species
   distributed in 39 genera grouped in eight classes. Ten species were
   frequent in the 52 samples (20 +/- 3.2) and Leptopharynx bromeliophilus
   was the most frequent recorded in 25 samples. Thirty-three species are
   new for the fauna of Mexico, 24 species have been recorded for the first
   time in tank bromeliads. The classes Spirotrichea, Oligohymenophorea and
   Colpodea presented the highest number of species, 16, 14, and 12,
   respectively. Colpoda was the most species-rich genus being present with
   six species. A low similarity between areas and seasons was obtained
   with Jaccard's index. We conclude that the two bromeliads species host a
   rich ciliate diversity whose knowledge contributes to the question of
   ciliate distribution and specifically, in tank bromeliads. (C) 2014

Title = {``We are the city lungs{''}: Payments for ecosystem services in the
   outskirts of Mexico City},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {138-148},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have emerged as an incentive-based
   policy instrument to manage and secure the flow of ecosystem services
   for human wellbeing. PES implementation has been mostly examined in
   rural areas but very few studies have paid attention to experiences in
   rural-urban landscapes that provide critical ecosystem services for
   densely populated areas. Informed by household surveys and focus groups,
   we analyze the implementation of Mexico's federal program of Payments
   for Watershed Services (PSAH in Spanish) in two communities located in
   the rural-urban fringe of Mexico City, paying attention to landowners'
   dependence on ecosystem services and both perceived benefits and costs
   of participating in the PSAH program. We demonstrate that landowners are
   generally aware of the critical services they provide to the city and
   beyond but there is a skewed level of knowledge regarding the program
   objectives and an uneven sharing of its benefits. The latter is
   influenced by collective organization and environmental history, with
   higher knowledge and more equitable benefit sharing present in the
   community with a more long-standing commitment to forest conservation.
   The PSAH incentive contributes to household income but it is clearly
   insufficient to motivate strong family and collective action towards
   halting land-use change beyond the PSAH targeted area. We thus argue
   that conservation policy in urban-rural fringes needs to be accompanied
   by effective land-use planning at regional level. This should involve
   multiple stakeholders and the re-conceptualization of Mexico City
   surrounding agricultural lands and forests as spaces to be governed for
   the provision of ecosystem services rather than as areas over which the
   city can expand. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We present the complete phase diagram implied by the generalized
   Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) formalism that in essence is a ternary
   boson-fermion (BF) model with three constituents: two bosonic
   {[}two-electron Cooper pairs (2e-CPs) and two-hole Cooper pairs
   (2h-CPs)] along with unpaired electrons whose number naturally vanishes
   in the limit of infinite e-e coupling. There arise three coupled
   transcendental equations to be solved self-consistently: two gap-like
   equations (one for each kind of CPs) and a third which guarantees charge
   conservation via the number equation for the total electron number
   density of the system. The unknown variables are the chemical potential
   as well as the number density of zero-momentum 2e-CPs and 2h-CPs, each
   depending on coupling as well as absolute temperature. The GBEC subsumes
   as special cases all statistical theories of superconductors including
   BCS and BEC. It also subsumes the BCS-Bose ``crossover{''} theory which
   in turn relates BCS with BEC. The GBEC formalism yields a substantial
   increase in critical temperature compared with BCS theory even with only
   electron-phonon dynamics.},

Abstract = {The shallow water sea anemone Phymanthus crucifer exhibits three
   distinct morphotypes, characterized by the presence or absence of
   protuberances on the marginal tentacles, as well as intermediate forms.
   The taxonomic status of the different morphotypes and the diagnostic
   value of protuberances on the tentacles have been debated for this
   species and the family Phymanthidae. We analysed the external and
   internal anatomy, cnidae and three mitochondrial molecular markers for
   representatives of each of the three morphotypes. In addition, we
   address the putative monophyly of the family Phymanthidae based on
   molecular data. With the exception of the protuberances, our
   morphological and molecular results show no differences among the three
   morphotypes; thus, we consider this feature to be intraspecific
   variability within P. crucifer. Furthermore, molecular data reveal that
   the family Phymanthidae is not monophyletic. In addition, we discuss
   several diagnostic morphological features of the family Phymanthidae.},

Title = {Leucaena macrophylla: An ecosystem services provider?},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Leucaena macrophylla, a tree native to southern Mexico's tropical dry
   forest, belongs to a genus that is popular worldwide as a component of
   agroforestry systems. However, despite appreciation by local
   communities, this species is poorly studied and has not been evaluated
   as a multipurpose tree in its native range. This work evaluated whether
   L. macrophylla has the qualities necessary to serve as a multipurpose
   tree for agroforestry systems and a provider of ecosystem services in
   its original distribution, specifically, in soil nutrient amelioration
   and recovery, fuelwood production, and provision of quality livestock
   fodder. Leaves contained high values of nitrogen and calcium, and litter
   decomposition was relatively rapid (similar to 50 \% of mass lost over
   first 6 months). Despite somewhat low wood density, this species' high
   calorific value and low ash and moisture contents yielded a relatively
   high firewood value index (FVI = 2,594.65), suggesting high potential as
   a fuelwood. In terms of fodder quality, protein and digestible fiber
   contents were high and in vitro digestibility was adequate, as was
   condensed tannin concentration. It is important to mention, however,
   that L. macrophylla showed higher-than-ideal contents of lignin, both in
   fresh leaves and in litter. However, this apparently does not
   drastically reduce overall quality (i.e. decomposition rate and in vitro
   digestibility), and appropriate management techniques such as composting
   can mitigate its effects. Given its potential for providing a variety of
   ecosystem services, we recommend that L. macrophylla be installed in
   agroforestry systems in its native range to evaluate its effect on crop
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Velocity logs are the most important data used to evaluate rock, fluid,
   and geotechnical properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs. As a
   complementary physical property, P-wave attenuation (Q-1) can be used as
   an indicator of lithology and fluid saturation in oil and gas reservoir
   characterization. We implemented an inversion self-consistent rock
   physical model to predict P-and S-wave velocities in two old wells near
   a new well containing a complete suite of logs at the Waggoner Ranch oil
   reservoir in northeast Texas. We selected a training data set from the
   new well to test the algorithm that was subsequently applied to predict
   velocity data in the two old wells. We used an attenuation log from the
   new well to perform data analysis via the Gamma test, a mathematically
   nonparametric nonlinear smooth modeling tool, to choose the best input
   combination of well logs to train an artificial neural network (NN) for
   estimating Q-1. Then, the NN was applied to predict attenuation logs in
   the old wells. The Q-1 logs detected oil-saturated sand that was modeled
   with a rock physical model. This is a significant result that revealed
   for the first time that oil, gas, and water saturations of sand can be
   quantified from an attenuation anomaly estimated from full-waveform
   sonic data. In addition, water, oil, and gas saturations of the sand
   were determined from Q-1 anomalies observed in the old wells. This
   confirms the productivity of the Upper Milham oil-saturated sand
   intercepted by the three wells. The velocity, density, and Q-1 logs were
   used to generate synthetic seismograms to calibrate seismic data to
   verify and evaluate the work flow for predicting velocity and
   attenuation logs in older wells. This demonstrated that attenuation logs
   can discriminate between anomalies due to lithology and those due to oil
   and gas saturation.},

Abstract = {Marine sponges usually constitute the most diverse group of the benthic
   community in coral reefs. Although they are reasonably well studied at
   the northern Gulf of Mexico (GMx), the southern GMx is poorly known and
   lacks records from many major reef systems that lie off the Mexican
   coast. The present taxonomic study is the first sponge account from
   Alacranes reef, the largest coral reef system in the GMx, and from the
   shallow reef banks of Sisal, both in the northwest Yucatan Peninsula.
   The 19 species herein described represent the first sponge fauna records
   from these reefs. Among these, seven species represent new record for
   GMx: Erylus formosus, Cliona flavifodina, Spirastrella aff. mollis,
   Strongylacidon bermuda, Topsentia bahamensis, Agelas tubulata and
   Chelonaplysilla aff. erecta. Twelve species are new records for the
   Southern GMx: Erylus trisphaerus, Cliona amplicavata, Chondrilla
   caribensis, Halichondria lutea, Hymeniacidon caerulea, Axinella
   corrugata, Dragmacidon reticulatum, Chalinula molitba, Amphimedon
   caribica, A. complanata, Hyatella cavernosa and Dysidea variabilis.
   Additionally, a redescription of Erylus trisphaerus is presented which
   had not been reviewed since its original description in 1953 off Western
   Florida, except that it was listed for north La Habana, Cuba.},

Title = {Ethnopharmacological field study of the plants used to treat type 2
   diabetes among the Cakchiquels in Guatemala},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {159},

Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Type 2 diabetes is characterized by
   tissue resistance to the action of insulin, combined with a relative
   deficiency in insulin secretion. In Guatemala, type 2 diabetes results
   in significant mortality rates. The low incomes of the indigenous
   population results in the use of alternative therapies such as medicinal
   plants to treat the illness. We could not find any previous study
   related to the use of medicinal plants to treat diabetes in Guatemala.
   The aim of this work is to determine the most effective plant species
   used in traditional medicine to treat type 2 diabetes.
   Materials and methods: We performed an ethnopharmacological field study
   among the Cakchiquels of Chimaltenango to select the most prominent
   plants used to treat the disease. Type 2 diabetic patients from their
   community health centers were interviewed using structured
   questionnaires. Two mathematical tools were used to identify potential
   plant species: the Disease Consensus Index and the Use Value.
   International databases, including SCOPUS. PubMed, and Google Scholar,
   were used to identify whether the plants with the highest scores were
   known to elicit hypoglycemic effects.
   Results: After analyzing the data, we can propose the following plants
   as the most prominent among the Cakchiquels of Chimaltenango to treat
   type 2 diabetes: Hamelia patens Jacq., Neurolaena lobata (L.) R.Br.ex
   Cass., Solanum americanum Mill., Croton guatemalensis Lotsy, and Quercus
   peduncularis Nee.
   Conclusions: The Cakchiquel patients interviewed did not understand type
   2 diabetes: however, they associated the onset of their disease with a
   negative emotion, such as shock, sadness or anger. Despite changes in
   lifestyle, influences of advertising, the availability of innovative
   treatments and the use of oral hypoglycemic treatments provided by
   health facilities serving indigenous communities, the Cakchiquel
   continue to use medicinal plants as adjunctive treatment. While they are
   unaware whether the plants can cause additional harm, they consider
   their consumption beneficial because they feel better. There were 11
   plants identified with UVs greater than 0.5 and high DCIs: from these
   64\% of the plants have been identified as having hypoglycemic effects:
   this finding supports the traditional selection by the Cakchiquels of
   medicinal plants to treat T2D. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {Silo Collapse under Granular Discharge},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {114},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {We investigate, at a laboratory scale, the collapse of cylindrical
   shells of radius R and thickness t induced by a granular discharge. We
   measure the critical filling height for which the structure fails upon
   discharge. We observe that the silos sustain filling heights
   significantly above an estimation obtained by coupling standard
   shell-buckling and granular stress distribution theories. Two effects
   contribute to stabilize the structure: (i) below the critical filling
   height, a dynamical stabilization due to granular wall friction prevents
   the localized shell-buckling modes to grow irreversibly; (ii) above the
   critical filling height, collapse occurs before the downward sliding
   motion of the whole granular column sets in, such that only a partial
   friction mobilization is at play. However, we notice also that the
   critical filling height is reduced as the grain size d increases. The
   importance of grain size contribution is controlled by the ratio d/root
   Rt. We rationalize these antagonist effects with a novel fluid-structure
   theory both accounting for the actual status of granular friction at the
   wall and the inherent shell imperfections mediated by the grains. This
   theory yields new scaling predictions which are compared with the
   experimental results.},

Abstract = {A new species of pterygosomatid mite, Geckobiella variabilis sp. nov.
   (Acariformes: Pterygosomatidae) is described based on adults (female and
   male) and a larva. This new mite species was collected from two species
   of lizards of the genus Sceloporus (Phrynosomatidae) from the coast of
   the Gulf of Mexico. Geckobiella variabilis sp. nov. is very close to
   Geckobiella harrisi and Geckobiella texana; this new species can be
   readily distinguished from G. harrisi by the presence of solenidion
   omega 2 on tarsi I and solenidion omega on tarsi III and from G. texana
   by the spatulate setae on dorsum and lateral parts of idiosoma, the
   barbed genital setae (g1) and coxae III-IV located very close to the
   anogenital area. The phylogenetic position of G. variabilis sp. nov.
   within Geckobiella is discussed, and an identification key for all the
   species of the genus is provided.

Title = {Helminths of three species of opossums (Mammalia, Didelphidae) from
   Mexico},
Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {511},
Pages = {131-152},
Abstract = {From August 2011 to November 2013, 68 opossums (8 Didelphis sp., 40
   Didelphis virginiana, 15 Didelphis marsupialis, and 5 Philander opossum)
   were collected in 18 localities from 12 Mexican states. A total of
   12,188 helminths representing 21 taxa were identified (6 trematodes, 2
   cestodes, 3 acanthocephalans and 10 nematodes). Sixty-six new locality
   records, 9 new host records, and one species, the trematode Brachylaima
   didelphus, is added to the composition of the helminth fauna of the
   opossums in Mexico. These data, in conjunction with previous records,
   bring the number of taxa parasitizing the Mexican terrestrial marsupials
   to 41. Among these species, we recognized a group of helminths typical
   of didelphids in other parts of the Americas. This group is constituted
   by the trematode Rhopalias coronatus, the acanthocephalan
   Oligacanthorhynchus microcephalus and the nematodes Cruzia tentaculata,
   Gnathostoma turgidum, and Turgida turgida. In general, the helminth
   fauna of each didelphid species showed a stable taxonomic composition
   with respect to previously sampled sites. This situation suggests that
   the rate of accumulation of helminth species in the inventory of these 3
   species of terrestrial marsupials in the Neotropical portion of Mexico
   is decreasing; however, new samplings in the Nearctic portion of this
   country will probably increase the richness of the helminthological
   inventory of this group of mammals.},

Title = {Mismatch between body growth and shell preference in hermit crabs is

Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {743},
Number = {1},
Pages = {151-156},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hermit crabs recognize different shell attributes and choose shell size,
   type, or species to maximize their individual fitness. Aquatic hermit
   crab species commonly prefer relatively heavy shells species in contrast
   to semi-terrestrial crabs which prefer lighter shells. Lighter shells
   favor rapid growth and increase individual fitness because larger
   individual achieve higher success in intra-and inter-individual
   competition. In this study, we experimentally measured the daily growth
   of hermit crabs Calcinus californiensis that were forced to occupy four
   different shell species with different internal volume to mass ratios
   (IV/M ratio), and whose sequence in preference is known from previous
   studies (Cantharus > Stramonita > Columbella > Nerita). The shell with
   the highest IV/M ratio (Nerita) favored body growth rate, while the
   relatively heaviest (lowest IV/M ratios) and most preferred shells
   (Stramonita and Cantharus) hindered body growth. Our results suggest
   that in this aquatic hermit crab, the benefits of carrying heavy shells
   that give better predatory protection exceeded the benefits of rapid
   growth that can be obtained using lighter, thinner, and less protective
   shells.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the influence of geochemical and environmental
   factors on seasonal variation in metals in Yucatan's Chelem lagoon.
   Anthropogenic activities discharge non-treated wastewater directly into
   it with detrimental environmental consequences. Accordingly, this study
   established the spatial and temporal patterns of fine grain sediments
   and concentrations of heavy metals. Multivariate analyses showed fine
   grain facies deposition, transition sites dominated by fine grain
   transport, and fine grain erosion sites. Spatial and temporal variations
   of heavy metals concentration were significant for Cd, Cu, Cr, and Pb.
   As, Cd, and Sn were as much as 12 times higher than SQuiRTs standards
   (Buchman 2008). The results indicate that aquifer water is bringing
   metals from relatively far inland and releasing them into the lagoon.
   Thus, it appears that the contamination of this lagoon is highly complex
   and must take into account systemic connections with inland
   anthropogenic activates and pollution, as well as local factors.},

Title = {Diverse Short-Term Dynamics of Inhibitory Synapses Converging on
   Striatal Projection Neurons: Differential Changes in a Rodent Model of
   Parkinson's Disease},
Journal = {NEURAL PLASTICITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Most neurons in the striatum are projection neurons (SPNs) which make
   synapses with each other within distances of approximately 100 mu m.
   About 5\% of striatal neurons are GABAergic interneurons whose axons
   expand hundreds of microns. Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP)
   between fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and SPNs and between SPNs has
   been described with electrophysiological and optogenetic techniques. It
   is difficult to obtain pair recordings from some classes of interneurons
   and due to limitations of actual techniques, no other types of STSP have
   been described on SPNs. Diverse STSPs may reflect differences in
   presynaptic release machineries. Therefore, we focused the present work
   on answering two questions: Are there different identifiable classes of
   STSP between GABAergic synapses on SPNs? And, if so, are synapses
   exhibiting different classes of STSP differentially affected by dopamine
   depletion? Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings on SPNs revealed three
   classes of STSPs: depressing, facilitating, and biphasic
   (facilitating-depressing), in response to stimulation trains at 20 Hz,
   in a constant ionic environment. We then used the 6-hydroxydopamine
   (6-OHDA) rodent model of Parkinson's disease to show that synapses with
   different STSPs are differentially affected by dopamine depletion. We
   propose a general model of STSP that fits all the dynamics found in our
   recordings.},

Abstract = {The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) produces a complex mixture of
   gases and aerosols from diverse sources, including burning of fossil
   fuels, biomass, and wastes, with a significant biogenic contribution. We
   present the first results of ongoing projects to study temporal and
   spatial variations of (CO2)-C-14 in the area. Temporal variations
   reconstructed from tree rings of Taxodium mucronatum indicate a
   considerable radiocarbon depletion, in accordance to the vast amount of
   fossil fuels burnt inside Mexico Valley, with values between 62 and 246
   parts per thousand lower than background values for the 1962-1968
   period, and lower by 51-88 parts per thousand for the 1983-2010 period.
   The lower dilution found for the last decades might indicate an increase
   in enriched (CO2)-C-14 sources. Results from the spatial distribution,
   as revealed from integrated CO2 samples and grasses from six points
   within the MCMA collected during the 2013 dry season, show variations
   between sites and sample types. For integrated CO2 samples, values range
   from 35.6 parts per thousand to 54.0 parts per thousand, and for grasses
   between -86.8 parts per thousand and 40.7 parts per thousand. For three
   of the sampling points, the grasses are significantly depleted, by up to
   similar to 133 parts per thousand, as compared to the corresponding
   integrated CO2 sample. This may result from differences in the carbon
   assimilation period and exposure to different CO2 sources.
   Higher-than-background Delta C-14 values were found for all integrated
   CO2 samples, presumably resulting from C-14-enriched CO2 derived from
   forest fires in the mountains during the sampling period. Results
   obtained so far confirm the complexity of the C-14 cycle in the MCMA.},

   the Host Lineages},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that RNA viruses and other subcellular entities
   endowed with RNA genomes are relicts from an ancient RNA/protein World
   which is believed to have preceded extant DNA/RNA/protein-based cells.
   According to their proponents, this possibility is supported by the
   small-genome sizes of RNA viruses and their manifold replication
   strategies, which have been interpreted as the result of an evolutionary
   exploration of different alternative genome organizations and
   replication strategies during early evolutionary stages. At the other
   extreme are the giant DNA viruses, whose genome sizes can be as large as
   those of some prokaryotes, and which have been grouped by some authors
   into a fourth domain of life. As argued here, the comparative analysis
   of the chemical nature and sizes of the viral genomes reported in
   GenBank does not reveal any obvious correlation with the phylogenetic
   history of their hosts. Accordingly, it is somewhat difficult to
   reconcile the proposal of the putative pre-DNA antiquity of RNA viruses,
   with their extraordinary diversity in plant hosts and their apparent
   absence among the Archaea. Other issues related to the genome size of
   all known viruses and subviral agents and the relationship with their
   hosts are discussed.},

Abstract = {A stratigraphic section measured in the northern area of Monserrat
   Island, Baja California Sur, yielded abundant moderate to well-preserved
   benthic foraminifers, rare planktonic foraminifers, calcareous
   nannoplankton, and ostracods. Based on both planktonic microfossils,
   relative age situates the base of the section from the Uppermost Miocene
   to Lower Pliocene, while the top is Upper Zanclean (around 5.06-3.3 Ma).
   The abundant benthic foraminifer assemblage is characterized by small
   tests and a few dominant species, i.e. Bolivinella seminuda, Brizalina
   subadvena and Brizalina interjuncta. The foraminifers are characterized
   as low-oxygen-related biofacies; the absence of heavily calcified fauna
   suggests that oxygen concentration of the bottom water was <0.3 ml/L.
   The presence of abundant pristine foraminiferal tests typical of an
   upper bathyal biofacies such as Planulina ornata, along with features
   considered as adaptations to low-oxygen conditions, suggest that the
   upper limit of the oxygen minimum zone was shallow, at a water depth of
   probably around 150m.},

Title = {Reviving Lonidamine and 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine to Be Used in
   Combination for Metabolic Cancer Therapy},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Abnormal metabolism is another cancer hallmark. The two most
   characterized altered metabolic pathways are high rates of glycolysis
   and glutaminolysis, which are natural targets for cancer therapy.
   Currently, a number of newer compounds to block glycolysis and
   glutaminolysis are being developed; nevertheless, lonidamine and
   6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) are two old drugs well characterized as
   inhibitors of glycolysis and glutaminolysis, respectively, whose
   clinical development was abandoned years ago when the importance of
   cancer metabolism was not fully appreciated and clinical trial
   methodology was less developed. In this review, a PubMed search using
   the words lonidamine and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) was undertaken
   to analyse existing information on the preclinical and clinical studies
   of these drugs for cancer treatment. Data show that they exhibit
   antitumor effects; besides there is also the suggestion that they are
   synergistic. We conclude that lonidamine and DON are safe and
   potentially effective drugs that need to be reevaluated in combination
   as metabolic therapy of cancer.},

Abstract = {In the past decades, the procedure to identify novel antibiotic
   compounds has been motivated by the heuristic discovery of the
   antibiotic penicillin by Fleming in 1929. Since then, researches have
   been isolating compounds from very wide range of living forms with the
   hope of repeating Fleming's story. Yet, the rate of discovery of new
   pharmaceutical compounds has reached a plateau in the last decade and
   this has promoted the use of alternative approaches to identify
   antibiotic compounds. One of these approaches uses the accumulated
   information on pharmaceutical compounds to predict new ones using
   high-performance computers. Such approach brings up the possibility to
   screen for millions of compounds in computer simulations. The better
   predictors though use sophisticated algorithms that take up significant
   amount of computer time, reducing the number of compounds to analyze and
   the likelihood to identify potential antibiotic compounds. At the same
   time, the appearance of computer processors that may be tailored to
   perform specific tasks by the end of the past century provided a tool to
   accelerate high-performance computations. The current review focuses on
   the use of these dedicated processor devices, particularly Field
   Programmable Gate Arrays and Graphic Processing Units, to identify new
   antibacterial peptides. For that end, we review some of the common
   computational methods used to identify antibacterial peptides and
   highlight the difficulties and advantages these algorithms present to be
   coded into FPGA/GPU computational devices. We discuss the potential of
   reaching supercomputing performance on FPGA/GPU, and the approaches for
   parallelism on these platforms.},

Abstract = {We are interested in deformations of Baker domains by a pinching process

   (z), depending on the curves selected, to any map of the form F (p/q)
   (z) = z + e(-z) + 2 pi ip/q, p/q a rational number. This process deforms
   a function with a doubly parabolic Baker domain into a function with an
   infinite number of doubly parabolic periodic Baker domains if p = 0,
   otherwise to a function with wandering domains. Finally, we show that
   certain attracting domains can be deformed by a pinching process into
   doubly parabolic Baker domains.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce and analyze models of
   neurons from a control perspective and to show how recently developed
   analytical tools help to address important biological questions. A first
   objective is to review the basic modeling principles of neurophysiology
   in which neurons are modeled as equivalent nonlinear electrical circuits
   that capture their excitable properties. The specific architecture of
   the models is key to the tractability of their analysis: in spite of
   their high-dimensional and nonlinear nature, the model properties can be
   understood in terms of few canonical positive and negative feedback
   motifs localized in distinct timescales. We use this insight to shed
   light on a key problem in experimental neurophysiology, the challenge of
   understanding the sensitivity of neuronal behaviors to underlying
   parameters in empirically-derived models. Finally, we show how
   sensitivity analysis of neuronal excitability relates to robustness and
   regulation of neuronal behaviors.},

Abstract = {Atresia is the process through which non selectable oocytes are
   eliminated: it involves apoptosis and/or autophagy. This study used
   immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques to characterize the
   lamellae present in the cytoplasm of oocytes in follicles in the process
   of atresia in prepubertal and adult Wistar rats. The results indicate
   that the lamellae are positive to tubulin and myosin immunodetection
   under light and electron microscopy. Labeling is greater with
   anti-tubulin and lesser with anti myosin Our observations indicate that
   lamellae are present in oocytes at the initial antral stage in
   prepubertal rats: that is. from day 14 post-birth to adult age. We were
   able to determine that the increase in altered lamellae principally
   occurs in the apoptotic cells rather than in the autophagic cells.},

Abstract = {Steroidal saponins are natural glycosidic compounds of amphiphilic
   character. Their diverse biological activities are directly related to
   the variability of their structural constitutive frameworks, aglycones,
   and sugars. Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential
   of steroidal saponins by their capacity to induce programmed cell death
   in different tumor cell lines. The process of cell death is required to
   maintain cellular and tissular homeostasis; it has been established that
   disturbances in the balance between cellular proliferation and cell
   death lead to several pathologies, including cancer. The antitumor
   activity of steroidal saponins has been intensely studied allowing
   elucidation of their different molecular mechanisms of action; this
   knowledge is crucial to the establishment of new therapeutic strategies
   against cancer.},

Abstract = {Species of the genus Hypericum have elicited great interest in
   pharmacological research, therefore, their propagation is necessary.
   However, only a low germination percentage has been achieved to date. A
   population of Hypericurn philonotis (Cham. \& Schlecht.) grows every 2
   or 5 years in the Parque Ecologico de la Ciudad de Mexico (PECM). To
   understand seed germination and the population dynamics of H. philonotis
   in the PECM, we studied their seed germination to identify the dormancy
   type. We assessed the effect on germination of light, constant
   temperatures (5-35 degrees C) and fluctuating (25/35 degrees C, 18/6 h,
   with the highest temperature at noon, photoperiod 12/12), cold
   stratification, scarification (with HCl); gibberellins and seed
   immersion in acetone or hexane. We also studied the morphology and
   structure of the seeds, and the allelopathic potential of the pigments
   present in the seed coat on its own seed germination and early seedling
   growth. Light, gibberellins, a combination of temperature with
   gibberellins, and immersion in acetone increased seed germination.
   Alternating temperatures replaced the effect of gibberellins. Immersion
   in acetone eliminated a pigment from the seed coat, enhancing full seed
   germination. The acetone extract from H. philonotis seeds partially
   inhibited seed germination and early growth. The endosperm was reduced,
   and the main reserve in cotyledons was proteins. The H. philonotis seeds
   exhibited physiological dormancy. Gibberellins increased the embryo
   growth potential, reducing the constraint of the thick seed cover and
   any inhibiting effect of the acetone extract. The requirement of light
   and temperature fluctuation acts as an environmental cue for the
   successful germination of these minuscule seeds (0.5-0.8 mm in length).

Abstract = {To measure secondary productivity of mangrove systems, we estimated the
   abundance (individuals/m(2)) and mass increment (g/month) of the two
   bivalve species: the black ark Anadara tuberculosa and palmate oyster
   Saccostrea palmula. Mass increments were based on individual growth
   rates derived from length-frequency distributions analyses. Samples were
   collected at three mangrove estuaries in a sand barrier at Ensenada de
   La Paz from August 2007 to July 2009. The average abundance was 1.27
   individuals/m(2) for black ark and 510 individuals/m(2) for palmate
   oysters. Estimated growth rates were 3.67 g/month for black ark and 0.18
   g/month for palmate oysters. The average secondary productivity of the
   black ark was 4.51 g.m(-2).month(-1) and peaked during the spring, while
   for the palmate oyster Saccostrea palmula it was 97.9 g.m(-2).month(-1),
   with peak productivity recorded during the summer. The findings of this
   investigation constitute a necessary element for establishing a baseline
   to evaluate the consequences of the various natural and anthropogenic
   pressures that the mangrove systems of El Mogote of La Paz Bay, Baja

Abstract = {In this paper we study the complexity of the nuclear states in terms of
   a two body quadupole-quadrupole interaction. Energy distributions and
   eigenvectors composition exhibit a visible interference pattern which is
   dependent on the intensity of the interaction. In analogy with optics,
   the visibility of the interference is related to the purity of the
   states, therefore, we show that the fluctuations associated with quantum
   chaos have as their origin the remaining quantum coherence with a
   visibility magnitude close to 5\%.},

Abstract = {The statistics of spectral fluctuations is sensitive to the unfolding
   procedure that separates global from local properties. Previously, we
   presented a parameter-free and data-adaptive unfolding method that we
   demonstrated to be highly effective for standard random-matrix ensembles
   from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). More general ensembles often break the
   ergodicity property, which leads to ambiguities between
   individual-spectrum averaged and ensemble-averaged fluctuation measures.
   Here, we apply our data-adaptive unfolding to a nonergodic Two-Body
   Random Ensemble (TBRE). In the present approach, both fluctuation
   measures can be calculated simultaneously within the same unfolding
   step, and possible arbitrarities introduced by traditional unfolding
   procedures are avoided.},

Abstract = {The nearby active galaxy NGC 1275, has been widely detected from radio
   to gamma rays. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) shows a
   double-peak feature, which is well explained by synchrotron self-Compton
   (SSC) model. However, recent TeV detections might suggest that
   very-high-energy gamma-rays (E >> 100 GeV) may not have a leptonic
   origin. We test a lepto-hadronic model to describe the whole SED through
   SSC emission and neutral pion decay resulting from p gamma interactions.
   Also, we estimate the neutrino events expected in a km(3) Cherenkov
   telescope.},

   during development mainly in the magnum's mucosa. Immunohistochemical
   analysis showed that the oviduct magnum from 8-day-old chicken embryos
   to one-day-old chickens did not present any PR isoform, but the oviduct
   magnum of one-week and one-month-old chickens expressed PR in the nuclei
   of all cell types. In epithelial cells, PR-B was the only isoform
   expressed; in muscle and serosa cells, PR-A isoform was the only isoform
   expressed; and stromal cells expressed both isoforms. The results also
   demonstrate positive ER-a immunostaining in the nuclei of different
   cells from embryonic life to later developmental stages of the oviduct
   magnum. Data indicate that the variations of ER-a or PR expression or
   dominance of either PR expression is differentially regulated depending
   on the cell type, the development of the oviduct, and in an age-specific
   manner. These variations in sex steroids hormone receptors are related
   with histological changes of the oviduct magnum through development. (C)

Abstract = {The Mexican vaejovid scorpion genus Konentontli Gonzalez-Santillan and
   Prendini, 2013, was created to accommodate five species united, among
   other characters, by a subaculear tubercle on the telson. Species of
   Konetontli are among the smallest vaejovid scorpions. Their very small
   size, cryptic coloration, and apparently seasonal surface activity may
   explain their rarity in collections and it is likely that more
   undescribed species await discovery. In the present contribution, we
   describe four new species (Konetontli ignes, sp. nov.; Konetontli
   ilitchi, sp. nov.; Konetontli juxtlahuaca, sp. nov.; Konetontli migrus,
   sp. nov.) and revalidate Konetontli zihuatanejensis (Baldazo-Monsivaiz,
   2003), comb. nov., previously synonymized with Konetontli acapulco
   (Armas and Martin-Frias, 2001), raising to 10 the number of species in
   the genus; redescribe previously described species, including the first
   description of the female of Konetontli nayarit (Armas and Martin-Frias,
   2001); and present new records, comprehensive distribution maps, and a
   key to the identification of the species.},

   All adult males were collected by pitfall traps, whereas all adult
   females and both sex immatures were collected using Berlese funnels,
   suggesting that males are comparatively more mobile within the leaf
   litter layer, probably due to mating season.},

   and compare its reproductive cycle with that of other populations,
   species, and closely related genera, Adult male A, costata costata
   lizards were collected, and the reproductive tracts were removed and
   subjected to histological analyses. Testicular activity commences in
   March with maximum testicular activity and highest sperm abundance (in
   the epididyrnides) occurring between May and July. The testis remains at
   peak activity until September,,vh en a late regression/ear1,7 quiescent
   phase is observed. Le,,,dig cells follow this same pattern except these
   hormone producing cells remain at maximum secretory level through
   September. Sperm are present in the epididymides in April September.
   This pattern is consistent with the spring recrudescence found in a
   multitude of male lizard taxa. However, this differs from the continuous
   cycle observed in some tropical Tend species and other lizard taxa at
   high elevation. This study indicates that our knowledge about lizard
   spen-natogenic cycles remains incomplete, and additional studies are
   required to fully understand the interactions between phenotype,
   evolution, phylogenetics and environment.},

Title = {DNA Barcoding of the parasitoid wasp subfamily Doryctinae (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae) from Chamela, Mexico},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Background and aims. The Doryctinae is a considerably diverse, poorly
   studied group of parasitoid wasps and one of the most diverse
   subfamilies within Braconidae. Taxonomic knowledge of this group remains
   highly incomplete, specially in the tropics. In Mexico, it has been
   reported as the subfamily with the highest number of recorded genera. A
   preliminary Barcoding study carried out in the Chamela region, located
   near the Mexican pacific coast in Jalisco, identified 185 barcoding
   species of Dorytinae assigned to 19 identified doryctine genera. This
   work updates the later study, representing a three years effort to
   assess the species richness of this subfamily for the Chamela region.
   Materials and methods. Ten collecting field trips of 5 to 10 days each
   were carried out from June 2009 to May 2011. A 2\% divergence criterion
   using the BIN system implemented in BOLD was followed in order to
   establish species boundaries among the specimens that were collected.
   Results and conclusions. A total of 961 specimens were collected, from
   which 883 COI sequences were obtained. The sequences generated
   corresponded to 289 barcoding species and 30 identified genera. The most
   speciose genera were Heterospilus Haliday (170 spp.), Ecphylus Forster
   (19 spp.), Allorhogas Gahan (15 spp.) and Callihormius Ashmead (14
   spp.). Addition of previously collected material increased the diversity
   of the subfamily in the region to 34 genera and 290 species. Paraphyly
   of Heterospilus with respect to Neoheterospilus and Heterospathius was
   again recovered. Twenty new species and two new genera (Sabinita
   Belokobylskij, Zaldivar-Riveron et Martinez, Ficobolus Martinez,
   Belokobylskij et Zaldivar-Riveron) have been described so far from the
   material collected in this work.},

Abstract = {The future of research in biology and medicine depends on modular
   tridimensional cell culture platforms with suitable on-demand geometries
   that can imitate any cell-specific environment with micron-size
   features. A high level of control of physico-chemical properties of the
   substrates is critical, as mechanotransduction signals are passed to the
   cells that sense their environment. The possibility to pattern nanoscale
   geometries on chip are also leading to better culture results. All these
   biomimicry parameters influence the cells phenotype, structure and
   behavior and are now opening new perspectives in 3D cell culturing for
   basic biology, medicine and drug testing applications. However, this
   growing need for on-demand 3D platforms is currently limited by two
   factors: the specificity of the commercial biochips is not suitable for
   many cell types and the high cost of technology used to design and
   fabricate custom-made substrates.
   In this work, we present the application of a simple, low-cost
   alternative technique enabling the rapid fabrication of on-demand,
   custom-made biochips for cell culture with micron-scale resolution. We
   developed a process that enables the use of low-power, low-cost lasers
   to etch on-demand micropatterns in transparent biopolymers,
   circumventing the need for high power lasers or photolithography. We
   also report the integration of embedded electronics for in situ
   monitoring or actuation and microchannels on chip. We also succeeded in
   producing localized carbon nanodomains that are enhancing cell cultures
   and allowing regionalization in 3D cell culture platforms.},

Abstract = {The oegopsid squids Abraliopsis and Pterygioteuthis are abundant and
   diverse genera with taxonomic and distributional problems.
   Identification and distribution of species in the Mexican Pacific has
   been somewhat controversial. Here are provided a large series of new
   records for Abraliopsis affinis, A. falco, Pterygioteuthis gemmata, P.
   giardi and P. hoylei from the Gulf of California and off the SW coast of
   Mexico. All five species were collected in the central or the southern
   Gulf of California, or in both. Abraliopsis affinis was found in seven
   samples with a total of 48 specimens, from 21 degrees 59' to 24 degrees
   53'12{''}N. Abraliopsis falco was much less represented in the samples
   (14 specimens) but it was found in 10 localities, four of which
   correspond to the central-southern Gulf of California (north to 27
   degrees 44'53{''}N) and six to SW Mexico (south to 16 degrees
   49'18{''}N). In the case of Pterygioteuthis gemmata, only two records
   (three specimens) were obtained, both in the SW Gulf of California,
   while P. giardi (nine specimens) records were all from the central Gulf
   of California (27 degrees 44'53{''} to 25 degrees 39'59{''}N). In the
   case of P. hoylei (nine specimens), material was obtained in six
   localities, also in a restricted latitudinal range (24 degrees 23'48{''}
   to 25 degrees 56'56{''}N).},

Abstract = {This research aimed to evaluate the potential of several native white
   rot fungi (WRF) isolated from subtropical environments of Misiones
   (Argentina) to produce different ligninolytic enzymes. Coriolus
   versicolor f. antarcticus BAFC 266, Pycnoporus sanguineus BAFC 2126 and
   Phlebia brevispora BAFC 633 showed the highest phenoloxidase activity.
   Ganoderma applanatum strain E, P. sanguineus BAFC 2126 and P. brevispora
   BAFC 633 revealed marked laccase and peroxidase activity. C. versicolor
   f. antarcticus, G. applanatum (strain A) and Trametes villosa, gave high
   positive reactions with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol oxidation at the lowest
   tested pH. C. versicolor f. antarcticus, G. applanatum strains D and F,
   T. elegans BAFC 2127 and T. villosa, showed the highest manganese
   peroxidase activity. C. versicolor f. antarcticus also produced the
   highest lignin peroxidase activity. Tyrosinase activity was mostly
   evident in G. applanatum strains (D and F) and Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium HHB 11741. Kraft liquor decolorization results were
   variable and depended on the fungus and the liquor concentration. Some
   fungi with moderate ligninolytic activity showed high decolorization
   rates (e.g. Pleurotus sajor-caju and Steccherinium sp. BAFC 1171)
   indicating the significance of additional approach to evaluate a
   potential biotechnological application.},

Abstract = {Culture of octopuses is still in an experimental stage due to a lack of
   knowledge about their digestive physiology. This study aimed to
   determine the temporality of nutrient digestion, absorption and
   assimilation in 2 species of octopus: the tropical Octopus maya (habitat
   temperature 22 to 26 degrees C) and the subtropical-temperate O. mimus
   (15 to 21 degrees C). In both species, the chyme volume displayed 2
   peaks over time along the digestive tract: one at the beginning of
   digestion and a second at the end of the digestion process. These phases
   were observed in gastric juice (GJ) enzymes, in the flow of nutrients in
   the digestive gland (DG), in the appearance of metabolites in the
   hemolymph, and in muscle protein and glycogen levels. The soluble
   nutrient flow throughout the digestive tract into the DG was similar in
   both species. How ever, intracellular digestion was different in O.
   mimus compared to O. maya; lipids were mobilized faster than proteins in
   O. mimus, whereas proteins were mobilized faster than lipids in O. maya.
   This suggests that at low temperatures, the mobilization of lipids could
   be a biological priority due to their role in membrane protection. In
   addition, O. mimus displayed more digestive enzyme activity in the GJ
   and DG compared with O. maya, suggesting that adaptive differences may
   be related to environmental temperatures.},

Abstract = {The use of the travelling wave approach for high magnetic field magnetic
   resonance imaging has been used recently with very promising results.
   This approach offer images one with greater field-of-view and a
   reasonable signal-to-noise ratio using a circular waveguide. This scheme
   has been proved to be successful at 7 T and 9.4 T with whole-body
   imager. Images have also been acquired with clinical magnetic resonance
   imaging systems whose resonant frequencies were 64 MHz and 128 MHz.
   These results motivated the use of remote detection of the magnetic
   resonance signal using a parallel-plate waveguide together with 3 T
   clinical scanners, to acquired human leg images. The cut-off frequency
   of this waveguide is zero for the principal mode, allowing us to
   overcome the barrier of transmitting waves at lower frequency than 300
   MHz or 7 T for protons. These motivated the study of remote detection
   outside the actual magnet. We performed electromagnetic field
   simulations of a parallel-plate waveguide and a phantom. The signal
   transmission was done at 128 MHz and using a circular surface coil
   located almost 200 cm away for the magnet isocentre. Numerical
   simulations demonstrated that the magnetic field of the principal mode
   propagate inside a waveguide outside the magnet. Numerical results were
   compared with previous experimental-acquired image data under similar
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The annual histological changes of the seminiferous tubules and anterior
   testicular ducts were described for the viviparous lizard, Sceloporus
   grammicus, in two populations inhabiting contrasting environments;
   relating the reproductive activity of males with temperature, rainfall
   and photoperiod for each population. Adult males were collected monthly
   in Zacualtipan and Tizayuca, Hidalgo state, Mexico. Testes and anterior
   testicular ducts were removed and fixed in formalin, dehydrated in
   alcohol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mu m and stained using
   hematoxylin-eosin. In the Zacualtipan population, the results revealed
   strong annual variations in stages of the germ cells, and diameter and
   height of the epithelia of seminiferous tubules, ductuli efferentes and
   ductus epididymis. In the Tizayuca population, the histological
   observations of the testis and anterior testicular ducts demonstrated
   spermiogenesis and spermiation throughout the year, an unusual pattern
   of reproductive activity, which had not been described previously in any
   populations of this species. The observed spermatogenesis patterns are
   not explained by a single environmental factor; but by the local set of
   environmental cues. In both populations, during spermatogenesis a single
   population of germ cells developed synchronously, followed by one
   massive spermiation event, which is characteristic of reptilian species.
   Our observations show differences between the two populations studied,
   which might be indicative of plasticity in response to local
   environmental conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {419-434},
Abstract = {The process of cell death is the mechanism through which organisms
   eliminate useless cells. Hence, it is a normal process that maintains
   homeostasis. Cell removal can be effectuated by several pathways that
   involve complex and regulated molecular events specific to each type of
   cell death. Diverse studies have evidenced different types of cell
   death: apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. This chapter presents a brief
   review of the apoptotic and autophagic cell death processes but focuses
   attention primarily on necrosis because it has previously been
   considered an accidental and uncontrolled form of cell death. More
   recent evidence, however, has shown that, under certain circumstances,
   necrosis is conducted by a controlled program called necroptosis, which
   is now included as a programmed cell death process.},

Abstract = {A study of convection in a circular two dimensional cell is presented.
   The system is heated and cooled at two diametrically opposed points on
   the edge of the circle, which are parallel or anti-parallel to gravity.
   The latter's role in the plane of the cell can be changed by tilting the
   cell. When the system is in a horizontal position, a non-trivial
   analytic solution for the temperature distribution of the quiescent
   fluid can be found. For a slight inclination, the projection of gravity
   in the plane of the cell is used as a perturbation parameter in the full
   hydrodynamic description, as the Boussinesq approximation is
   unjustified. To first order, the equations are solved for the stationary
   case and four symmetrical rolls become apparent, showing that a purely
   conductive state is impossible if gravity however small is present; an
   approximate closed analytical expression is obtained, which describes
   the four convection rolls. Further analysis is done by a direct
   numerical integration. Comparison with preliminary observations is
   mentioned. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper exposes a set of tools which can be used to quantitatively
   evaluate the required effort to update the software system that operates
   a general purpose service mobile robot. These tools are used to compare
   a Blackboard-based and a Peer-to-Peer architectures in the context of
   mobile robotics. The analysis consider the development cost for an
   update, as well as the response time for both architectures. The results
   show that it is regularly simpler to maintain a robotics software system
   with Blackboard architecture than when a Peer-to-Peer architecture is
   used. Also results show that there is no noticeable change in the
   response time or performance of the robot when using any architecture.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe the early stages of Mexican
   nuclearization that took place in contact with radioisotopes. This
   history requires a multilayered narrative with an emphasis in
   North-South asymmetric relations, and in the value of education and
   training in the creation of international asymmetrical networks.
   Radioisotopes were involved in exchanges with the United States since
   the late 1940s, but also with Canada. We also describe the context of
   implementation of Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace initiative in Mexico that
   opened the door to training programs at both the Comision Nacional de
   Energia Nuclear and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.
   Radioisotopes became the best example of the peaceful applications of
   atomic energy, and as such they fitted the Mexican nuclearization
   process that was and still is defined by its commitment to pacifism. In
   1955 Mexico became one of the 16 members of the atomic fallout network
   established by the United Nations. As part of this network, the first
   generation of Mexican (women) radio-chemists was trained. By the end of
   the 1960s, radioisotopes and biological markers were being produced in a
   research reactor, prepared and distributed by the CNEN within Mexico. We
   end up this paper with a brief reflection on North-South nuclear
   exchanges and the particularities of the Mexican case.},

Abstract = {Carnoya cepacapitatus n. sp. and C. mexicana n. sp. from the intestine
   of Anadenobolus putealis from Mexico are described herein. Specific
   characters like the number of collars and spines set these species apart
   from those previously described from the Caribbean and South American
   regions. Males of C. cepacapitatus n. sp. can be differentiated from
   those of all other described species of Carnoya from the Americas by the
   presence of a broader cephalic annule two annules posterior to the lip
   region, eight transverse rows of spines linearly arranged on cervical
   region, finely striated regions at the midventral body section and in
   the region posterior to cloacal aperture, and a pair of double
   postcloacal papillae, females by a spherical, knob-like annule posterior
   to lip region, annulated neck region with fourth annule wider than the
   other six, and 15 spined cervical collars. Males of C. mexicana n. sp.
   can be differentiated from other described species by the presence of
   minute and irregularly distributed cervical spines placed on 11 annules,
   plus an elevated lip region; females bear 15 cervical collars with
   leaf-like spines. Carnoya cepacapitatus n. sp. closely resembles C.
   caputbulla, whereas C. mexicana n. sp. resembles several species of
   Caribbean distribution, mainly C. haiti, but differs from all of them
   primarily in the number, distribution and size of the cervical spined
   collars. Females of C. cepacapitatus n. sp. resemble Asian species that
   possess a knob-like cephalic region. Carnoya mexicana n. sp. resembles
   more closely the American species of this genus based on the form of the
   cephalic region in both sexes, but especially the number and
   distribution of the spined collars in the male. Partial sequences of SSU
   and LSU are presented for females of both species.},

Abstract = {This contribution reviews and illustrates some of the key concepts of
   angular momentum theory in bases of Lame spheroconal harmonics, which
   has been developed in connection with research about the free rotations
   of asymmetric molecules. The review starts from the reparametrization of
   the Hamiltonian of the physical system, separating it into its spherical
   rotor and asymmetry distribution Hamiltonian, including their symmetries
   and commutativities; the symmetries of their common eigenfunctions and
   eigenenergies are also identified and explicitly illustrated, as
   functions of the asymmetry parameters of the molecule. The review also
   covers the identification of three sets of ladder operators for the
   rotational eigenstates of molecules with any asymmetry, and of four-step
   ladder operators for the most symmetric eigenstates in four different
   species of the most asymmetric molecules. Our most recent work
   illustrated the combined use of the four-step ladder operators and the
   cartesian components of the angular momentum operators to connect all
   the eigenstates of the most asymmetric molecules within each of the four
   different species. The reviews of the last two paragraphs include also
   pending matters in our previous works, for which the present
   contribution contains the answers: the matrix elements of the angular
   momentum operators between the rotational normalized eigenstates (1)
   with the same eigenvalue of angular momentum and different species; (2)
   with neighboring values of angular momentum l' = l +/- 1, different
   parities and species, connected by the linear momentum operators, for
   molecules of any asymmetry including the most asymmetric.},

Abstract = {The behavior of an ultracold matter wave-packet under confinement
   conditions by an impurity near the delocalization threshold is of
   fundamental importance in atomic physics, particularly in atom chip
   technology. We study the effect of a waveguide impurity on an ultracold
   matter wave-packet at the threshold of delocalization. The impurity is
   modeled by a 1D short range square well potential with depth V-0 and
   width 2R(0) coupled to a contact impurity at the center of the bend. We
   report the ground state exact solution for the time-independent
   nonlinear Schrodinger equation that describes a Bose-Einstein condensate
   at the delocalization threshold, obtaining the density profile and the
   maximum nonlinear coupling constant, g(max). This allows us to obtain
   the maximum number of atoms, N-max, that the defect potential can
   localize for the ground state. We find that for small impurity reduced
   size, xi = root V0R0, the maximum number of particles and nonlinear
   coupling constant, g(max), that characterize a contact impurity, become
   constant. For high values of xi, we recover the Thomas-Fermi result.
   With the analytic solution, we report the full width at half maximum for
   the wave-function and density profile finding a large tunneling
   probability for small confining conditions. Implications of these
   findings to atom chips are discussed.},

Abstract = {A natural wetland in Mexico City Metropolitan Area is one of the main
   suppliers of crops and flowers, and in consequence its canals hold a
   high concentration of organochlorine (OC) and organophosphorus (OP)
   pesticides. There is also an extensive population of water hyacinth
   (Eichhornia crassipes), which is considered a plague; but literature
   suggests water hyacinth may be used as a phytoremediator. This study
   demonstrates bioaccumulation difference for the OC in vivo suggesting
   their bioaccumulation is ruled by their log K-ow,K- while all the OP
   showed bioaccumulation regardless of their log K-ow. The higher
   bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of the accumulated OC pesticides cannot be
   explained by their log K-ow, suggesting that the OC pesticides may also
   be transported passively into the plant. Translocation ratios showed
   that water hyacinth is an accumulating plant with phytoremediation
   potential for all organophosphorus pesticides studied and some
   organochlorine pesticides. An equation for free water surface wetlands
   with floating macrophytes, commonly used for the construction of
   water-cleaning wetlands, showed removal of the pesticides by the wetland
   with room for improvement with appropriate management.},

   plants and are key elements in tropical forests. Here we synthesize the
   available literature on their population ecology in an attempt to find
   patterns that may characterize them. Epiphytes tend to have specialized
   pollination systems frequently involving animal vectors, resulting in a
   mixture of selfing and outcrossing that ensures abundant seed
   production. Seed dispersal is anemochorous in 84 \% of the species and
   is pivotal for the establishment of new local populations within
   metapopulation. Seed germination is highly dependent on specific
   environmental conditions, resulting in seedling establishment in
   particular microhabitats on phorophytes. Individual growth rates are
   slow and limited by the low water and nutrient availability
   characteristic of the epiphytic habitat. Population growth rates (X) are
   close to unity and depend mostly on the survival of adults. This plant
   group is highly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.},

Abstract = {Information technologies and communications (ICT) are in constant
   evolution, the arrival of multimedia to classrooms had a strong impact
   on education, where one of the first and most used tools was
   ``PowerPoint{''} of Microsoft's Family.
   Nowadays with the great technological evolution and the improvement of
   Internet connections, new tools like Pearltrees, Prezzi, SpicyNodes,
   among others, are incorporated. The educational area is linked to this
   evolution and its benefits often are compromised because the
   technological needs of students are increasing day by day, and this is
   greatly reflected in the lack of interest for certain educational issues
   or attention problems.
   This paper aims to incorporate into the classrooms the usage of
   interactive e-books as a Learning Object (OA) with the iBooks Author
   tool from Apple, this in order to assess their impact on academic
   performance in students of the Faculty of Computer Mazatlan degree in
   Information Systems Engineering specifically in Multimedia Technology I
   class, of the Autonomous University of Sinaloa in Mexico.
   This tool is intended to be a support in the teaching work, especially
   for those teachers wishing to be updated and are pending the concerns of
   students of these new generations, which are born and immersed in
   technology. One benefit of this material is the interactive part, which
   helps in promoting meaningful learning and even autonomous.
   Every student has a different learning style and for that reason this
   didactic material pretends to adapt on the needs of every single
   student, one of the main problems for this case could be the pace of
   learning. This didactic material is composed of lectures on the theme
   supported by images, graphics, 2d or 3d animations, videos, audios and
   exercises in each subject to assess knowledge acquired in students.
   The purpose is to make a comparison between the results of academic
   achievement in students who were working with the interactive electronic
   book (generated with iBooks Author) and students who continue working
   with obsolete and not so new tools, as it is PowerPoint. Based on that,
   compare the level of achievement for each case of study, and determine
   if is feasible to apply in other areas of the curriculum of the Faculty,
   the ones that could be benefited are those which are too theoretical or
   complexes.
   This research will be of documentary and experimental type, working with
   two groups, one of control group and the other one of experimental
   group, tests will be applied in order to evaluate the significant
   progress of students and some interviews will be applied to assess the
   qualitative level of acceptance of this tool and ease of use.},

Title = {Comparison of Metabolic Pathways in Escherichia coli by Using
   Genetic Algorithms},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {277-285},
Abstract = {In order to understand how cellular metabolism has taken its modern
   form, the conservation and variations between metabolic pathways were
   evaluated by using a genetic algorithm(GA). The GA approach considered
   information on the complete metabolism of the bacterium Escherichia coli
   K-12, as deposited in the KEGG database, and the enzymes belonging to a
   particular pathway were transformed into enzymatic step sequences by
   using the breadth-first search algorithm. These sequences represent
   contiguous enzymes linked to each other, based on their catalytic
   activities as they are encoded in the Enzyme Commission numbers. In a
   posterior step, these sequences were compared using a GA in an
   all-against-all (pairwise comparisons) approach. Individual reactions
   were chosen based on their measure of fitness to act as parents of
   offspring, which constitute the new generation. The sequences compared
   were used to construct a similarity matrix (of fitness values) that was
   then considered to be clustered by using a k-medoids algorithm. A total
   of 34 clusters of conserved reactions were obtained, and their sequences
   were finally aligned with a multiple-sequence alignment GA optimized to
   align all the reaction sequences included in each group or cluster. From
   these comparisons, maps associated with the metabolism of similar
   compounds also contained similar enzymatic step sequences, reinforcing
   the Patchwork Model for the evolution of metabolism in E. coli K-12, an
   observation that can be expanded to other organisms, for which there is
   metabolism information. Finally, our mapping of these reactions is
   discussed, with illustrations from a particular case. (C) 2015 Ortegon

Abstract = {Nowadays, there is textual content which is hosted on different websites
   worldwide, this content can be accessed through any web browser and can
   be found on different formats, the most popular on web sites dedicated
   to the scientific research area are HTML, PDF and plain text.
   This information can be accessed by anyone with minimal computer skills,
   from any location and at any time, this is the reason why the
   information repositories have been useful for the development and
   creation of cutting-edge research from around the world.
   The main problem on this research focuses on the fact that this content
   has very few features that could provide access to people with visual
   disabilities, which they also have the need to access to information
   hosted on online websites.
   In this sense, the design of a tool will help to facilitate
   accessibility to such content through audio textual description and its
   online work will enable its access from any operating system and/or
   device with Internet access.
   For the proper operation of this tool and a best distribution along the
   internet, it needs the integration of new Internet tags on future
   versions of HTML, with these new tags the websites will be able to
   automatically detect when a person with special cognitive abilities
   requires from a specific tool.
   A hard work is required between various entities such as web browsers
   developers, web servers developers and also websites designers, because
   when users surf on the Internet, these have to emit some special
   variables with their web browsers. Therefore, websites will have a
   method to identify them, through ``HTTP\_USER\_AGENT{''} variable, which
   can be parsed to get the value of the special variables and thus deploy
   on the website special tools depending on what kind of special ability
   has the user declared on his web browser.
   These inclusion tools will only be displayed to people who have this
   credential enabled in their web browsers. An example is when a custom
   web site is displayed depending on what kind of operative system is
   running on your computer and what kind of device visits the web site.
   This paper is the first of several publications planned to be performed
   by the Autonomous University of Sinaloa. The purpose of this research is
   to make distance education more inclusive.},

Title = {Identification of proteins associated with amyloidosis by polarity index
   method},
Journal = {ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-55},
Abstract = {There is a natural protein form, insoluble and resistant to proteolysis,
   adopted by many proteins independently of their amino acid sequences via
   specific misfolding-aggregation process. This dynamic process occurs in
   parallel with or as an alternative to physiologic folding, generating
   toxic protein aggregates that are deposited and accumulated in various
   organs and tissues. These proteinaceous deposits typically represent
   bundles of beta-sheet-enriched fibrillar species known as the amyloid
   fibrils that are responsible for serious pathological conditions,
   including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases, grouped under
   the term amyloidoses. The proteins that might adopt this fibrillar
   conformation are some globular proteins and natively unfolded (or
   intrinsically disordered) proteins. Our work shows that intrinsically
   disordered and intrinsically ordered proteins can be reliably
   identified, discriminated, and differentiated by analyzing their
   polarity profiles generated using a computational tool known as the
   polarity index method (Polanco \& Samaniego, 2009; Polanco et al., 2012;
   2013; 2013a; 2014; 2014a; 2014b; 2014c; 2014d). We also show that
   proteins expressed in neurons can be differentiated from proteins in
   these two groups based on their polarity profiles, and also that this
   computational tool can be used to identify proteins associated with
   amyloidoses. The efficiency of the proposed method is high (i.e. 70\%)
   as evidenced by the analysis of peptides and proteins in the APD2
   database (2012), AVPpred database (2013), and CPPsite database (2013),
   the set of selective antibacterial peptides from del Rio et al. (2001),
   the sets of natively unfolded and natively folded proteins from Oldfield
   et al. (2005), the set of human revised proteins expressed in neurons,
   and non-human revised proteins expressed in neurons, from the Uniprot
   database (2014), and also the set of amyloidogenic proteins from the
   AmyPDB database (2014).},

Abstract = {With almost one third of the world population infected, tuberculosis is
   one of the most devastating diseases worldwide and it is a major threat
   to any healthcare system. With the mathematical-computational method
   named ``Polarity Index Method{''}, already published by this group, we
   identified, with high accuracy (70\%), proteins related to Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis bacteria virulence pathway from the Tuberculist Database.
   The test considered the totality of proteins cataloged in the main
   domains: fungi, bacteria, and viruses from three databases:
   Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD2), Tuberculist Database, Uniprot
   Database, and four antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: PstS-1,
   38-kDa, 19-kDa, and H37Rv ORF. The method described was calibrated with
   each database to achieve the same performance, showing a high percentage
   of coincidence in the identification of proteins associated with
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria virulence pathway located in the
   Tuberculist Database, and identifying a polar pattern regardless of the
   group studied. This method has already been used in the identification
   of diverse groups of proteins and peptides, showing that it is an
   effective discriminant. Its metric considers only one physico-chemical
   property, i.e. polarity.},

Abstract = {Among the insects, lepidopterans form the second most diverse group,
   with over 155,000 described species. Research on Lepidoptera has a long
   tradition in several fields, including taxonomy, phylogeny, ecology,
   population genetics, evolutionary biology, speciation, physiology,
   development and gene regulation, host-plant and insect-parasite
   interactions, and, in recent decades, genomics. These studies and
   genomic resources for them are widely distributed and often widespread
   in various databases. In this chapter, we analyze the state of the art
   for genomic resources for Lepidoptera in GenBank for the following
   genes: elongation factor-1 alpha, wingless, cytochrome c oxidase I,
   ribosomal DNA and RNA, and in general a number of other protein and
   enzyme entries; complete mitochondrial genomes; complete nuclear
   genomes; and published work on barcode methodology. This information
   will help researchers find gaps in the available resources and direct
   research efforts in these areas.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, biofuels represent a large part of renewable energies destined
   to substitute fossil fuels, and to reduce the negative impact on the
   environment. Bioethanol is obtained by alcoholic fermentation, and is
   used pure or mixed with other petroleum derivatives as fuel. Use,
   manipulation, storage and transport of these substances, at any scale,
   demand the implementation of materials, such as aluminum, that has
   excellent mechanical properties, as well as low density. Generally,
   these characteristics are improved by alloying aluminum with silicon (in
   order to decrease the thermal expansion coefficient and increase wear
   resistance) and magnesium (to increase hardness of the material).
   Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical spectroscopy impedance
   techniques were used on this research, in order to determine the
   corrosion resistance of Al-10wt.\% Si, Al-12wt.\% Si, Al-2\% Mg and
   Al-4wt.\% Mg alloys in an alcoholic electrolyte (bioethanol of Misiones
   province, Argentina industry). Comparing to pure aluminum,
   aluminum-silicon alloys presented better corrosion resistance. On the
   other hand, aluminum-magnesium alloys didn't have such improvement. By
   using optical metallographic microscope, no differences were found on
   the surfaces of alloys after being exposed to the alcoholic electrolyte.

Title = {Effect of the management of a Natural Protected Area in the landscape of
   the mangrove forest in the Yucatan Peninsula},
Journal = {HIDROBIOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {203-211},
Abstract = {Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) are one of the main conservation tools
   used to maintain biodiversity. Due to the limitations on the
   anthropogenic activities that are generally associated with these tools,
   it is important to determine their efficiency in order to justify and/or
   modify their operation. This study evaluates the effect of the
   management of the ``El Palmar{''} state reserve, which was established
   23 years ago, by comparing the landscape characteristics of the mangrove
   forest of the Natural Protected Area (NPA) and the adjacent area that
   has no historical conservation status. A Geographic Information System
   (GIS) was used, as well as remote sensing techniques, based on the
   hierarchical analysis of quantitative characteristics of the habitat,
   the spectral similarity, contextual edition and the supervised
   classification of a multispectral Spot 5 image, to compare the area,
   fragmentation and compactness of ten types of mangrove habitats between
   the NPA and the adjacent area. The contrasted regions present the same
   general fragmentation pattern (p>0.05). However, when comparing the
   types of habitat, significant differences were observed (p<0.05) in the
   fragmentation, the area and the compactness of certain types of habitat.
   The observed differences do not indicate a clear effect of the protected
   area management strategies in the structure of the landscape and are
   possibly more related to the local conditions, ecological processes, and
   the natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. Our results highlight the
   importance of adjusting the management strategies of the NPA in such a
   manner that they have a positive effect in the integrity of the
   mangrove's forest.},

Abstract = {A new species of Jumping-bristletail, Neomachilellus
   (Praeneomachilellus) ezetaelenensis sp. nov. (Microcoryphia:
   Meinertellidae), is described from the Miocene amber collected in the
   Mountains of Chiapas, southwestern Mexico. This study is based on amber
   microcoryphian insects newly recovered from rocks near the towns of
   Simojovel, Totolapa and Estrella de Belen. These amber sites are part of
   a Conservation Lagerstatte with remarkable preserved paleobiota. On the
   basis on male and female specimens, N. (Praeneomachilellus)
   ezetaelenensis sp. nov., is illustrated and diagnosed herein by a
   combination of diagnostic characters. Morphological data were collected
   using high-resolution microscopy with regular to adapted infrared-pass
   lens. The subgenus Praeneomachilellus STURM \& POINAR, 1997 into the
   genus Neomachilellus WYGODZINSKY, 1953 comprises one described fossil
   species from the Miocene Dominican Republic amber and one extant species
   from Puerto Rico. Thus, N. (Praeneomachilellus) ezetaelenensis is the
   first species of this group to be described in the Chiapas amber that
   adds insights into Microcoryphia biodiversity at the southernmost part
   of North America.},

Title = {The COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database: an open online repository for plant

Abstract = {1. Schedules of survival, growth and reproduction are key life-history
   traits. Data on how these traits vary among species and populations are
   fundamental to our understanding of the ecological conditions that have
   shaped plant evolution. Because these demographic schedules determine
   population growth or decline, such data help us understand how different
   biomes shape plant ecology, how plant populations and communities
   respond to global change and how to develop successful management tools
   for endangered or invasive species.
   2. Matrix population models summarize the life cycle components of
   survival, growth and reproduction, while explicitly acknowledging
   heterogeneity among classes of individuals in the population. Matrix
   models have comparable structures, and their emergent measures of
   population dynamics, such as population growth rate or mean life
   expectancy, have direct biological interpretations, facilitating
   comparisons among populations and species.
   3. Thousands of plant matrix population models have been parameterized
   from empirical data, but they are largely dispersed through
   peer-reviewed and grey literature, and thus remain inaccessible for
   synthetic analysis. Here, we introduce the COMPADRE Plant Matrix
   Database version 3.0, an open-source online repository containing 468
   studies from 598 species world-wide (672 species hits, when accounting
   for species studied in more than one source), with a total of 5621
   matrices. COMPADRE also contains relevant ancillary information (e.g.
   ecoregion, growth form, taxonomy, phylogeny) that facilitates
   interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived
   from the matrices.
   4. Synthesis. Large collections of data allow broad questions to be
   addressed at the global scale, for example, in genetics (GENBANK),
   functional plant ecology (TRY, BIEN, D3) and grassland community ecology
   (NUTNET). Here, we present COMPADRE, a similarly data-rich and
   ecologically relevant resource for plant demography. Open access to this
   information, its frequent updates and its integration with other online
   resources will allow researchers to address timely and important
   ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Abstract = {A photonic crystal is formed by an alternating arrangement of two
   dielectric with different permittivity, which are assumed as constant
   and with real values. In a linear dielectric media, nonmagnetic,
   inhomogeneous with a real permittivity, the harmonic magnetic field
   satisfies an eigenvalues equation where the operator over the magnetic
   field is linear and hermitian. We can simulate a PC with absorption by
   inserting slices with complex permittivity dielectric. In this case the
   problem is redefined using a harmonic electric field, for which a
   generalized eigenvalues equation is obtained. Taking into account
   properties of the electric field is possible to demonstrate that the
   operator over the electric field is linear and hermitian. In this work
   the characteristics of this operator are determined, which allow us to
   treat numerically the problem of the electromagnetic radiation
   transmission by a one dimensional photonic crystal in TIIz range.},

Journal = {BOSQUE},

Abstract = {Studies that evaluate conservation status of ecosystems in Mexico often
   lack the integration of some theoretical bases as well as some
   methodological tools that landscape ecology offers. This situation
   imposes limitations for the implementation of more adequate management,
   restoration and conservation strategies. In this study we propose a four
   stage method in order to characterize the biophysical environment and to
   estimate the vegetation conservation status in a highly environmentally
   heterogeneous basin, under strong anthropogenic pressure. The stages
   were: 1) delimitation and characterization of environmental units based
   on biophysical conditions, 2) quantification of vegetation structure and
   composition, 3) classification of the species according to their
   functional responses, and 4) evaluation of the conservation status based
   on the community structure and composition. As a result, biophysical
   units showed differences in richness, diversity, and in the importance
   index values of native, weed and introduced species. Plant functional
   groups were identified; they comprised different environmental responses
   in a conservation gradient in the biophysical units. Through the
   canonical correspondence analysis, it was demonstrated that composition
   is mainly related to the light regime, temperature, humidity and some
   soil conditions. Significant differences in the conservation status of
   the biophysical units were found. Therefore vegetation composition is an
   important indicator of the conservation status; its definition helps to
   generate punctual strategies for conservation planning.},

   instability in silicene},
Journal = {PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Pages = {7624-7628},
Abstract = {Silicene, the graphene-like crystal formed by the Si hexagonal lattice,
   presents a periodic buckled structure whose origin is due to the pseudo
   Jahn-Teller instability on each of its planar six membered rings. This
   has been attributed to the coupling of the planar D-6h ground state with
   the first b(2g) excited state through a b(2g) vibrational mode. Here we
   show, by explicitly calculating the vibronic coupling constants through
   a complete study of the PJT effect, that the vibronic coupling of the
   ground state with only one excited state to explain the planar
   instability is inconsistent with the linear multilevel PJT effect
   theory. It is also shown that in order to have consistency, the PJT
   model should include the next excited state, which is symmetry
   compatible coupled to the puckering mode. This is done by the analysis,
   based on DFT and TDDFT calculations, of the vibronic instability of the
   ground state of hexasilabenzene, the basic silicon hydrogenated
   hexagonal ring unit defining silicene.},

Abstract = {Hematite and maghemite nanoparticles embedded in silica and titanium

   addition of PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers in a concentration of 12.1
   wt\% PF127 (SiO2) and 4.1 wt\% P123 (TiO2) produces very stable magnetic
   particles with average size between 5 and 10 nm. These neutral
   surfactants allow the control of the morphology and crystal phase of
   these magnetic nanoparticles, and stabilize the nanoparticles to avoid
   their aggregation. The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction,
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and infrared and Mo ``
   ssbauer spectroscopies. Mo `` ssbauer results show that maghemite is the
   majority species in the SiO2 matrix (61.3 \%) and TiO2 (63.0 \%),

Abstract = {The rare earth region of the nuclear landscape is characterized by a
   large collectivity observed. The microscopic studies are difficult to
   perform in the region due to the enormous size of the valence spaces.
   The use of symmetries based models avoids that problem, because the
   symmetry allows to choose the most relevant degrees of freedom for the
   system under consideration. We present theoretical results for
   electromagnetic properties in Dy160-168 isotopes employing the
   pseudo-SU(3) model. In particular, we study the B(E2) inter-band
   transition strengths between the ground state, gamma and beta-bands. The
   model succesfully describes in a systematic way rotational features in
   these nuclei and allows to extrapolate toward the midshell nucleus
   Dy-170.},

   reflectivity measurements to inspect the deposition of metallic
   nanoparticles on a flat surface. We use a theoretical model for the
   coherent reflectance of a disordered monolayer of particles to calculate
   the reflectivity of an air-glass interface with silver and gold
   nanoparticles deposited randomly on it as a function of the angle of
   incidence and wavelength of light. Assuming reasonable noise scenarios,
   we estimate the minimum detectable surface coverage fractions by the
   nanoparticles.},

Title = {Two dimensional kicked quantum Ising model: dynamical phase transitions},
Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Using an efficient one and two qubit gate simulator operating on
   graphical processing units, we investigate ergodic properties of a
   quantum Ising spin 1/2 model on a two-dimensional lattice, which is
   periodically driven by a delta-pulsed transverse magnetic field. We
   consider three different dynamical properties: (i) level density, (ii)
   level spacing distribution of the Floquet quasienergy spectrum, and
   (iii) time-averaged autocorrelation function of magnetization
   components. Varying the parameters of the model, we found transitions
   between ordered (non-ergodic) and quantum chaotic (ergodic) phases, but
   the transitions between flat and non-flat spectral density do not
   correspond to transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic local
   observables. Even more surprisingly, we found good agreement of level
   spacing distribution with the Wigner surmise of random matrix theory for
   almost all values of parameters except where the model is essentially
   non-interacting, even in regions where local observables are not ergodic
   or where spectral density is non-flat. These findings question the
   versatility of the interpretation of level spacing distribution in
   many-body systems and stress the importance of the concept of locality.},

Abstract = {The genus Codatractus Lindsey, 1921 (Hesperiidae: Eudaminae) includes 17
   taxa; three are endemic to Mexico (C. yucatanus, C. cyledis, and C.
   uvydixa). The genus is distributed in the Neotropical and southern
   Neartic region, from southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, across
   Mexico and Central America, to relatively dry regions of Ecuador,
   Venezuela, Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. We analyzed the geographical
   distribution of the genus, as correlated with climatic and physiographic
   factors, based on records from collections, literature, web sites, and
   field research. Results showed that the greatest number of species occur
   between 15 and 21 degrees, below the Tropic of Cancer, between 0-1800 m,
   and are associated with dry forest. The greatest concentration of
   species occurs in the Balsas Depression and Mexican Pacific Coast. The
   distribution, diversity, and degree of endemism indicate the genus
   diversified in Mexico.},

Abstract = {We described and compared the chorion morphology of 22 species in 12
   genera of the subfamily Coliadinae, collected from 80 females in Mexico,
   Colombia, and Ecuador. Their characterization and ilustration include
   the main structural features of the eggs: colors, shapes, sizes, and
   diversity of ornamentation or reticula; possibly from the most
   widespread in Pieridae (polygon grid) to the derivatives Coliadinae
   (with the formation of axes and ribs relatively reduced number). We
   describe for the first time microreticulum associated with the
   macroreticulum.},

Abstract = {The disturbances on coral reefs increase the competition for space
   between organisms. This study evaluated the effect of algal turfs on the
   growth and survival of the coral Pocillopora capitata. The experimental
   work was to unite dead branches -colonized by algae- and live with live
   coral branches in 2 types of adhesion -lateral and apical-, in 2 seasons
   -rainy and dry- in the Mexican tropical Pacific. The information was
   obtained through comparative pictures between the start and end of the
   experiment for each season. The results show that the coral branches
   growth did not change significantly despite the manipulation, the
   injuries -apical cut and adhesion- and by contact with algal turfs,
   survival values obtained for the branches of coral between 65 and 100\%.
   Thus, the results presented here, and the results of other studies have
   found some qualities of P. capitata as rapid growth, ability and to
   manipulation resistance, also the turf algae overgrow resistance, and in
   addition their membership to a family used in the recovery of reefs make
   to this species useful in restoration projects, in degraded coral
   communities of the Mexican tropical Pacific.},

Title = {Transport properties of Levy walks: An analysis in terms of multistate
   processes},
Journal = {EPL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {108},
Number = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Continuous time random walks combining diffusive and ballistic regimes
   are introduced to describe a class of Levy walks on lattices. By
   including exponentially distributed waiting times separating the
   successive jump events of a walker, we are led to a description of such
   Levy walks in terms of multistate processes whose time-evolution is
   shown to obey a set of coupled delay differential equations. Using
   simple arguments, we obtain asymptotic solutions to these equations and
   rederive the scaling laws for the mean squared displacement of such
   processes. Our calculation includes the computation of all relevant
   transport coefficients in terms of the parameters of the models.

Title = {The PREDICTS database: a global database of how local terrestrial

Abstract = {Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing
   anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation,
   pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases
   of species' threat status or population time series are dominated by
   charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and
   biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of
   biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of
   historical declines and to project - and avert - future declines. We
   describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from
   78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing
   spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different
   intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites
   around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of
   814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and
   16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1\% of
   the total number of all species described, and more than 1\% of the
   described species within many taxonomic groups - including flowering
   plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles,
   lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added
   to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative
   than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends
   and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS
   project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing
   Terrestrial Systems - ). We make site-level summary data available
   alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in
   2015.},

Title = {Evaluating the transport in small-world and scale-free networks},
Journal = {CHAOS SOLITONS \& FRACTALS},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {We present a study of some properties of transport in small-world and
   scale-free networks. Particularly, we compare two types of transport:
   subject to friction (electrical case) and in the absence of friction
   (maximum flow). We found that in clustered networks based on the
   Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, for both transport types the small-world
   configurations exhibit the best trade-off between local and global
   levels. For non-clustered WS networks the local transport is independent
   of the rewiring parameter, while the transport improves globally.
   Moreover, we analyzed both transport types in scale-free networks
   considering tendencies in the assortative or disassortative mixing of
   nodes. We construct the distribution of the conductance G and flow F to
   evaluate the effects of the assortative (disassortative) mixing, finding
   that for scale-free networks, as we introduce different levels of the
   degree-degree correlations, the power-law decay in the conductances is
   altered, while for the flow, the power-law tail remains unchanged. In
   addition, we analyze the effect on the conductance and the flow of the
   minimum degree and the shortest path between the source and destination
   nodes, finding notable differences between these two types of transport.

Title = {Molecular phylogenetics and morphology of Beaucarnea (Ruscaceae)
   as distinct from Nolina, and the submersion of Calibanus
   into Beaucarnea},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {63},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1193-1211},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite the economic importance and longstanding worldwide
   commercialization of representatives of the Beaucarnea lineage, it
   remains poorly known systematically. One of the main systematic problems
   is lack of certainty regarding the validity of the genus itself. Some
   authors consider Beaucarnea a synonym of its close relative Nolina,
   whereas others consider Beaucarnea a distinct genus. In addition to the
   Beaucarnea vs. Nolina controversy, the boundary between Beaucarnea and
   Calibanus is an issue that has not yet been addressed. Here we show that
   Beaucarnea is a well-supported entity, distinct from Nolina on molecular
   and morphological grounds. Additionally, we demonstrate the absence of
   reciprocal monophyly between Beaucarnea and Calibanus and formally
   include Calibanus within Beaucarnea. These decisions were based on
   maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum likelihood analyses of datasets
   including ten species of Beaucarnea, two species of Calibanus, six
   species of Nolina, and five species of Dasylirion, with sequences from
   the nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F and ycfl regions. Our taxonomic
   decisions were also based on morphological observations of herbarium
   specimens and on the literature. We illustrate the diagnostic features
   of the genera with phylogenetic character mapping. Finally, we offer a
   redescription of Beaucarnea to accommodate the former Calibanus species
   and give a key to the taxonomically valid Beaucarnea species.},

Title = {Dew condensation on desert beetle skin},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Some tenebrionind beetles inhabiting the Namib desert are known for
   using their body to collect water droplets from wind-blown fogs. We aim
   to determine whether dew water collection is also possible for desert
   insects. For this purpose, we investigated the infra-red emissivity, and
   the wetting and structural properties, of the surface of the elytra of a
   preserved specimen of Physasterna cribripes (Tenebrionidae) beetle,
   where the macro-structure appears as a series of ``bumps{''}, with
   ``valleys{''} between them. Dew formation experiments were carried out
   in a condensation chamber. The surface properties (infra-red emissivity,
   wetting properties) were dominated by the wax at the elytra surface and,
   to a lower extent, its micro-structure. We performed scanning electron
   microscope on histological sections and determined the infra-red
   emissivity using a scanning pyrometer. The emissivity measured (0.95 +/-
   0.07 between 8-14 mu m) was close to the black body value. Dew formation
   occurred on the insect's elytra, which can be explained by these surface
   properties. From the surface coverage of the condensed drops it was
   found that dew forms primarily in the valleys between the bumps. The
   difference in droplet nucleation rate between bumps and valleys can be
   attributed to the hexagonal microstructure on the surface of the
   valleys, whereas the surface of the bumps is smooth. The drops can slide
   when they reach a critical size, and be collected at the insect's mouth.},

Abstract = {Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) baiomydis n. sp., an intestinal
   parasite of the northern pygmy mouse, Baiomys taylori (Cricetidae),
   collected in La Yerbabuena, Colima, Mexico, is described herein.
   Specimens were studied using light and scanning electronic microscopy.
   This is the 19th species of the subgenus Paucipectines described
   worldwide and the fourth collected in Mexico. It is differentiated from
   the remaining species in the subgenus by having 25 perioral denticles,
   arranged in a triangle (seven on each lateroventral margin, and eleven
   on the dorsal margin), and 10 pairs of caudal papillae.},

Abstract = {Free-living amoebae (FLA) are protozoa that are widely distributed in
   nature. They are important in the cycling of nutrients in aquatic food
   chains, but their distribution in natural aquatic environments is not
   well known. We conducted a survey to determine the presence and
   distribution of FLA and their relation to some physicochemical
   parameters in streams of the Mexico Basin in Central Mexico. Thirty-two
   sites from 18 streams were sampled. Samples were centrifuged and
   cultured onto NNA-media to isolate amoebae. Identifications were based
   on morphology. The pathogenicity of Acanthamoeba isolates was tested.
   Oxygen saturation, temperature, pH, specific conductance, water flow,
   dissolved reactive phosphorus, nitrites, nitrates, ammonia, dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen and coliforms were determined. One hundred-and-twenty
   FLA representing 18 genera were identified. The most frequent genera
   were Vannella, Rosculus and Acanthamoeba. The frequency of potentially
   pathogenic FLA was low and only 3 Acanthamoeba isolates were invasive in
   mice. The highest species richness of FLA was found in streams located
   into agriculture activity areas and those close to small villages that
   discharge wastewater into them. Water temperatures were always below 17
   degrees C. Oxygen saturation and pH were within the limits for the
   growth of most FLA. The presence of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria was low;
   nevertheless, they include potentially pathogenic species and can act as
   vectors and reservoirs for microbial pathogens and can produce human
   infections. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Subsurface drainage systems are used to control the depth of the water
   table and to reduce or prevent soil salinity. Water flow in these
   systems is described by the Boussinesq Equation, and the
   Advection-Dispersion Equation coupled with the Boussinesq Equation is
   used to study the solute transport. The objective of this study was to
   propose a finite difference solution of the Advection-Dispersion
   Equation using a lineal radiation condition in the drains. The
   equations' parameters were estimated from a methodology based on the
   granulometric curve and inverse problems. The algorithm needs the water
   flow values, which were calculated with the Boussinesq Equation, where a
   fractal radiation condition and variable drainable porosity were
   applied. To evaluate the solution descriptive capacity, a laboratory
   drainage experiment was used. In the experiment, the pH, temperature,
   and electric conductivity of drainage water were measured to find the
   salt's concentration. The salts concentration evolution was reproduced
   using the finite difference solution of the Advection-Dispersion
   Equation, and the dispersivity parameter was found by inverse modelling.
   The numerical solution was used to simulate the leaching of saline soil.
   The result showed that this solution could be used as a new tool for the
   design of agricultural drainage systems, enabling the optimal
   development of crops according to their water needs and the degree of
   tolerance to salinity.},

Abstract = {Many carnivores require large ranges to meet their ecological and
   energetic needs; however, anthropogenic changes threaten species and
   their habitats. Camera traps have been used to effectively collect data
   on carnivores in a variety of habitat types; however, a single survey
   effort is typically limited to species that have similar body size,
   habitat use and movement patterns, and individual identification of
   animals is not always possible. We evaluated whether scat detection dogs
   could effectively survey for 4 wide-ranging felids that vary in these
   characteristics: jaguars (Panthera onca), pumas (Puma concolor), ocelots
   (Leopardus pardalis) and oncillas (Leopardus tigrinus). From June to
   October 2009 and May to August 2011, a detection dog-handler team
   detected 588 scats, from which 176 unique genotypes were detected. We
   assigned sex to 84.7\% of the genotyped scats and identified 55
   individuals multiple times. The effectiveness of these noninvasive
   techniques (detection dogs and genetic analyses of scat) not only opens
   the door for additional studies in areas that were previously difficult
   or impossible with standard survey techniques, but also provides
   conservationists with a set of tools that overcome some of the
   limitations associated with the use of camera traps alone.},

Abstract = {Natural hybridization between an insular endemic species and a widely
   distributed congener may endanger the endemic through genetic
   assimilation or outbreeding depression. Furthermore, hybrids can exhibit
   complex morphological variation, causing taxonomic problems in the
   identification of the involved taxa. In this work, we used a combination
   of leaf morphological and molecular markers (RAPD) to establish the
   differentiation between Psidium sp. aff. sartorianum and the insular
   endemic P. socorrense. It was also determined if hybridization between
   these taxa occurs in the southern slope of Isla Socorro, Mexico. Plant
   collection was carried along an altitudinal gradient (100-800 m). We
   collected eight populations separated 100 m a.s.l. apart from each
   other; 25 individuals were collected per population. Psidium socorrense
   and P. sp. aff. sartorianum differed significantly in all but two
   morphological characters measured. Also, a high number of diagnostic
   RAPD markers were found for each taxon. These results suggest that two
   Psidium species occur at Isla Socorro. Furthermore, both morphological
   and RAPD markers revealed a hybrid zone located in the southern slope of
   Isla Socorro (400-700 m a.s.l.) with an asymmetrical pattern of gene
   flow towards P. socorrense. We suggest that the disturbance caused by
   the sheep population in the mixed stand favors the establishment of
   hybrids. We further discuss whether hybridization represents a threat to
   the insular endemic P. socorrense.},

Abstract = {Bahia de la Ascension (BA) is a shallow, mangrove-fringed coastal bay
   connected to the Caribbean through two inlets, outlined by the
   Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. This work represents an initial
   investigation of the relative contribution of hydrometeorological and
   hydrodynamic forcing on salinity variation in this lagoon. Our objective
   is to assess the sensitivity of the salinity in BA to fluctuations in
   freshwater inflow and coastal oceanography. Two field trips were
   undertaken during rainy and dry seasons in 2007. Surface salinity was
   mapped across the system and CTD deployments carried out within BA and
   in the sea end-member to characterize temperature, conductivity, and
   water level. Also, cross-sectional CTD profiles were implemented to
   examine vertical stratification. The water balance indicated that 16 \%
   of rainfall over the drainage basin (DB) becomes groundwater discharge
   plus surface runoff into BA during dry season, while 68 \% of the
   precipitation input to the DB is supplied through groundwater-surface
   runoff to the bay during rainfalls. This combined inflow showed larger
   fluctuations than direct rainfall and, thus, has a greater potential to
   alter the seasonal salinity variations within BA. The tidal signal is
   selectively attenuated within BA, as diurnal frequencies are more
   readily filtered out than semidiurnal frequencies. Mesohaline conditions
   in the southwest bay are associated with freshwater sources, while
   saline water masses in the inlet are influenced by prevalent SE winds in
   the region and tidal phase, establishing a strong horizontal SW-NE
   estuarine salinity gradient.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable
   neurodevelopmental disorder. The determination of the clinical features,
   adversity factors and level of functioning in siblings of probands with
   ADHD, known as a high risk (ADHD R Sib), could help us to establish the
   risk to which they are subjected.
   Objective
   To determine the frequency of ADHD and other psychiatric disorders in R
   Sib. Secondary objectives were to establish the psychosocial adversity
   factors that predict ADHD R Sib and determine the magnitude of effect on
   performance and other psychiatric disorders when siblings have ADHD (R
   Sib +) compared to those without ADHD (R Sib -).
   Material and methods
   This multicenter study is descriptive, transversal and analytical. The
   sample (n=84) was formed by adolescent siblings of probands with ADHD
   who shared both parents.
   Results
   While 45.2\% (n=38) had ADHD, 17.9\% (n=15) had no psychiatric disorder.
   Being a R Sib + increased at least four times the likelihood of having
   oppositional defiant disorder (OR=4.3, 95\% CI 1.3-14.8). These data
   remained significant when adjusted for sex, age and number of
   adversities (RM 95=3, 1.8-10.9\%). Being a R Sib+ increased almost five
   times the probability of academic dysfunction (OR=4.84, 95\% CI
   1.41-16.63). The overall average was 3.3 adversities (SD=1.4).
   Psychopathology in both parents was found in 51.2\% Of the sample
   (ES=0.055). Severe family dysfunction increased 2.5 times the
   probability of having ADHD in a R Sib (95\% CI, 1.06-6.25). When
   comparing the groups with three Or more psychosocial adversities, there
   were no significant differences (81.6\% vs. 65.2\%, p=0.14).
   Conclusions
   The clinical study of R Sib for ADHD is necessary clue to the different
   implications in terms of prevention, early care and prognosis
   improvement of these patients.},

Abstract = {The influence of sea level variations due to tides and wave setup on
   turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was observed at a point source submarine
   groundwater discharge in a fringing coral reef lagoon. Tidal and wave
   setup variations modulated speed, TKE, TKE dissipation, and water
   temperature and salinity at the buoyant jet. The primary driver of jet
   TKE and speed variations was tides, while wave setup was a minor
   contributor. An inverse relationship between surface elevation and TKE
   was explained with an exponential equation based on sea level
   variations. During low tides, peak jet speeds (up to 0.3 m s(-1)) and
   TKE per unit mass (up to 0.4 m(2) s(-2)) were observed. As high tide
   approached, the jet produced minimum TKE of similar to 0.003 m(2) s(-2)
   and TKE dissipation ranged from 2 to 8x10(-4) m(2) s(-3). This
   demonstrated the sensitivity of the jet discharge to tides despite the
   small tidal range (< 20 cm). Jet temperatures and salinities displayed
   semidiurnal oscillations with minimum salinity and temperature values
   during maximum discharge. Jet salinities increased throughout low tides
   while temperatures decreased. This pattern suggested the jet conduit was
   connected to a stratified cavity within the aquifer containing cool
   fresh water over cool salty water. As low tides progressed, jet outflow
   increased in salinity because of the mixing within the conduit, while
   lower jet temperatures suggested water coming from further or deeper in
   the aquifer. The presence of such a cavity has been recently confirmed
   by divers.},

Abstract = {Diseases of viral origin in humans are among the most serious threats to
   health and the global economy. As recent history has shown the virus has
   a high pandemic potential, among other reasons, due to its ability to
   spread by air, hence the identification, investigation, containment, and
   treatment of viral diseases should be considered of paramount
   importance. In this sense, the bioinformatics research has focused on
   finding fast and efficient algorithms that can identify highly toxic
   antiviral peptides and to serve as a first filter, so that trials in the
   laboratory are substantially reduced. The work presented here
   contributes to this effort through the use of an algorithm already
   published by this team, called polarity index method, which identifies
   with high efficiency antiviral peptides from the exhaustive analysis of
   the polar profile, using the linear sequence of the peptide. The test
   carried out included all peptides in APD2 Database and 60 antiviral
   peptides identified by Kumar and co-workers (Nucleic Acids Res 40:
   W199-204, 2012), to build its AVPpred algorithm. The validity of the
   method was focused on its discriminating capacity so we included the 15
   sub-classifications of both Databases.},

Abstract = {Community structure of soil arthropods associated to Pittocaulon
   (Senecio) praecox was investigated in two sites with different vegetal
   cover in El Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve, South of Mexico
   City during thirteen-month period. The relationship of composition and
   abundance with soil variables was studied. A total of 101 483 specimens
   belonging to 28 taxa and 191 morphospecies were collected in both sites
   (Open site: Abundance: 60,369, 27 taxa and 181 morphospecies; Closed
   site: 41114, 26 taxa and 179 morphospecies), the value of Shannon's
   diversity index was marginally higher in Closed site (H = 3.67) than in
   Open site (H = 3.59), according to a modified t-test for comparing
   indexes(t(91418) = 9.6946; p < 0.001). Most abundant groups in both
   sites were Cryptostigmata and Prostigmata, with variations during the
   study period. The highest amount of specimens was recovered during the
   rainy season (May-October). The most abundant guilds recorded in both
   sites were predators, fungivores, detritivores and herbivores. The
   composition and trophic guilds of edaphic arthropods in the sites were
   affected by the microhabitat characteristics due to soil
   characteristics. According to a two-way ANOVA test, a significant effect
   due to site (F-1,F-286 = 17.85, p < 0.001) and month (F-12,F-286 =
   22.68, p < 0.001) on the density of edaphic arthropods was recorded, but
   no significant differences in abundance were found when the interaction
   between both variables (F-12,F-286 = 0.77, p > 0.05) was considered. The
   RDA shows that the soil variables explain 23.5\% of the variation
   observed in the distribution of species, and that variationis related
   mainly to the presence of K, P, Na and Mg, and groups of predator
   arthropods are more related to the aforementioned variables, while
   detritivorous groups are more related to MO, N contents, relative
   humidity and pH. The microenvironmental characteristics recorded in both
   sites can explain differences in composition and abundance of soil
   arthropods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Water availability is recognized as one of the most important factors in
   the distribution and activity of terrestrial organisms. In the case of
   insects, hydric stress imposes a major challenge for survival because of
   the small surface-area-to-volume ratio they exhibit. In general, stress
   resistance is expected to co-vary positively with size; however, this
   pattern can become obscured in insects that exhibit sexual size
   dimorphism, as sexes differ in size and/or shape and have dissimilar
   resource allocations. In the present study, we use an allometric-based
   approach to (i) assess the desiccation and starvation stress resistance
   of teneral Anastrepha ludens flies, (ii) disentangle the relationships
   between resistance, size and sex and (iii) examine the adult fly body
   differences in water and lipid contents before and after exposure to
   stress. After controlling for sexual size dimorphism, an allometric
   increase of resistance with overall size was observed for all
   stress-based treatments. The scaling exponents that define the
   proportion of increase resistance varied with size traits and with type
   and degree of hydric stress. In this allometric relationship, and also
   in the relationships between mass and wing length and between size and
   teneral resources, the sexes maintained similar scaling exponents but
   differed in the intercepts. Males were more resistant to stress than
   females; this competitive advantage is probably linked to greater
   amounts of teneral lipids and more water use during stress. (C) 2014

Abstract = {In this work we present the results of relativistic DFT calculations of
   magnetic moments for manganese inserted into a gold ring (Mn@Au-6) or a
   cage-like structure (Mn@Au-12) both pristine and n-thiolated.
   Optimization has been carried out to obtain different isomers always
   favouring the endohedral gold clusters with Mn inside. For the total
   magnetic moment (from electronic population analysis) verification of
   the jellium model has been performed in each case. It is concluded that
   the magnetic moments arise largely from the doped manganese atom and
   that thiolation can modulate its value, which is not present in the pure
   form. In the Mn@Au-12 clusters we observed the formation of a hole in
   their structure; this could be a characteristic of insertion of a highly
   ferromagnetic dopant in some metal clusters, such as gold, and this
   could act as a precursor of the formation of gold magnetic nanotubes.},

Abstract = {The run sum chart is an effective two-sided chart that can be used to
   monitor for process changes. It is known that it is more sensible than
   the Shewhart chart with runs rules and its performance improves as the
   number of regions increases. However, as the number of regions increses
   the resulting chart has more parameters to be defined and its design
   becomes more involved. In this article, we introduce a one-parameter run
   sum chart. This chart accumulates scores equal to the subgroup means and
   signals when the cummulative sum exceeds a limit value. A fast initial
   response feature is proposed and its run length distribution function is
   found by a set of recursive relations. We compare this chart with other
   charts suggested in the literature and find it competitive with the
   CUSUM, the FIR CUSUM, and the combined Shewhart FIR CUSUM schemes.},

Title = {Exploring the Genes of Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis A.
   St.-Hil.) by NGS and De Novo Transcriptome Assembly},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) is an important subtropical
   tree crop cultivated on 326,000 ha in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay,
   with a total yield production of more than 1,000,000 t. Yerba mate
   presents a strong limitation regarding sequence information. The NCBI
   GenBank lacks an EST database of yerba mate and depicts only 80 DNA
   sequences, mostly uncharacterized. In this scenario, in order to
   elucidate the yerba mate gene landscape by means of NGS, we explored and
   discovered a vast collection of I. paraguariensis transcripts. Total RNA
   from I. paraguariensis was sequenced by Illumina HiSeq-2000 obtaining
   72,031,388 pair-end 100 bp sequences. High quality reads were de novo
   assembled into 44,907 transcripts encompassing 40 million bases with an
   estimated coverage of 180X. Multiple sequence analysis allowed us to
   predict that yerba mate contains similar to 32,355 genes and 12,551 gene
   variants or isoforms. We identified and categorized members of more than
   100 metabolic pathways. Overall, we have identified similar to 1,000
   putative transcription factors, genes involved in heat and oxidative
   stress, pathogen response, as well as disease resistance and hormone
   response. We have also identified, based in sequence homology searches,
   novel transcripts related to osmotic, drought, salinity and cold stress,
   senescence and early flowering. We have also pinpointed several members
   of the gene silencing pathway, and characterized the silencing effector
   Argonaute1. We predicted a diverse supply of putative microRNA
   precursors involved in developmental processes. We present here the
   first draft of the transcribed genomes of the yerba mate chloroplast and
   mitochondrion. The putative sequence and predicted structure of the
   caffeine synthase of yerba mate is presented. Moreover, we provide a
   collection of over 10,800 SSR accessible to the scientific community
   interested in yerba mate genetic improvement. This contribution broadly
   expands the limited knowledge of yerba mate genes, and is presented as
   the first genomic resource of this important crop.},

Title = {Complex groundwater flow systems as traveling agent models},
Journal = {PEERJ},

Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {Analyzing field data from pumping tests, we show that as with many other
   natural phenomena, groundwater flow exhibits complex dynamics described
   by 1/f power spectrum. This result is theoretically studied within an
   agent perspective. Using a traveling agent model, we prove that this
   statistical behavior emerges when the medium is complex. Some heuristic
   reasoning is provided to justify both spatial and dynamic complexity, as
   the result of the superposition of an infinite number of stochastic
   processes. Even more, we show that this implies that non-Kolmogorovian
   probability is needed for its study, and provide a set of new partial
   differential equations for groundwater flow.},

Abstract = {We study the effects of primordial magnetic fields on the inflationary
   potential in the context of a warm inflation scenario. The model, based
   on global supersymmetry with a new-inflation-type potential and a
   coupling between the inflaton and a heavy intermediate superfield, is
   already known to preserve the flatness required for slow-roll conditions
   even after including thermal contributions. Here we show that the
   magnetic field makes the potential even flatter, retarding the
   transition and rendering it smoother.},

Abstract = {Biogeographers working under different approaches have proposed several
   terms to refer to biotas, e.g. the flora and fauna of a region, and to
   name subsets of taxa within such biotas. It is not clear whether they
   refer exactly to the same entities and which is the most adequate term
   to refer to them. Ten concepts refer to the set of taxa that inhabit an
   area at a single temporal plane (concrete biota, chronofauna, area of
   endemism, nuclear area, phytocorion, centre of endemism, generalized
   track, biogeographical assemblage, taxonomic assemblage, and species
   assemblage), whereas another nine concepts refer to subsets of taxa
   within a biota (biotic element, historical source, historical component,
   faunal element, cenocron, dispersal pattern, distributional pattern,
   lineage, and historical biota). Three concepts can be ascribed to both
   groups, depending on the author considered (horofauna, chorotype and
   biotic component). I propose to use the terms biota' and cenocron' as
   general terms, within a framework of integrative pluralism. Biotas can
   be considered individuals, for which the terms area of endemism,
   generalized track or chorotype can be preferred for specific analyses.
   Cenocrons incorporate a temporal dimension when implying explicitly or
   implicitly a different time of their incorporation to the biota.},

Title = {Is facilitation a promising strategy for cloud forest restoration?},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {The loss of primary cloud forest within the original range of this
   ecosystem is one of the highest worldwide. Facilitation is a process in
   the plant community dynamics that is potentially useful for the
   restoration of degraded ecosystems. Secondary cloud forest tree species
   possess attributes that make them suitable to be used as facilitator
   species for the establishment of tree species typical of intermediate
   and late successional stages. In this study we examined the facilitator
   potential of two early successional species, Alnus acuminata and Trema
   micrantha, both of which grow rapidly and are capable of gradually
   modifying physical micro-environmental conditions of open sites where
   forest was cleared. The aim was to assess the effects of these two
   species on the survival and growth of two intermediate successional
   species, Juglans pyriformis and Quercus insignis, and one late
   successional species, Oreomunnea mexicana. Open sites were used as
   control. Survivorship of the three target species was significantly
   higher under the canopies of A. acuminata and T. micrantha compared to
   open sites. Almost all annual growth rates (cover, diameter and height)
   were not different in both experiments (under the canopy of A. acuminata
   and T. micrantha), regarding treatment (under canopy vs. open areas) and
   species (target species). However, results for target species survival
   strongly suggest that plantations of early successional species can
   facilitate the establishment of intermediate and late successional
   trees, and thus represent a promising strategy for cloud forest
   restoration. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We present the first report of a virus infecting the subtropical tree
   crop yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil.). Total RNA purification,
   followed by next-generation sequencing, transcripts assembly and
   annotation, resulted in the identification of a new endornavirus species
   infecting yerba mate. The complete sequence of the linear dsRNA viral
   genome is 13,954-nt long, contains a single 13,743 nt ORF, and presents
   a 149 nt 5'UTR and a 61 nt 3'UTR. The predicted ORF encodes a 4,581 aa
   polypeptide with a UDP-glucose glycosyl-transferase, a capsular
   polysaccharide synthesis protein, and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
   domain. The name yerba mate endornavirus is proposed for the identified
   virus. Due to the intriguing peculiarities of this virus family, and the
   complete lack of the yerba mate virus literature, we consider that the
   information reported here will be helpful in leading to a new and needed
   attention to this important topic and crop.},

Abstract = {In this work a non-homogeneous Poisson model is considered to study
   noise exposure. The Poisson process, counting the number of times that a
   sound level surpasses a threshold, is used to estimate the probability
   that a population is exposed to high levels of noise a certain number of
   times in a given time interval. The rate function of the Poisson process
   is assumed to be of a Weibull type. The presented model is applied to
   community noise data from Messina, Sicily (Italy). Four sets of data are
   used to estimate the parameters involved in the model. After the
   estimation and tuning are made, a way of estimating the probability that
   an environmental noise threshold is exceeded a certain number of times
   in a given time interval is presented. This estimation can be very
   useful in the study of noise exposure of a population and also to
   predict, given the current behavior of the data, the probability of
   occurrence of high levels of noise in the near future. One of the most
   important features of the model is that it implicitly takes into account
   different noise sources, which need to be treated separately when using
   usual models. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.},

Title = {Rapid radiation and hybridization contribute to weak differentiation and
   hinder phylogenetic inferences in the New World Mallard complex
   (Anas spp.)},
Journal = {AUK},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {131},

Abstract = {Of the 13 taxa composing the Mallard complex, 4 occur in North America:
   the sexually monochromatic American Black Duck (A. rubripes), Mexican
   Duck (A. {[}platyrhynchos] diazi), and Mottled Duck (A. fulvigula), and
   the dichromatic Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Although morphologically
   distinct, inferring the evolutionary relationships of this group is
   confounded by extensive genic sharing due to incomplete lineage sorting
   and ongoing hybridization. The objective of this study was to examine
   the underlying cause (i.e. incomplete lineage sorting vs. contemporary
   gene flow) of phylogenetic uncertainty. Whereas most taxa were fairly
   structured at mitochondrial DNA, a ``starburst{''} pattern of divergence
   consistent with a rapid radiation was recovered with 17 nuclear introns.
   Furthermore, nuclear-based divergence estimates and tests of population
   structure recovered Florida and West Gulf Coast Mottled Ducks as
   well-differentiated and genetically diagnosable from each other and the
   remaining taxa, whereas Mallards, American Black Ducks, and Mexican
   Ducks were indistinguishable. In general, neither population structure
   analyses nor coalescent-based gene flow estimates conclusively
   identified the presence of hybrids or significant gene flow, suggesting
   that genetic similarity within the group is largely influenced by
   incomplete lineage sorting. However, we also cannot reject potentially
   high levels of gene flow. Moreover, inconsistent relationships among
   species trees indicated that phylogenetic results were sensitive to
   which individuals were included. Taxa within the New World group are
   phenotypically distinguishable, yet genetically similar and seemingly
   lack the apparent reproductive isolation that is consistent with early
   stages of (incomplete) speciation. Future work should focus on genomic
   regions under selection to better understand the stage of speciation
   among the various incipient forms.},

Title = {Combining ecological, social and technical criteria to select species

Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {QuestionHow to evaluate and integrate relevant ecological, social and
   technical criteria to select species to be introduced in restoration
   projects of highly diverse ecosystems such as tropical riparian forests.
   LocationRiparian forest, Marques de Comillas municipality, southeast
   Mexico (16 degrees 54N, 92 degrees 05W).
   MethodsWe proposed a species selection index' (SSI) using five
   independent criteria related to ecological, social and technical
   information. SSI targeted species that (1) are important in the
   reference forest; (2) are less likely to establish following
   disturbance; (3) are not specific to a particular habitat; (4) are
   socially accepted; and (5) their propagation requires a reasonable time
   and financial investment. SSI may range between zero and 50, with higher
   values meaning higher potential for restoration purposes.
   ResultsOut of a local pool of 97 species, we identified 30 target tree
   species that together represented >60\% of total importance value index
   in the reference riparian forests. SSI averaged 28.31.0 over the studied
   species, suggesting that species with high values are not frequent. For
   20 species, reintroduction by means of active forest restoration was
   deemed necessary. Species that established through natural regeneration,
   following secondary regrowth, had lower social value among local
   farmers. Nearly half of the identified species showed technical
   constraints for easy propagation and seeding.
   ConclusionsThe proposed procedure is useful for selecting species to
   initiate forest restoration projects and of other woody ecosystems that
   harbour high biodiversity, and is suitable for several stakeholders
   interested in restoration.},

Abstract = {Development of parallel codes that are both scalable and portable for
   different processor architectures is a challenging task. To overcome
   this limitation we investigate the acceleration of the Elastodynamic
   Finite Integration Technique (EFIT) to model 2-D wave propagation in

   Open Computing Language (OpenCL) and an open-source toolkit called
   PyOpenCL. The implementation is platform independent and can be used on
   AMD or NVIDIA GPUs as well as classical multi-core CPUs. The code is
   based on the Kelvin Voigt mechanical model which has the gain of not
   requiring additional field variables. OpenCL performance can be in
   principle, improved once one can eliminate global memory access latency
   by using local memory. Our main contribution is the implementation of
   local memory and an analysis of performance of the local versus the
   global memory using eight different computing devices (including Kepler,

   Nature of problem:
   Development of parallel codes that are both scalable and portable for
   different processor architectures is a challenging task. To overcome
   this limitation we investigate the acceleration of the Elastodynamic
   Finite Integration Technique (EFIT) to model 2-D wave propagation in
   viscoelastic media by using modern parallel computing devices (PCDs),
   such as multi-core CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics

   Solution method:
   We choose the industry open standard Open Computing Language (OpenCL)

   platform independent and can be used on AMD or NVIDIA GPUs as well as
   classical multi-core CPUs. The code is based on the Kelvin-Voigt

   Restrictions:
   Wave propagation simulation only in 2D Scenarios, OpenCL drivers needed.
   Running time:
   This code can process wave propagation simulations within a few minutes
   in a typical current computer with GPUs or multicore CPUs. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Tantalum-oxide based compounds of the K-2{[}Ln(n-1)Ta(n)O(3n+1)]
   cation-deficient Ruddlesden-Popper series are promising compounds as
   water splitting photocatalysts for hydrogen production. In this work the
   role of the lanthanide (Ln = La, Pr and Nd) in the K(2)LnTa(3)O(10)
   tantalate for the photocatalytic mechanism is studied. The question
   arises as to whether it can be considered only as a ``spectator{''} or
   if it contributes to this mechanism. The band gaps for the
   aforementioned tantalates are studied and here we evaluate how the
   localized Ln:4f states are positioned in the gap. This system is
   analyzed with electronic structure calculations using a linearized
   augmented plane wave method based on Density Functional Theory. It was
   found that two of the lanthanide atoms, Pr and Nd, contribute with 4f
   state in the gap, and these states act as `stepping stones' for the
   electrons to jump to the conduction band. This can be useful in
   designing and tuning future materials for hydrogen production in the
   semiconductor-mediated photocatalytic process of water splitting. (C)

   possibility of role exchange between species, despite firm field
   evidence of such phenomena in nature. In this paper, we build a
   mathematical model capable of reproducing the main phenomenological
   features of role reversal in a classical system and present results for
   both the temporal and spatio-temporal cases. We show that, depending on
   the choice of parameters, our role-reversal dynamical system exhibits
   excitable-like behaviour, generating waves of species' concentrations
   that propagate through space. Our findings fill a long-standing gap in
   modelling ecological interactions and can be applicable to better
   understanding ecological niche shifts and planning of sustainable
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) study of the supramolecular dimer
   formed by a 8-unit oligomer of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the
   fullerene derivative {[}6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester

   potential was used to afford for the long-range van der Waals
   interactions. Our calculations predict two stable isomers in which the
   P3HT 8-mer forms a U-shaped structure surrounding the PCBM. From
   time-dependent DFT calculations it was determined that the maximum
   absorption intensity of the P3HT-PCBM dimer undergoes a blue-shift of
   about 80nm with respect to the isolated P3HT oligomer in qualitative
   agreement with the experimental facts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Effects of Dwarf Mistletoe on Stand Structure of Lodgepole Pine Forests
   21-28 Years Post-Mountain Pine Beetle Epidemic in Central Oregon},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests are widely distributed
   throughout North America and are subject to mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemics, which have caused mortality over
   millions of hectares of mature trees in recent decades. Mountain pine
   beetle is known to influence stand structure, and has the ability to
   impact many forest processes. Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium americanum)
   also influences stand structure and occurs frequently in post-mountain
   pine beetle epidemic lodgepole pine forests. Few studies have
   incorporated both disturbances simultaneously although they co-occur
   frequently on the landscape. The aim of this study is to investigate the
   stand structure of lodgepole pine forests 21-28 years after a mountain
   pine beetle epidemic with varying levels of dwarf mistletoe infection in
   the Deschutes National Forest in central Oregon. We compared stand
   density, stand basal area, canopy volume, proportion of the stand in
   dominant/codominant, intermediate, and suppressed cohorts, average
   height and average diameter of each cohort, across the range of dwarf
   mistletoe ratings to address differences in stand structure. We found
   strong evidence of a decrease in canopy volume, suppressed cohort
   height, and dominant/codominant cohort diameter with increasing
   stand-level dwarf mistletoe rating. There was strong evidence that as
   dwarf mistletoe rating increases, proportion of the stand in the
   dominant/codominant cohort decreases while proportion of the stand in
   the suppressed cohort increases. Structural differences associated with
   variable dwarf mistletoe severity create heterogeneity in this forest
   type and may have a significant influence on stand productivity and the
   resistance and resilience of these stands to future biotic and abiotic
   disturbances. Our findings show that it is imperative to incorporate
   dwarf mistletoe when studying stand productivity and ecosystem recovery
   processes in lodgepole pine forests because of its potential to
   influence stand structure.},

Title = {Non-perturbative study of impurity effects on the Kubo conductivity in

Journal = {PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {449},
Pages = {121-128},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the effects of site and bond impurities on the
   electrical conductance of periodic and quasiperiodic systems with
   macroscopic length by means of a real-space renormalization plus a
   convolution method developed for the Kubo-Greenwood formula. All
   analyzed systems are connected to semi-infinite periodic leads.
   Analytical and numerical conductivity spectra are obtained for one and
   two site impurities in a periodic chain, where the separation between
   impurities determines the number of maximums in the spectra. We also
   found transparent states at the zero chemical potential in Fibonacci
   chains of every three generations with bond impurities, whose existence
   was confirmed by an analytical analysis within the Landauer formalism.
   For many impurities, the spectral average of the conductivity versus the
   system length reveals a power-law behavior, when the distance between
   impurities follows the Fibonacci sequence. Finally, we present an
   analysis of the conductance spectra of segmented periodic and Fibonacci
   chains and nanowires. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce and analyze two structured models for the
   transmission of a vector-borne infectious disease. The first of these
   models assumes that the level of contagiousness and the rate of removal
   (recovery) of infected hosts depends on the infection age. In the second
   model the hosts population is structured with respect to the physical
   age of the hosts, and the susceptibility of the hosts is assumed to be
   age-dependent. For these models, the threshold parameter for the
   existence of a positive (endemic) equilibrium state is determined, and
   the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium states are
   established by the Lyapunov's direct method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {The role of mitochondrial introgression in illuminating the evolutionary
   history of Nearctic treefrogs},

Abstract = {Inferring the evolutionary history of lineages often becomes difficult
   when gene histories are in conflict with each other. Introgression, for
   example, can cause DNA sequences from one species to be more similar to
   sequences of a different species and lead to incongruence amongst gene
   trees. However, incorporating congruent and incongruent locus-specific
   phylogenetic estimates with the geographical distribution of lineages
   may provide valuable insight into evolutionary processes important to
   speciation. In this study, we investigated mitochondrial introgression
   within the Hyla eximia group to better understand its role in
   illuminating the evolutionary history and phylogeography of these
   treefrogs. We reconstructed and compared the matrilineal history of the
   Hyla eximia group with estimates of evolutionary history inferred from
   nuclear genes. We tested for introgression within the mitochondrial and
   nuclear genes using a posterior predictive checking approach.
   Reconstructions of the species tree based on the mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA data were strongly discordant. Introgression
   between lineages was widespread in the mtDNA data set (145 occurrences
   amongst 11 of the 16 lineages), but uncommon in the nuclear genes (12
   occurrences amongst four of the 16 lineages). Nonetheless, the
   geographical structuring of mtDNA within species provides valuable
   information on biogeographical areas, ancient areas of hybridization,
   and unique histories of lineages within the H.eximia group. These
   results suggest that the combination of nuclear, mitochondrial, and
   spatial information can provide a more complete picture of how
   evolutionary history played out', particularly in cases where
   mitochondrial introgression is known to occur.(c) 2014 The Linnean

Abstract = {A 45-day trial was performed to evaluate the effect of biofloc
   technology (BFT) with or without fresh food (FF) supplementation during
   pre-maturation period on Farfantepenaeus duorarum spawning performance,
   biochemical composition and fatty acid profile of eggs as compared with
   conventional clear-water system (CW+FF). Females raised in biofloc and
   that received FF supplementation (FLOC+FF) achieved better spawning
   performance in terms of number of eggs per spawn (49 x 10(3)), number of
   eggs per spawn per g of spawner's body weight (2.1 x 10(3)) and egg size
   (similar to 275 mu m) as compared with CW+FF (23 x 10(3), 1.1 x 10(3)
   and 263 mu m respectively), but both treatments did not vary from FLOC
   (P > 0.05). High spawning activity was also observed in biofloc system
   as compared with clear-water system as shown in number of spawns per
   ablated female (2.2-3.0 versus 0.6) and percentage of females that spawn
   at least once (80-82 versus 25\%). Biochemical composition of eggs
   presented no significant differences among treatments. FA profile of
   eggs indicated that high spawning activity performed by females in
   FLOC+FF treatment was reflected in lower mean levels of EPA, DHA and sum
   of polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3) and (n-6). The better reproductive
   performance demonstrated by females raised in biofloc justified the
   application of this technology in F. duorarum broodstock.},

Abstract = {Hummingbirds are one of the most diverse families of birds and the
   phylogenetic relationships within the group have recently begun to be
   studied with molecular data. Most of these studies have focused on the
   higher level classification within the family, and now it is necessary
   to study the relationships between and within genera using a similar
   approach. Here, we investigated the taxonomic status of the genus
   Hylocharis, a member of the Emeralds complex, whose relationships with
   other genera are unclear; we also investigated the existence of the
   Basilinna genus. We obtained sequences of mitochondrial (ND2: 537 bp)
   and nuclear genes (AK-5 intron: 535 bp, and c-mos: 572 bp) for 6 of the
   8 currently recognized species and outgroups. Our analyses, using 3
   different inference methods (Maximun Parsimony, Likelihood and Bayesian
   methods), corroborate the existence of the hummingbird genus Basilinna
   as composed of 2 species commonly assigned to the genus Hylocharis:
   leucotis and xantusii. Our study also supports that Hylocharis is a
   paraphyletic genus that includes species belonging to the genus

Abstract = {We revise concepts, definitions and examples of biogeographical
   transition zones to help develop a conceptual framework and
   differentiate them from other transitions that occur in the geographical
   space. A biogeographical transition zone is defined as a geographical
   area of overlap, with a gradient of replacement and partial segregation
   between biotic components (sets of taxa that share a similar
   geographical distribution as a product of a common history). It is an
   area where physical features, environmental conditions and ecological
   factors allow the mixture and the co-occurrence of two or more biotic
   components, but also constrain their distribution further into one
   another. The biogeographical affinities of the taxa are the most
   fundamental information to consider to analyse biogeographical
   transition zones accurately. By plotting the frequency of different
   distribution patterns on maps, gradual changes in their relative
   contribution to a given area can be perceived. Thus, the most
   heterogeneous places in terms of distributional patterns can be defined
   numerically on strictly geographical grounds. Biogeographical transition
   zones can occur at every hierarchical level of a biogeographical
   regionalization as long as different biotic components come into contact
   geographically. Ecological boundaries or ecotones when characterized
   only by differences in dominance of some species, life forms or sets of
   characteristic species (not endemic) are not biogeographical transition
   zones as defined herein. (C) 2014 The Linnean Society of London,},

Title = {CLIMATE-DRIVEN DIVERSIFICATION AND PLEISTOCENE REFUGIA IN PHILIPPINE
   BIRDS: EVIDENCE FROM PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE AND PALEOENVIRONMENTAL

Abstract = {Avian diversification in oceanic archipelagos is largely attributed to
   isolation across marine barriers. During glacial maxima, lowered sea
   levels resulted in repeated land connections between islands joined by
   shallow seas. Consequently, such islands are not expected to show
   endemism. However, if climate fluctuations simultaneously caused shifts
   in suitable environmental conditions, limiting populations to refugia,
   then occurrence on and dispersal across periodic land bridges are not
   tenable. To assess the degree to which paleoclimate barriers, rather
   than marine barriers, drove avian diversification in the Philippine
   Archipelago, we produced ecological niche models for current-day,
   glacial maxima, and interglacial climate scenarios to infer potential
   Pleistocene distributions and paleoclimate barriers. We then tested
   marine and paleoclimate barriers for correspondence to geographic
   patterns of population divergence, inferred from DNA sequences from
   eight codistributed bird species. In all species, deep-water channels
   corresponded to zones of genetic differentiation, but six species
   exhibited deeper divergence associated with a periodic land bridge in
   the southern Philippines. Ecological niche models for these species
   identified a common paleoclimate barrier that coincided with deep
   genetic structure among populations. Although dry land connections
   joined southern Philippine islands during low sea level stands,
   unfavorable environmental conditions limited populations within
   landmasses, resulting in long-term isolation and genetic
   differentiation. These results highlight the complex nature of
   diversification in archipelagos: marine barriers, changes in
   connectivity due to sea level change, and climate-induced refugia acted
   in concert to produce great species diversity and endemism in the
   Philippines.},

Title = {Haplotype and Nucleotide Variation in the Exon 3-VNTR of the DRD4

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the population structure of the 48-bp variable
   number of tandem repeats (VNTR), located in exon 3 of the dopamine
   receptor D4 gene (DRD4), in 41 Tarahumara from northern Mexico, 20 Mixe
   from southern Mexico, and 169 people from Mexico City.
   Methods: Genotypes for the DRD4-VNTR were determined, from which 15
   Tarahumara, eight Mixe, and 37 urban homozygous individuals were
   sequenced. Repeat-allele frequencies were compared with other world
   populations.
   Results: The DRD4-VNTR variation in Mexico City appeared similar to the
   world mean. For the Mixe and Maya, DRD4-VNTR diversity appeared closer
   to South American groups whereas the Tarahumara were similar to North
   American groups. People from Mexico City and the Mixe exhibited
   attributes of a large and admixed population and an isolated population,
   respectively. The Tarahumara showed endogamy associated with a
   substructure as suggested by a preliminary regional differentiation. For
   the DRD4-VNTR and/or the adjacent 50-173 bp sequence, the three
   populations exhibited negative Tajima's D. Two new VNTR haplotypes were
   discovered: one in Mexico City and another among the Tarahumara.
   Conclusions: A differentiation in the DRD4-VNTR of global relevance
   occurs between northern and southern populations of Mexico suggesting
   that the Mexican Trans-volcanic Belt has been a major frontier for human
   dispersion in the Americas. Ancient trespass of this barrier appears
   thus related to a major change in the population structure of the
   DRD4-VNTR. Distinctive and independent patterns of DRD4-VNTR diversity
   occur among the two Mexican indigenous populations by a still undefined
   combination of drift and selection. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {In Mexico and particularly in the state of Michoacan, the genesis,
   morphology and function of hydromorphic soils has not been sufficiently
   studied, despite having large areas of continental wetlands such as the

   of the shore of Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan. One was permanently saturated
   with Gleysols development and the other was had periodic flooding and
   fluvisols development in a large floodplain. The results indicate the
   presence of haplic gleysol (colluvic, eutric) (WEB, 2006), dark brown in
   color, with moderate amounts of organic carbon (0.87 \% average), clay>
   30 \%, predominant structure of subangular polyhedra and prisms with
   segregation of sesquioxides ferromanganese protruding from hypo-coatings
   of iron oxides, and the presence of traces of ostracods throughout most
   of the profile. Lithological discontinuity is prominent. The alluvial
   wetlands contain haplic fluvisol (hyperhumic, eutric) (WEB, 2006) with
   soil having a grayish brown matrix, a high content of organic matter
   throughout the profile (> 7 \%), and traces of ostracods. These soils
   have a high base saturation (> 50 \%). Three wet zones are well defined
   within the soil: a lower permanent endosaturation zone, an intermediate
   zone resulting from capillarity and an alternating wetting-drying zone
   in the epipedons.},

Abstract = {Let M-n be a compact oriented hypersurface of a unit sphere Sn+1(1) with
   constant mean curvature H. Given an integer k between 2 and n - 1, we
   introduce a tensor f related to H and to the second fundamental form A
   of M, and show that if vertical bar phi vertical bar(2) <= B-H,B-k and
   tr(phi(3)) <= C-n,C-k vertical bar phi vertical bar(3), where B-H,B-k
   and C-n,C-k are numbers depending only on H, n and k, then either
   vertical bar phi vertical bar(2)  0 or vertical bar phi vertical bar(2) 
   B-H,B-k. We characterize all M-n with vertical bar phi vertical bar(2) 
   B-H,B-k. We also prove that if vertical bar A vertical bar(2) <= 2 root
   k(n - k) and tr(phi(3)) <= C-n,C-k vertical bar f vertical bar(3) then
   vertical bar A vertical bar(2) is constant and characterize all M-n with
   vertical bar A vertical bar(2) in the interval {[}0, 2 root k( n - k)].
   We also study the behavior of vertical bar phi vertical bar(2), with the
   condition additional tr(phi(3)) <= C-n,k vertical bar phi vertical
   bar(3), for complete hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature immersed
   in space forms and show that if sup(M) vertical bar phi vertical bar(2)
   = BH, k and this supremum is attained in M-n then M-n is an
   isoparametric hypersurface with two distinct principal curvatures of
   multiplicities k y n - k.
   Finally, we use rotation hypersurfaces to show that the condition on the
   trace of phi(3) is necessary in our results; more precisely, for each
   integer k with 2 <= k <= n - 1 and H >= 1/root 2n - 1 there is a
   complete hypersurface M-n in Sn+1(1) with constant mean curvature H such
   that sup(M) vertical bar phi vertical bar(2) = B-H,B-k, and this
   supremum is attained in M-n, and which is not a product of spheres.},

Abstract = {Patterns of diversity are scale dependent and beta-diversity is not the
   exception. Mexico is megadiverse due to its high beta diversity, but
   little is known if it is scale-dependent and/or taxonomic-dependent. We
   explored these questions based on the self-similarity hypothesis of
   beta-diversity across spatial scales. Using geographic distribution
   ranges of 2 513 species, we compared the beta-diversity patterns of 4
   groups of terrestrial vertebrates, across 7 spatial scales (from similar
   to 10 km(2) to 160 000 km(2)), within 5 different (historically and
   environmentally) regions in Mexico: Northwest, Northeast, Centre,
   Southeast and the Yucatan Peninsula. We found that beta-diversity: 1)
   was not self-similar along the range of scales, being larger than
   expected according to the null model at coarse scale, and lower, but not
   significantly different, to expected at intermediate and fine scales; 2)
   varied across spatial scales, depending on the taxonomic group and on
   the region; 3) was higher at coarser scales; 4) was highest in the
   Centre and Southeast regions, and lowest in the Yucatan Peninsula, and
   5) was higher for amphibians and reptiles than mammals and birds. As a
   consequence, beta-diversity of each group contributes differentially to
   the megadiversity of Mexico, likely due to a variation in the
   biogeographical histories and the perception of each group to
   environmental heterogeneity. These results show the importance of
   identify the appropriate geographical scale for biodiversity
   conservation analyses, such as for example, the analysis of
   complementarity.},

Abstract = {The patent document is a measurement unit for scientific and
   technological productivity commonly used as a technological indicator.
   Patent studies mainly focus on frequency counts by year, country,
   assignee and inventor. There are scarce studies on the technical
   classifications and contents of the invention. The aim of this paper is
   to propose the use of the International Patent Classification and
   content analysis of some fields of the patent document as a unit of
   measurement and analysis to conduct a study on patent metrics in the
   technological domain vegetable oil combustion. A set of simple and
   relational indicators were used and the software proINTEC analyzed the
   data. The interpretation of the results proves that the information
   contained in patent documents from this domain is relevant for the goals
   of the project in the present case study.},

Abstract = {Mammillaria pectinifera is an endangered cactus endemic to the Tehuacan
   Valley. In the mid-1990s, 6 localities with few individuals were known.
   This information was crucial for protecting the species through national
   and international legal instruments. To enhance the knowledge on its
   geographic distribution and conservation status, exploratory expeditions
   were made: first throughout ecological areas similar to those known with
   existing populations, and later based on a predictive model of
   geographic distribution. Results show that the species is composed by at
   least 31 localities and a much larger number of individuals, and suggest
   the need of stronger emphasis on exploration with the best available
   methods and tools in order to assess the distribution, abundance and
   pressure on a slightly conspicuous species. In spite of the substantial
   increase in localities, and considering the fact that 55\% of them are
   within the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve, the cactus is under
   high anthropogenic pressure, suggesting that the species is vulnerable
   to disappearing in some localities if deterioration rates of its habitat
   are not reduced in the short term.},

Abstract = {The development of agriculture depends on the quantity and quality of
   water available for irrigation, among other factors. Quality varies
   widely according to the quantity and type of salts it contains, since
   some elements such as boron (B) are toxic for plants. In Puebla,
   Tlaxcala and Veracruz over one million hectares are used for irrigation
   agriculture, and therefore it is imperative to know the quality of water
   with respect to boron contents. Therefore, this study conducted an
   investigation to determine the electrical conductivity (EC), pH and B
   content in these waters based on three samplings, performed in 2009,
   2010 and 2011. A total of 91 samples were taken for each sampling. B
   content in water was determined in the hydro-sciences laboratory of the
   Postgraduates College using the Azomethine-H method. Concentrations of B
   in the water were low and less than 1 mg L-1 for 76 of the 91 samples
   collected for each sampling. High contents of B, above 5 mg L-1, were
   found in 15 samples. Of the waters analyzed, 83.5\% is recommended for
   agricultural use without restriction, while 16.5\% is not recommended
   for agricultural, domestic or recreational uses due to the dangers and
   risk of toxicity from B in crops and in humans.},

Title = {Sporogenesis, sporoderm and mature spore ornamentation in Lycopodiaceae},
Journal = {REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1161-1195},

Abstract = {Studies on reproductive aspects, spore morphology and ultrastructure of
   Lycopodiaceae are not very common in the scientific literature, and
   constitute essential information to support taxonomic and systematic
   relationships among the group. In order to complete existing
   information, adding new and broader contributions on these topics, a
   comparative analysis of the sporogenesis ultrastructure, with emphasis
   on cytological aspects of the sporocyte coat development, tapetum,
   monoplastidic and polyplastidic meiosis, sporoderm ontogeny and
   ornamentation of the mature spores, was carried out in 43 taxa of eight
   genera of the Lycopodiaceae: Austrolycopodizun, Diphasium,
   Diphasiastrum, Huperzia (including Phlegmariurus), Lycopodium,
   Lycopodiella, Palhinhaea and Pseudolycopodiella growing in the Andes of
   Colombia and the Neotropics. For this study, the transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) samples were collected in Cauca and Valle del Cauca
   Departments, while most of the spores for scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) analysis were obtained from herbarium samples. We followed
   standard preparation procedures for spore observation by TEM and SEM.
   Results showed that the sporocyte coat is largely composed by primary
   wall components; the sporocyte develop much of their metabolic activity
   in the production of their coat, which is retained until the spores
   release; protective functions for the diploid cells undergoing meiosis
   is postulated here for this layer. The abundance of dictyosomes in the
   sporocyte cytoplasm was related to the formation and development of the
   sporocyte coat. Besides microtubule activity, the membrane of sporocyte
   folds, associated with electrodense material, and would early determine
   the final patterns of spore ornamentation. Monoplastidic condition is
   common in Lycopodium s.l., whereas polyplastidic condition was observed
   in species of Huperzia and Lycopodiella s. l.. In monoplastidic species,
   the tapetum presents abundant multivesicular bodies, while in
   polyplastidic species, the secretory activity of the tapetum is less
   intense. Sporoderm development is centripetal, exospore is the first
   formed layer, then the endospore and, if present, perispore is the final
   deposited layer. Adult spores of the Lycopodiaceae showed two patterns
   of ornamentation: negative or caviform (foveolate spores) and positive
   or muriform ornamentation, the latter with two subtypes (rugate and
   reticulate spores). The spores of Huperzia are characteristically
   foveolate, the rugate spores were found in a few species of Huperzia and
   in all of the Lycopodiella s. l. taxa studied, while Lycopodium s.l.
   spores bear reticulate ornamentation. Numerous ornamentation traits are
   diagnostic at the specific level. The types of ornamentation found do
   not support the recent extreme fragmentation of the family in several
   genera, but could match, a priori, with the idea of three subfamilies.
   The findings of sporogenesis, extremely similar in all taxa studied,
   point more to consider fewer genera, more comprehensive, than the
   recent, marked splitting of the family.},

Abstract = {Mayachernes maatiatus, a new genus and species of pseudoscorpion of the
   family Chernetidae (Arachnida: Pseudoscorpionida), is described from the
   Miocene Chiapas - Amber Lagerstatte, south of Mexico. This new fossil
   species represents an adult male specimen with hard-soft tissues
   preserved in great detail. It differs from all other living chernetids
   by a combination of diagnostic characters. Anatomical data were
   collected using high-resolution microscopy with regular to
   infrared-reflected light. Mayachernes maatiatus is the first newly
   described fossil species of pseudoscorpion from the Chiapas amber. This
   taxon also adds to knowledge of the Chernetidae diversity in the
   southernmost part of North America at the Neogene.},

Title = {Excellence or quality? Impact of the current competition regime on
   science and scientific publishing in Latin America and its implications
   for development},
Journal = {CURRENT SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {The current competition regime that characterizes international science
   is often presented as a quest for excellence. It diversely affects
   research in Latin America and research in the Organization for Economic
   Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. This article asks how
   this competition regime may orient the direction of research in Latin
   America, and to whose advantage. It is argued that, by relating
   excellence to quality differently, a research policy that seeks to
   improve the level of science in Latin America while preserving the
   possibility of solving problems relevant to the region can be designed.
   Competition, it is also argued, certainly has its place in science, but
   not as a general management tool, especially if the goal is to improve
   overall quality of science in Latin America. Scientific competition is
   largely managed through journals and their reputation. Therefore,
   designing a science policy for Latin America (and for any `peripheral'
   region of the world) requires paying special attention to the mechanisms
   underpinning the production, circulation and consumption of scientific
   journals. So-called `international' or `core' journals are of particular
   interest as local, national, or even regional journals must struggle to
   find their place in this peculiar publishing eco-system.},

Title = {Predicting Barrier Beach Breaching due to Extreme Water Levels at San

Abstract = {This study comprises a first approach to numerically determine the
   hydrodynamic conditions leading to barrier breaching at San Quintin,
   located in the northwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula in
   Mexico. The barrier is backed by a large coastal lagoon, fronted by a
   field of submerged volcanoes located several kilometers off the coast
   and is exposed to large incoming wave energy dominated by the Pacific
   swell. The narrowest barrier beach sections are vulnerable to flooding
   due to overwash events that take place during concurrent high spring
   tides, energetic storm waves and a range of storm surge levels. Here,
   the conditions to barrier overwash and breaching occurrence are
   identified, and the extent of the floods is numerically quantified. For
   that purpose, the Delft3D hydrodynamic model is applied coupling waves
   and flows to simulate a series of scenarios, which comprise storm waves
   of different magnitudes and periods approaching from typical directions,
   and coupled to spring tides and several storm surge levels. As a
   consequence of the presence of submerged volcanoes off the coast, the
   incoming wave energy is mostly concentrated at two specific locations
   along the barrier beach, which correspond to the lowest and narrowest
   barrier locations. Due the large distance between both sites, longshore
   variations are not expected to be as strong as the cross-shore.
   Numerical results suggest that the barrier is susceptible to flooding
   during spring tides combined with extreme waves of significant wave
   heights larger than 3.5 m and a peak period of 7.5 s, and storm surge
   levels exceeding 0.9 m, which may lead to breaching.},

Abstract = {The diversity and distribution of mammals in the American tropics remain
   incompletely known. We describe a new species of small-eared shrew
   (Soricidae, Cryptotis) from the Lacandona rain forest, Chiapas, southern
   Mexico. The new species is distinguished from other species of Cryptotis
   on the basis of a unique combination of pelage coloration, size, dental,
   cranial, postcranial, and external characters, and genetic distances. It
   appears most closely related to species in the Cryptotis nigrescens
   species group, which occurs from southern Mexico to montane regions of
   Colombia. This discovery is particularly remarkable because the new
   species is from a low-elevation habitat (approximately 90 m), whereas
   most shrews in the region are restricted to higher elevations, typically
   > 1,000 m. The only known locality for the new shrew is in one of the
   last areas in southern Mexico where relatively undisturbed tropical
   vegetation is still found. The type locality is protected by the Mexican
   government as part of the Yaxchilan Archaeological Site on the border
   between Mexico and Guatemala.},

Title = {Checklist of helminth parasites of Goodeinae (Osteichthyes:
   Cyprinodontiformes: Goodeidae), an endemic subfamily of freshwater
   fishes from Mexico},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {151-191},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {From August 2008 to July 2010, 1,471 fish belonging to the subfamily
   Goodeinae (representing 28 species) were collected from 47 localities
   across central Mexico and analyzed for helminth parasites. In addition,
   a database with all available published accounts of the helminth
   parasite fauna of goodeines was assembled. Based on both sources of
   information, a checklist containing all the records was compiled as a
   necessary first step to address future questions in the areas of
   ecology, evolutionary biology and biogeography of this host-parasite
   association. The checklist is presented in two tables, a parasite-host
   list and a host-parasite list. The checklist contains 51 nominal
   species, from 34 genera and 26 families of helminth parasites. It
   includes 8 species of adult digeneans, 9 metacercarie, 6 monogeneans, 3
   adult cestodes, 9 metacestodes, 1 adult acanthocephalan, 1 cystacanth, 6
   adult nematodes and 8 larval nematodes. Based on the amount of
   information contained in the checklist, we pose that goodeines, a
   subfamily of viviparous freshwater fishes endemic to central Mexico,
   might be regarded as the first group of wildlife vertebrate for which a
   complete inventory of their helminth parasite fauna has been completed.},

Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {We perform numerical measurements of the moments of the position of a
   tracer particle in a two-dimensional periodic billiard model (Lorentz
   gas) with infinite corridors. This model is known to exhibit a weak form
   of superdiffusion, in the sense that there is a logarithmic correction
   to the linear growth in time of the mean-squared displacement. We show
   numerically that this expected asymptotic behavior is easily overwhelmed
   by the subleading linear growth throughout the time range accessible to
   numerical simulations. We compare our simulations to analytical results
   for the variance of the anomalously rescaled limiting normal
   distributions.},

Abstract = {Vector-borne diseases are one of the major public health problems in the
   world with the fastest spreading rate. Control measures have been
   focused on vector control, with poor results in most cases. Vaccines
   should help to reduce the diseases incidence, but vaccination strategies
   should also be defined. In this work, we propose a vector-transmitted
   SIR disease model with age-structured population subject to a
   vaccination program. We find an expression for the age-dependent basic
   reproductive number , and we show that the disease-free equilibrium is
   locally stable for , and a unique endemic equilibrium exists for . We
   apply the theoretical results to public data to evaluate vaccination
   strategies, immunization levels, and optimal age of vaccination for

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Nine aromatic compounds (caffeic acid, syringaldehyde, vanillic acid,
   guaiacol, vanillin, sinapic acid, syringol, syringic acid and ferulic
   acid) and four metallic compounds (CuSO4, AgNO3, MnSO4, and CaCl2) were
   tested for their ability to increase laccase (Lac) activity in the
   ligninolytic basidiomycete Phlebia brevispora BAFC 633. The addition of
   syringaldehyde, syringol, guaiacol, sinapic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid
   and CuSO4 showed a positive effect on fungal growth; however, it
   decreased dramatically with the addition of AgNO3 and did not undergo
   changes in the presence of CaCl2 or MnSO4. Lac activity increased with
   the addition of all the compounds tested, depending on the concentration
   and the day of culture. P. brevispora BAFC 633 produced two isoenzymes,
   a constitutively expressed of 60 kDa and another of 75 kDa expressed
   upon induction by sinapic acid, MnSO4 or CuSO4. Lac secretion capacity
   of P. brevispora BAFC 633 can be increased 27 times higher than the
   control with the highest levels detected in the presence of 0.3 mM CuSO4
   at day 14. The action is affected at pre-transcriptional level
   regulating at the onset of the process, however it does not rule out the
   effect at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels, for
   which is necessary to deepen in the knowledge of all possible regulation
   points of gene expression.},

Title = {Artificial Neural Networks applied to estimate permeability, porosity
   and intrinsic attenuation using seismic attributes and well-log data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {107},
Pages = {45-54},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Permeability and porosity are two fundamental reservoir properties which
   relate to the amount of fluid contained in a reservoir and its ability
   to flow. The intrinsic attenuation is another important parameter since
   it is related to porosity, permeability, oil and gas saturation and
   these parameters significantly affect the seismic signature of a
   reservoir. We apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict
   permeability (k) and porosity (phi) for a carbonate aquifer in
   southeastern Florida and to predict intrinsic attenuation (1/Q) for a
   sand-shale oil reservoir in northeast Texas. In this study, the Gamma
   test (a revolutionary estimator of the noise in a data set) has been
   used as a mathematically non-parametric nonlinear smooth modeling tool
   to choose the best input combination of seismic attributes to estimate k
   and phi, and the best combination of well-logs to estimate 1/Q This
   saves time during the construction and training of ANN models and also
   sets a lower bound for the mean squared error to prevent over-training.
   The Neural Network method successfully delineates a highly permeable
   zone that corresponds to a high water production in the aquifer. The
   Gamma test found nonlinear relations that were not visible to linear
   regression allowing us to generalize the ANN estimations of k, phi and
   1/Q for their respective sets of patterns that were not used during the
   learning phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Functional and Phylogenetic Comparison of Quorum Sensing Related Genes
   in Brucella melitensis 16M},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {A quorum-sensing (QS) system is involved in Brucella melitensis survival
   inside the host cell. Two transcriptional regulators identified in B.
   melitensis, BlxR and VjbR, regulate the expression of virB, an operon
   required for bacterial intracellular persistence. In this work, 628
   genes affected by VjbR and 124 by BlxR were analyzed to gain insights
   into their functional and taxonomical distributions among the Bacteria
   and Archaea cellular domains. In this regard, the Cluster of Orthologous
   Groups (COG) genes and orthologous genes in 789 nonredundant bacterial
   and archaeal genomes were obtained and compared against a group of
   randomly selected genes. From these analyses, we found 71 coaffected
   genes between VjbR and BlxR. In the COG comparison, VjbR activated genes
   associated with intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular
   transport and defense mechanisms, while BlxR affected genes related to
   energy production and conversion (with an equal effect) and translation,
   ribosomal structure and biogenesis, posttranslational modifications and
   carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (with a negative effect). When
   the taxonomical distribution of orthologous genes was evaluated, the
   VjbR- and BlxR-related genes presented more orthologous genes in
   Crenarchaeota (Archaea), Firmicutes, and Tenericutes and fewer genes in
   Proteobacteria than expected by chance. These findings suggest that QS
   system exert a fine-tuning modulation of gene expression, by which VjbR
   activates genes related to infection persistence and defense, while BlxR
   represses general bacterial metabolism for intracellular adaptations.
   Finally, these affected genes present a degree of presence among
   Bacteria and Archaea genomes that is different from that expected by
   chance.},

Abstract = {The annual histological changes in ovarian morphology (oogenesis,
   follicular atresia, and corpus luteum) are described for the Mexican
   lizard Sceloporus grammicus, in two populations that inhabit contrasting
   environments (vegetation categories, climate, precipitation, and
   temperature) from Hidalgo State, Mexico. Two germinal beds were situated
   on the dorsal surface of each ovary of this species. In both the
   populations, oogenesis involves two major processes: previtellogenesis
   and vitellogenesis. The histological changes during previtellogenesis
   are similar to those for other reptilian sauropsids, whereas
   vitellogenesis differs and the features of this last process are
   described for the first time. In early previtellogenesis, primary
   oocytes have fibrillar chromosomes and the ooplasm stains slightly. The
   primordial follicles are surrounded by a granulosa composed of cuboidal
   follicular cells. During late previtellogenesis, the oocyte had an
   eccentric nucleus with lamp-brush chromosomes and multiple nucleoli. The
   granulosa becomes multilayered and polymorphic, containing three cell
   types: small, intermediate, and pyriform. The zona pellucida was
   homogeneous and clearly observed. In early vitellogenesis, the oocyte
   showed several small acidophilic granules distributed in the center and
   the periphery of the oocyte. As vitellogenesis progresses, the yolk
   platelets move toward the central area of the oocyte and they fuse to
   form acidophilic and homogeneous yolk. Lipid droplets were distributed
   irregularly in the ooplasm of the oocyte. In Zacualtipan, the results
   revealed a strong seasonal reproductive activity. Females had
   vitellogenic follicles from July to September, and pregnant females were
   founded from September to March. In Tizayuca, the results showed an
   unusual pattern of reproductive activity. Females with vitellogenic
   follicles and pregnant females were found throughout the year,
   indicating continuous reproduction. We suggest that the observed
   differences in reproductive activity from these populations indicate
   adaptative fine tuning in response to local environmental conditions.
   These results contribute to the knowledge of variation in vitellogenesis
   and reproductive strategies of this species and among spiny lizards
   overall. J. Morphol. 275: 949-960, 2014. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {The use of molecules and reactions as evidence, markers and/or traits
   for evolutionary processes has a history more than a century long.
   Molecules have been used in studies of intra-specific variation and
   studies of similarity among species that do not necessarily result in
   the analysis of phylogenetic relations. Promoters of the use of
   molecular data have sustained the need for quantification as the main
   argument to make use of them. Moreover, quantification has allowed
   intensive statistical analysis, as a condition and a product of
   increasing automation. All of these analyses are subject to the
   methodological anxiety characteristic of a community in search of
   objectivity (Suarez-Diaz and Anaya-Muoz, Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed
   Sci 39:451-458, 2008). It is in this context that scientists compared
   and evaluated protein and nucleic acid sequence data with other types of
   molecular data - including immunological, electrophoretic and
   hybridization data. This paper argues that by looking at long-term
   historical processes, such as the use of molecular evidence in
   evolutionary biology, we gain valuable insights into the history of
   science. In that sense, it accompanies a growing concern among
   historians for big-pictures of science that incorporate the fruitful
   historical research on local cases of the last decades.},

Title = {Potential impact of harvesting on the population dynamics of two
   epiphytic bromeliads},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {52-61},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large numbers of epiphytes are extracted from cloud forests for
   ornamental use and illegal trade in Latin America. We examined the
   potential effects of different harvesting regimes on the population
   dynamics of the epiphytic bromeliads Tillandsia multicaulis and
   Tillandsia punctulata. The population dynamics of these species were
   studied over a 2-year period in a tropical montane cloud forest in
   Veracruz, Mexico. Prospective and retrospective analyses were used to
   identify which demographic processes and life-cycle stages make the
   largest relative contribution to variation in population growth rate
   (lambda). The effect of simulated harvesting levels on population growth
   rates was analysed for both species. lambda of both populations was
   highly influenced by survival (stasis), to a lesser extent by growth,
   and only slightly by fecundity. Vegetative growth played a central role
   in the population dynamics of these organisms. The lambda value of the
   studied populations did not differ significantly from unity: T.
   multicaulis lambda (95\% confidence interval) = 0.982 (0.897-1.060) and
   T. punctulata lambda = 0.967 (0.815-1.051), suggesting population
   stability. However, numerical simulation of different levels of
   extraction showed that lambda would drop substantially even under very
   low (2\%) harvesting levels. Matrix analysis revealed that T.
   multicaulis and T. punctulata populations are likely to decline and
   therefore commercial harvesting would be unsustainable. Based on these
   findings, management recommendations are outlined. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {The initial contact of European populations with indigenous populations
   of the Americas produced diverse admixture processes across North,
   Central, and South America. Recent studies have examined the genetic
   structure of indigenous populations of Latin America and the Caribbean
   and their admixed descendants, reporting on the genomic impact of the
   history of admixture with colonizing populations of European and African
   ancestry. However, relatively little genomic research has been conducted
   on admixture in indigenous North American populations. In this study, we
   analyze genomic data at 475,109 single-nucleotide polymorphisms sampled
   in indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest in British Columbia and
   Southeast Alaska, populations with a well-documented history of contact
   with European and Asian traders, fishermen, and contract laborers. We
   find that the indigenous populations of the Pacific Northwest have
   higher gene diversity than Latin American indigenous populations. Among
   the Pacific Northwest populations, interior groups provide more evidence
   for East Asian admixture, whereas coastal groups have higher levels of
   European admixture. In contrast with many Latin American indigenous
   populations, the variance of admixture is high in each of the Pacific
   Northwest indigenous populations, as expected for recent and ongoing
   admixture processes. The results reveal some similarities but notable
   differences between admixture patterns in the Pacific Northwest and
   those in Latin America, contributing to a more detailed understanding of
   the genomic consequences of European colonization events throughout the
   Americas.},

Title = {Final Opportunity to Rehabilitate an Urban River as a Water Source for
   Mexico City},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount and quality of water in
   the Magdalena-Eslava river system and to propose alternatives for
   sustainable water use. The system is the last urban river in the
   vicinity of Mexico City that supplies surface water to the urban area.
   Historical flow data were analyzed (1973-2010), along with the
   physicochemical and bacteriological attributes, documenting the
   evolution of these variables over the course of five years (2008-2012)
   in both dry and rainy seasons. The analyses show that the flow regime
   has been significantly altered. The physicochemical variables show
   significant differences between the natural area, where the river
   originates, and the urban area, where the river receives untreated
   wastewater. Nutrient and conductivity concentrations in the river were
   equivalent to domestic wastewater. Fecal pollution indicators and
   various pathogens were present in elevated densities, demonstrating a
   threat to the population living near the river. Estimates of the value
   of the water lost as a result of mixing clean and contaminated water are
   presented. This urban river should be rehabilitated as a sustainability
   practice, and if possible, these efforts should be replicated in other
   areas. Because of the public health issues and in view of the population
   exposure where the river flows through the city, the river should be
   improved aesthetically and should be treated to allow its ecosystem
   services to recover. This river represents an iconic case for Mexico
   City because it connects the natural and urban areas in a
   socio-ecological system that can potentially provide clean water for
   human consumption. Contaminated water could be treated and reused for
   irrigation in one of the green areas of the city. Wastewater treatment
   plants and the operation of the existing purification plants are urgent
   priorities that could lead to better, more sustainable water use
   practices in Mexico City.},

Title = {Chemical composition, potential toxicity, and quality control.
   procedures of the crude drug of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {154},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cyrtopodium macrobulbon
   ({''}canaveral{''}) has been long used in Mexican traditional medicine
   for the treatment of painful urinary ailments ({''}mal de orin{''}) in
   men. This study was conducted (i) to establish the potential acute
   toxicity and the antinociceptive activity of some preparations of
   Cyrtopodium macrobulbon, in order to demonstrate its preclinical
   efficacy for treating symptoms of ``mal de orin{''}; and (ii) to
   determine the chemical composition and quality control parameters of
   this medicinal orchid.
   Materials and methods: The antinociceptive effect was assessed using the
   acetic acid-induced writhing and the hot-plate tests. Investigation of
   the acute toxicity was accomplished by the Lorke method. The organic
   extract (OE) was subjected to conventional phytochemical study using
   chromatographic conventional procedures. The volatile components profile
   of the species was accomplished via GC-MS analysis of HS-SPME-adsorbed
   compounds. Furthermore, an HPLC method to quantify ephemeranthol B (10)
   was developed and validated according to the International Conference on
   Harmonization Guidelines. Microscopic anatomy studies were performed
   using light and scanning electron microscopies. Finally, a potential
   distribution map was generated using the MaxEnt modeling method.
   Results: AE and OE were not toxic to mice since the LD50 was higher than
   5000 mg/kg. OE was only active in the acetic acid-induced writhing assay
   at the doses of 100 and 316 mg/kg. Conventional phytochemical analysis
   of OE led to the isolation and characterization of
   n-hexacosyl-trans-p-coumarate (1), n-octacosyl-trans-p-coumarate (2),
   n-triacontyl-trans-p-coumarate (3), 4-methoxy-benzyl alcohol (4),
   4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5),
   1,5,7-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2,6-diol (6), confusarin (7),
   gigantol (8), batatasin III (9), and ephemeranthol B (10). The major
   volatile components identified by HS-SPME analysis were
   6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, eucalyptol (11), and isobornyl
   formate. An HPLC analytical method for the quantification of compound 10
   in the plant was developed and fully validated for selectivity,
   accuracy, and precision. The microscopic studies revealed that the
   epidermal tissue displayed a layer of enlarged, crenate and cell
   thin-walled cells with a thickened cuticle; these cells are described
   for first time for this species. The potential distribution map
   generated revealed that this species is widespread in Mexico from
   Sinaloa to Merida states.
   Conclusions: The results of the pharmacological studies tend to support
   the traditional use of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon for ``mal de orin{''};
   the presence of compounds 8, 9, and 11 with known antinociceptive
   activity might be related with the pharmacological effect demonstrated.
   The HPLC and microscopic analyses developed in this work will be
   valuable tools for quality control purposes for this plant. (C) 2014

Abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of larval morphology in the
   Neotropical toad genus Melanophryniscus. The taxa studied included 23
   species with representatives of recognized phenetic groups and different
   larval ecomorphological guilds: pond, stream, and phytotelm-dwelling
   tadpoles. Their external morphology variation is congruent with current
   phenetic arrangement based on adult features, but also reflects the
   habitat where larvae develop. Lotic tadpoles (i.e. M.tumifrons group and
   M.krauczuki) in general exhibit a more depressed body, a longer tail
   with lower fins, and larger oral discs than lentic forms (i.e.
   M.stelzneri group, M.moreirae, M.sanmartini, and M.langonei). Despite
   their peculiar, confined microhabitat, phytotelm larvae do not diverge
   markedly from non-arboreal species. The distinctive features of all
   species are the presence of a pineal end organ and the placement of the
   intestinal reversal point at the left of the abdomen in typical larval
   stages. The buccal cavity and musculoskeletal anatomy are quite
   conserved between species, yet some characteristics differ from those of
   other bufonids. The presence of one pair of subhyoid muscles is
   apparently an exclusive trait of Melanophryniscus among Bufonidae.(c)

Title = {Effects of seed burial on germination, protein mobilisation and seedling

Abstract = {Ecological restoration of disturbed areas requires substantial knowledge
   of the germination of native plants and the creation of novel methods to
   increase seedling establishment in the field. We studied the effects of
   soil matrix priming on the germination of Dodonaea viscosa seeds, which
   exhibit physical dormancy. To this end, we buried both pre-scarified (in
   H2SO4, 3 min) and non-pre-scarified seeds in the Parque Ecologico de la
   Ciudad de Mexico. After seeds were unearthed, they were post-scarified
   for 0, 2, 6 and 10 min and their germination percentages compared to the
   germination of a control batch of laboratory-stored seeds. For both
   control and unearthed seeds, the protein pattern was determined in the
   enriched storage protein fraction in SDS-PAGE gels stained with
   Coomassie blue. Percentage germination increased as the scarification
   time increased. Pre-scarification significantly increased percentage
   germination of post-scarified seeds in relation to the control and
   non-pre-scarified seeds. In seeds unearthed from the forest site, the
   buried pre-scarified seeds had relatively high percentage germination,
   even in the absence of post-scarification treatment. A 48-kDa protein
   was not found in unearthed, pre-scarified seeds nor in the control
   germinated seeds, indicating that mobilisation of this protein occurred
   during soil priming. Burying seeds for a short period, including the
   beginning of the rainy season, promoted natural priming, which increased
   protein mobilisation. Functionally, priming effects were reflected in
   high percentage seedling survival in both the shade house and the field.
   Seed burial also reduced the requirement for acidic post-scarification.},

Abstract = {In this work we employ a recently devised metric within the
   Geometrothermodynamics program to study ordinary thermodynamic systems.
   The new feature of this metric is that, in addition to Legendre
   symmetry, it exhibits invariance under a change of representation. This
   metric was derived in a previous work by the authors while addressing
   the problem of the conformal structure of the thermodynamic metrics for
   different representations. Here, we present a thorough analysis for the
   ideal gas, the van der Waals fluid, the one dimensional Ising model and
   some other systems of cosmological interest. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Parasites are agents of disease in humans, livestock, crops, and

   professional opportunities and global public need, we gathered at the
   Cedar Point Biological Station of the University of Nebraska in
   September 2012 to formulate a cooperative and broad platform for
   providing essential information about the evolution, ecology, and
   epidemiology of parasites across host groups, parasite groups,
   geographical regions, and ecosystem types. A general protocol,
   documentation assessment monitoring action (DAMA), suggests an
   integrated proposal to build a proactive capacity to understand,
   anticipate, and respond to the outcomes of accelerating environmental
   change. We seek to catalyze discussion and mobilize action within the
   parasitological community and, more widely, among zoologists and disease
   ecologists at a time of expanding environmental perturbation.},

Abstract = {We studied the effects of landscape structure on species with resource
   nutritional partition between the immature and adult stages by
   investigating how food quality and spatial structure of a landscape may
   affect the invasion and colonization of the insect pest, Diabrotica
   speciosa. To this end, we formulated two bidimensional stochastic
   cellular automata, one for the insect immature stage and the other for
   the adult stage. The automata are coupled by adult oviposition and
   emergence. Further, each automata site has a specific culture type,
   which can affect differently the fitness attributes of immatures and
   adults, such as mortality, development and oviposition rates. We derived
   the mean-field approximation for these automata model, from which we
   obtained conditions for insect invasion. We ran numerical simulations
   using entomological parameters obtained from laboratory experiments
   (using bean, soybean, potato, and corn crops), and we compared the
   results of the automata with the ones given by the mean-field
   approximation. Finally, using artificially generated landscapes, we
   discussed how the structured heterogeneous landscape can affect
   dispersal and establishment of insect populations.},

Abstract = {The Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOc) is located in the boundary between
   the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, area which has been considered as
   a complex transition zone. We analysed biogeographic patterns of its
   resident avifauna, including species richness, endemism, and biotic
   regionalization by analysing presence-absence matrices of 148 species of
   resident-terrestrial birds. We created the species richness maps by
   overlapping potential distribution maps obtained for each species via
   species distribution models (SDMs). To depict biogeographic patterns, we
   used strict consensus cladograms from parsimony analyses of endemicity
   (PAE) and phenograms from an unweighted pair-group method with
   arithmetic average clustering algorithm. The Pacific slope of the SMOc
   contains the highest species richness, decreasing towards the northeast,
   and reflected in endemic and endangered species richness patterns. The
   PAE resulted in one area of endemism represented by the whole SMOc,
   outlining a divided area in its Pacific slope. The cluster analyses
   divided the area into two. One group towards the Pacific slope,
   delimited by the mountain ridge and characterized by tropical vegetation
   types and Mexican-Mesoamerican affinities; the other group is located
   towards the east and northeast, characterized by arid and temperate
   types of vegetation and Nearctic affinities. These results evidence a
   transition from a tropical to a temperate composition of bird species.
   In this way the location for a boundary between the Nearctic and the
   transition zone, for birds in this part of Mexico, is restricted to
   these highest elevations.},

Abstract = {A predator-prey model was applied to the red grouper Epinephelus morio
   fishery from Yucatan, Mexico, with the aim of understanding the spatial
   behaviour of a mid-sized fishing fleet. The heterogeneity of the
   environment was considered, and different habitat quality levels were
   determined to address environmental differences. The behaviour of the
   fleet was also evaluated based on a simulation of restricted fishing
   areas (RFA). The model was applied utilising 5 years of information on
   catch and fishing effort (1973-1977). Four levels of habitat quality
   were defined (low, medium, high and exceptional). The total costs and
   revenue for a fishing expedition in the areas of exceptional habitat
   quality were higher due to their location farthest from the base port.
   The fleet was most efficient during the winter at locations in the
   eastern continental shelf, with the number of these areas clearly
   decreasing in the autumn. The model simulation of the RFA showed a total
   revenue reduction of 7-27 \% in scenarios of RFA for adult protection.
   When the RFA was implemented for the protection of juvenile fish, the
   total revenue was not reduced, indicating that this type of RFA might be
   a feasible management strategy for a sustainable fishery.},

Abstract = {Human disturbance has disrupted the dynamics of plant communities. To
   restore these dynamics, we could take advantage of the microclimatic
   conditions generated by remaining patches of vegetation and plastic
   mulch. These microclimatic conditions might have great importance in
   restoring disturbed lava fields located south of Mexico City, where the
   rock is exposed and the soil is shallow. We evaluated the effects of
   both the shade projected by vegetation patches and plastic mulch on the
   mean monthly soil surface temperature (T (ss)) and photosynthetic photon
   flux density (PPFD) and on the survival and growth of Salvia mexicana
   throughout the year. This species was used as a phytometer of microsite
   quality. Shade reduced the T (ss) to a greater extent than mulch did.
   Both survival and growth were enhanced by shade and mulch, and the PPFD
   was related with seedling growth. During the dry season, plant biomass
   was lost, and there was a negative effect of PPFD on plant growth. At
   micro-meteorological scales, the use of shade projected by patches of
   vegetation and mulch significantly reduced the mortality of S. mexicana
   and enhanced its growth. Survival and growth of this plant depended on
   the environmental quality of microsites on a small scale, which was
   determined by the environmental heterogeneity of the patches and the
   landscape. For plant restoration, microsite quality must be evaluated on
   small scales, but on a large scale it may be enough to take advantage of
   landscape shade dynamics and the use of mulch to increase plant survival
   and growth.},

Title = {Birds at the urban fringe: avian community shifts in different
   peri-urban ecotones of a megacity},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {619-628},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cities can be regionalized in intra-urban and peri-urban areas. The
   space between urban areas and adjacent systems represents an ecological
   transition that often acts as a semi-permeable biological filter. In
   this study, we assessed changes in avian community species richness,
   density, and composition at different peri-urban ecotones (i.e.,
   urban-croplands, urban-grasslands, urban-shrublands) of northeastern
   Mexico City. Species richness was lower in the urban component of
   urban-grassland and urban-shrubland ecotones, while bird densities were
   higher in the urban components of the urban-grassland and
   urban-shrubland peri-urban ecotones, mainly due to the high number of
   urban exploiter species. However, the urban-cropland peri-urban ecotone
   exhibited a different pattern, with similar low bird species richness
   and density values between both components (urban and non-urban). A
   species composition analysis revealed that urban bird communities were
   not influenced by adjacent non-urban habitats, since the urban
   components of peri-urban ecotones were more similar among them than in
   relation to the rest of non-urban components. In summary, results of
   this study show that urbanization can represent an important biological
   filter for birds, often reducing species richness and homogenizing avian
   communities at local scales. As the environmental variables determining
   ecological processes related to the semi-permeable filter effect that
   urban areas pose to biodiversity might depend on urban habitats,
   regions, and spatial scales, further studies are needed to fully
   understand this phenomenon.},

Title = {NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR SHORT GAMMA-RAY BURST PRODUCTION IN BINARY
   NEUTRON STAR MERGERS},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {788},

Abstract = {The central engine of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) is hidden from
   direct view, operating at a scale much smaller than that probed by the
   emitted radiation. Thus we must infer its origin not only with respect
   to the formation of the trigger-the actual astrophysical configuration
   that is capable of powering an sGRB-but also from the consequences that
   follow from the various evolutionary pathways that may be involved in
   producing it. Considering binary neutron star mergers we critically
   evaluate, analytically and through numerical simulations, whether the
   neutrino-driven wind produced by the newly formed hyper-massive neutron
   star can allow the collimated relativistic outflow that follows its
   collapse to actually produce an sGRB or not. Upon comparison with the
   observed sGRB duration distribution, we find that collapse cannot be
   significantly delayed (<= 100 ms) before the outflow is choked, thus
   limiting the possibility that long-lived hyper-massive remnants can
   account for these events. In the case of successful breakthrough of the
   jet through the neutrino-driven wind, the energy stored in the cocoon
   could contribute to the precursor and extended emission observed in
   sGRBs.},

Title = {Conserving Tropical Tree Diversity and Forest Structure: The Value of
   Small Rainforest Patches in Moderately-Managed Landscapes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Rainforests are undergoing severe deforestation and fragmentation
   worldwide. A huge amount of small forest patches are being created, but
   their value in conserving biodiversity and forest structure is still
   controversial. Here, we demonstrate that in a species-rich and
   moderately-managed Mexican tropical landscape small rainforest patches
   (<100 ha) can be highly valuable for the conservation of tree diversity
   and forest structure. These patches showed diverse communities of native
   plants, including endangered species, and a new record for the country.
   Although the number of logged trees increased in smaller patches, patch
   size was a poor indicator of basal area, stem density, number of
   species, genera and families, and community evenness. Cumulative
   species-area curves indicated that all patches had a similar
   contribution to the regional species diversity. This idea also was
   supported by the fact that patches strongly differed in floristic
   composition (high beta-diversity), independently of patch size. Thus, in
   agreement with the land-sharing approach, our findings support that
   small forest patches in moderately-managed landscapes should be included
   in conservation initiatives to maintain landscape heterogeneity, species
   diversity, and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {As part of an ongoing inventory of the helminth parasites of freshwater
   fishes in Mexico, 570 individual fish were collected between Apr 2008
   and Oct 2011 in 26 localities along the Cuatro Cienegas region in
   Coahuila State, northern Mexico. Seventeen species of hosts, mostly
   corresponding to Nearctic freshwater elements, were studied. A total of
   8324 individual worms were collected during this survey, representing 25
   species of helminths, of which 9 were digeneans, 3 monogeneans, 3
   acanthocephalans, 9 nematodes and 1 cestode. Most of the records in this
   checklist represent new host or locality records. The information
   provided in this checklist may be helpful for our understanding of the
   biodiversity and historical biogeography of this host-parasite system,
   because in the Cuatro Cienegas region occur a Nearctic freshwater fish
   fauna, along with Neotropical and endemic elements, and from a
   biogeographical point of view, this may represent a transitional area.},

Abstract = {The Rhinella veraguensis group is likely a paraphyletic assemblage that
   contains 16 species of Andean toads. To date, descriptions are available
   for larval stages of only three species, all of which possess a distinct
   sucker in the abdominal region. In this study, we describe the tadpoles
   of Rhinella rumbolli, a medium-sized Salta Toad typical of forest
   streams in northwestern Argentina. Thirty-three larvae (Gosner Stages
   32-36) were processed for studies of the external morphology, buccal
   cavity, and musculoskeletal system. These larvae show a mosaic of
   features, some typical of the genus and some others unique to the R.
   veraguensis group. Several character states are specific to R. rumbolli,
   namely the lack of an abdominal sucker, 2-4 lingual papillae, and the
   absence of adrostral cartilages. Some traits are frequent in other
   stream tadpoles such as the muscular tail, large oral disc with complete
   labial rows, and the wide and robust anterior neurocranium. Bufonid
   tadpoles exhibit an extraordinary variation in ecology, such as
   preferred microhabitat, and the diversity within the family is
   exemplified within the genus Rhinella. Further comparative morphological
   and developmental studies, framed in the context of phylogenetic
   hypotheses, are needed in order to explore the pattern variation in
   different clades and to discuss character evolution and form-function
   relationships.},

   (August 2006 to August 2007). The lowest survival percentages were
   recorded for A. religiosa and P. hartwegii in the treatment without
   vegetation. The highest survival values for Q. rugosa corresponded to
   plants inoculated with mycorrhizae. Moreover, the inoculated Q. rugosa
   seedlings reached the highest height values when compared to those
   without mycorrhizae. The treatments proved to be successful for the
   three tree species; therefore, we recommend them for a reforestation

Title = {GERMINATION OF STORED SEEDS OF FOUR TREE SPECIES FROM THE TROPICAL DRY

Abstract = {Studies on propagation of trees of Tropical Dry Forests are scarce in
   Mexico; besides, the provenance of seeds used in reforestation programs
   is generally unknown or poorly addressed. Knowledge on seed germination
   patterns of different provenances, and how they change through time, is
   useful to identify adequate sources of seeds and to develop seed
   collection and storage programs under low-tech conditions prevailing in
   most rural nurseries. We evaluated seed size variation and germination
   of stored seeds from three different provenances per species in Acacia
   bilimekii, Haematoxylum brasiletto, Lysiloma acapulcense, and L.
   divaricatum. Seeds were collected in four sites in the Tropical Dry
   Forest of Morelos, Mexico, and were stored at room temperature; seed
   size was estimated through the volume of 75 seeds per
   provenance/species. Seed germination tests were made periodically from
   six to 24 months after storage and the effects of provenance and storage
   time on germination were analyzed using analysis of variance. There were
   significant differences in seed size among provenances in all species,
   while the effect of provenance on germination was significant in three
   of them. Germination changed with storage time among species and
   provenances. After 24 months, germination capacity was still >= 50\% in
   all provenances of the two Lysiloma species, but in A. bilimekii there
   were large differences among provenances. Mean germination capacity was
   low in H. brasiletto after six months. More research on seed germination
   and storage of a larger set of species and provenances is needed to
   restore Mexican tropical dry forests.},

Abstract = {We describe the altitudinal variation in species richness, turnover and
   species composition of small mammals through field surveys along 4
   transects ranging from tropical rainforests at 500 m to high Andean
   deserts at 4 000 m in northwestern Argentina. The elevation pattern of
   richness for all small mammals decreases with altitude, mainly due to
   the high diversity of bats in the lowlands. For the terrestrial small
   mammals there was a clear curvilinear pattern of richness with a peak
   near the upper tree line at 2 700 m. The maximum values of the species
   turnover rates were located in the upper part of the gradient at 3 500
   m. The composition of small mammals communities in every single
   elevation transect was consistent with the phytogeographic scheme, with
   species characteristics of montane rainforest, temperate cloud forests
   and high Andean steppes. The analysis of the 4 altitudinal transects
   together revealed that elevation is the. main source of variation in
   species composition. Latitudinally, the 2 northernmost transects,
   similar between each other, differed from the 2 southernmost, mainly at
   intermediate elevation, where a high concentration of endemic rodents
   has been documented.},

Abstract = {The community structure of the class Gastropoda in the reef lagoon of
   Isla Verde, Veracruz, was analyzed in 3 seasons: windy, dry and rainy.
   The community analysis of gastropods was based on 4 field trips
   conducted in October 2009, April, August and December 2010. The highest
   value of Shannon index was 2.422 bit/ind, the most abundant, 472
   specimens, bottom was dead coral and the richest, 27 species, season was
   rainy season of 2010. The total number of records for this location was
   111 species of gastropods. With the samplings carried out, the species
   richness increased 50\%, finding a community with a total of 48 species,
   of which 18 were living representatives. The historical analysis was
   conducted based on a review of the area specimens deposited in national
   scientific collections, as well as records of species reported in the
   literature. Contrasting sampling with historical analysis, we observed a
   decrease locally critical in the number of species of large sizes and
   ornamental value, which reflects the urgency to realize and implement a
   management plan in the area.},

Abstract = {As a part of a series of ongoing studies on trichodinids of freshwater
   fishes of Mexico, several species from diverse localities in the Cuatro
   Cienegas region, Coahuila, northern Mexico, were examined. Wet smears of
   gills and skin were made fresh and screened for the presence of
   trichodinids under light microscopy. Additional specimens were fixed for
   SEM. The only trichodinid species found was Trichodina mutabilis, a
   parasite of the characid fish Astyanax mexicanus. This ciliate protozoan
   has been introduced from Asia to many countries, including Mexico, with
   its original host, the Asian carps. The present record is the first for
   Mexico and the second in North America, being the first record of a
   Trichodina species for native wild freshwater fish in a natural
   environment in Mexico, since all previous records were from exotic
   cultured fishes.},

Abstract = {This study reports for the first time the pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides,
   as a host of the isopod Cymothoa excisa, and shows the influence of
   parasitism in the morphometric growth of the pinfish obtained from La
   Carbonera, a tropical coastal lagoon on the northwestern coast of the
   Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. A total of 448 pinfish were collected between
   April 2009 and March 2010. Twenty-eight individuals were found to host
   the parasite, with a prevalence of 6.2\%. Additionally, we obtained the
   length-weight relationships (W= a Lt(b)) between individuals with
   parasites (a= 0.0005; b= 2.31) and those without (a= 0.00003; b= 2.91).
   Parameters a and b differed between groups (p< 0.05). The population of
   L. rhomboides is affected by the presence of the isopod parasite, C.
   excisa; differences in the length-weight relationship indicates that C.
   excisa is a risk factor for this and other fish species in the study

   the mitochondrial genome and six nuclear genes (2419 and 3909 base pairs
   in total, respectively) for 31 samples belonging to the 16 previously
   recognized species of Phrynosoma and the new species. The new species is
   strongly supported in maximum likelihood analyses of both the
   concatenated mitochondrial and nuclear data as a monophyletic, distinct
   evolutionary lineage sister to, and moderately divergent from, P.
   taurus, and highly divergent from all of the other species of
   Phrynosoma. A Bayesian species tree analysis also strongly supports the

Abstract = {A limited number of studies have focused on the population genetic
   structure of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in America. This
   medium-sized bat is distributed in tropical areas of the continent with
   high prevalence in forested livestock areas. The aim of this work was to
   characterize the vampire population structure and their genetic
   differentiation. For this, we followed standard methods by which live
   vampires (caught by mist-netting) and preserved material from scientific
   collections, were obtained for a total of 15 different locations,
   ranging from Chihuahua (North) to Quintana Roo (Southeast). Tissue
   samples were obtained from both live and collected animals, and the
   genetic differentiation, within and among localities, was assessed by
   the use of seven microsatellite loci. Our results showed that all loci
   were polymorphic and no private alleles were detected. High levels of
   heterozygosis were detected when the proportion of alleles in each locus
   were compared. Pairwise F-ST and R-ST detected significant genetic
   differentiation among individuals from different localities. Our
   population structure results indicate the presence of eleven clusters,
   with a high percentage of assigned individuals to some specific
   collecting site.},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Cloud forest in Mexico is one of the most fragile biomes, wherein some
   species of Fagaceae family play a key ecological role. Based on data
   from reviews of herbarium material, publications of Mexican cloud
   forest, field visits and Mexico's cloud forest biodiversity information
   system housed by Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de in
   Biodiversidad, we present an analysis of the Fagaceae family in the
   cloud forests of Mexico, with special emphasis in the 13 main regions
   proposed by Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la
   Biodiversidad as priority for the conservation of cloud forests in the
   country. Likewise, we compiled the risk categories of the Fagaceae
   family from the cloud forest. Results show that the family is
   represented in this community by 46 species of Quercus (32 from the
   Lobatae section and 14 from the Quercus section), and one species of
   Fagus. Thirteen of these species are considered exclusive or almost
   exclusive to this community and endemic to Mexico. Among the priority
   regions, region III (Huasteca Alta Hidalguense) is the most diverse with
   26 species; while region VII (Los Tuxtlas) is the less diverse with only
   two species. The beta diversity analysis shows intermediate to high
   rates between the 13 regions (from 0.41-1). Most similar regions in
   Fagaceae species were III (Huasteca Alta Hidalguense) and V (Centro de
   Veracruz). The Fagaceae species of Mexican cloud forest classified in
   some level of risk or threat are 41. Among them, we highlight eight oak
   species of section Lobatae, considered critically endangered, and five
   of section Quercus in the same category.},

Title = {Effect of a red oak species gradient on genetic structure and diversity

Journal = {TREE GENETICS \& GENOMES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {641-652},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Incipient reproductive barriers are a common characteristic of oak
   species. Disruption of these barriers promotes changes in diversity and
   genetic structure of the species involved. Quercus castanea is a red oak
   with wide geographic distribution in Mexico, which presents atypically
   high morphological variability when it occurs in sympatry with other red
   oak species, suggesting that hybridization may explain the observed
   variation. We tested if the genetic structure and diversity levels of Q.
   castanea are related to the number of red oak species growing in
   sympatry. In total, 14 microsatellite (SSRs) primers (six nSSRs and
   eight cpSSRs) were used in 120 Q. castanea individuals (20/site)
   belonging to six populations, where the number of red oak species
   associated varied from zero to five. Results showed a positive and
   significant relationship between the genetic diversity of Q. castanea
   and the number of red oak species growing in sympatry, regardless of the
   marker type or the parameter of genetic diversity analyzed. Also, we
   found a higher genetic differentiation of Q. castanea populations using
   cpSSRs in comparison with nSSRs. Our results suggest that temperate
   forests with high red oaks species richness co-dominated by Q. castanea
   promote the increase in this species genetic diversity. From a
   conservation perspective, high genetic diversity levels of foundation
   species such as Q. castanea may have positive cascade effects extending
   to other species in the community.},

Abstract = {The viviparous lizards of the Sceloporus genus exhibit both seasonal and
   continuous spermatogenesis. The viviparous lizard Sceloporus mucronatus
   from Tecocomulco, Hidalgo, M,xico, exhibits seasonal spermatogenesis.
   This study demonstrates the relationship between changes in testis
   volume, spermatogenesis activity, and Leydig cells during the male
   reproductive cycle of S. mucronatus. A recrudescence period is evident,
   which starts in the winter when testicular volume is reduced and
   climaxes in February, when the greatest mitotic activity of
   spermatogonia occurs. The testicular volume and Leydig cell index
   increase gradually during the spring with primary spermatocytes being
   the most abundant cell type observed within the germinal epithelium. In
   the summer, the secondary spermatocytes and undifferentiated round
   spermatids are the most abundant germinal cells. The breeding season
   coincides with spermiogenesis and spermiation; testicular volume also
   increases significantly as does the Leydig cell index where these cells
   increase in both cytoplasmic and nuclear volume. During fall, testicular
   regression begins with a significant decrease in testicular volume and
   germinal epithelium height, although there are remnant spermatozoa left
   within the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. During this time, the
   Leydig cell index is also reduced, and there is a decrease in cellular
   and nuclear volumes within these interstitial cells. Finally, during
   quiescence in late fall, there is reduced testicular volume smaller than
   during regression, and only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells are present
   within the seminiferous tubules. Leydig cells exhibit a low index
   number, their cellular and nuclear volumes are reduced, and there is a
   depletion in lipid inclusion cytoplasmically.},

Abstract = {In arid ecosystems, biological soil crusts closely interact with
   microarthropod communities. Together, both communities play one of the
   most important environmental services: decomposition of organic matter.
   In a desert scrub in the southern Baja California Peninsula of Mexico,
   microarthropod communities were correlated to biological soil crusts and
   the way soil properties influence distribution of the microarthropods.
   Twenty five soil samples were taken from 3 site types: without crusts
   (10), with crusts (10), and eroded surfaces (5). Microarthropods were
   extracted; specimens were identified to family level and feeding groups
   were identified. Of the 4 682 microarthropods within 40 taxa,
   Prostigmata had the greatest richness. The lack of plant coverage at
   eroded sites seems to affect micro-environmental conditions, so that no
   microarthropods were found at these sites and biological soil crusts
   were simple in structure. Among desert scrub, biological soil crusts
   were complex in structure, and edaphic properties were more favorable
   for microarthropods to thrive. Specific dissimilarities in community
   structure of microarthropods for each microhabitat were related to
   feeding preferences of each taxa.},

Title = {A novel motif in the NaTrxh N-terminus promotes its secretion, whereas

   vitro},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background: NaTrxh, a thioredoxin type h, shows differential expression
   between self-incompatible and self-compatible Nicotiana species. NaTrxh
   interacts in vitro with S-RNase and co-localizes with it in the
   extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tissue. NaTrxh contains
   N- and C-terminal extensions, a feature shared by thioredoxin h proteins
   of subgroup 2. To ascertain the function of these extensions in NaTrxh
   secretion and protein-protein interaction, we performed a deletion
   analysis on NaTrxh and fused the resulting variants to GFP.
   Results: We found an internal domain in the N-terminal extension, called
   N beta, that is essential for NaTrxh secretion but is not hydrophobic, a
   canonical feature of a signal peptide. The lack of hydrophobicity as
   well as the location of the secretion signal within the NaTrxh primary
   structure, suggest an unorthodox secretion route for NaTrxh. Notably, we
   found that the fusion protein NaTrxh-GFP(KDEL) is retained in the
   endoplasmic reticulum and that treatment of NaTrxh-GFP-expressing cells
   with Brefeldin A leads to its retention in the Golgi, which indicates
   that NaTrxh uses, to some extent, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
   apparatus for secretion. Furthermore, we found that N beta contributes
   to NaTrxh tertiary structure stabilization and that the C-terminus
   functions in the protein-protein interaction with S-RNase.
   Conclusions: The extensions contained in NaTrxh sequence have specific
   functions on the protein. While the C-terminus directly participates in
   protein-protein interaction, particularly on its interaction with
   S-RNase in vitro; the N-terminal extension contains two structurally
   different motifs: N alpha and N beta. N beta, the inner domain (Ala-17
   to Pro-27), is essential and enough to target NaTrxh towards the
   apoplast. Interestingly, when it was fused to GFP, this protein was also
   found in the cell wall of the onion cells. Although the biochemical
   features of the N-terminus suggested a non-classical secretion pathway,
   our results provided evidence that NaTrxh at least uses the endoplasmic
   reticulum, Golgi apparatus and also vesicles for secretion. Therefore,
   the N beta domain sequence is suggested to be a novel signal peptide.},

   chromatography (TLC) and assayed in vitro for acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) inhibitory activity using Spodoptera frugiperda homogenates as
   source of enzyme. Derivatised chromatographic plates indicated the
   presence of indoles and alkaloids in the extracts. The crude alkaloid
   extract exhibited a higher number of compounds than the methanolic
   extract as judged by the number of spots on TLC plates. The crude
   alkaloid extract had a weak inhibition potential of AChE with a lower
   IC50 (93gmL(-1)) than the methanolic extract (159gmL(-1)). Indole
   alkaloids may be responsible for the activity, though a subsequent
   analysis of the extract components is necessary to determine the active
   alkaloid(s).},

Title = {Revealing the Pathogenic and Aging-related Mechanisms of the Enigmatic
   Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis An Integral Model},

Abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant activation of
   alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts in an aging lung plays a
   critical role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
   (IPF). However, the biopathological processes linking aging with IPF and
   the mechanisms responsible for the abnormal activation of epithelial
   cells and fibroblasts have not been elucidated. Many of the hallmarks of
   aging (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic
   alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence) have
   been proposed as essential mechanisms for the development of IPF;
   however, these disturbances are not restricted to IPF and also occur in
   other aging-related lung disorders, primarily chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, an unanswered question is why a
   current/former smoker of about 60 years of age with shorter telomeres,
   alveolar epithelial senescence, excessive oxidative stress, and
   mitochondrial dysfunction develops IPF and not COPD; in other words,
   what makes old lungs specifically susceptible to develop IPF? In this
   Perspective, we propose an integral model in which the combination of
   some gene variants and/or gene expression in the aging lung results in
   the loss of epithelial integrity and consequently in the failure of the
   alveoli to correctly respond to injury and to face the stress associated
   with mechanical stretch. Afterward, a distinctive epigenetic
   ``reprogramming{''} that affects both epithelial cells and fibroblasts
   provokes, among others, the recapitulation of developmental pathways and
   the aberrant activation and miscommunication between both cell types,
   resulting in the exaggerated production and accumulation of
   extracellular matrix and the subsequent destruction of the lung
   architecture.},

Title = {Multilocus phylogeography and morphology give insights into the recent
   evolution of a Mexican endemic songbird: Vireo hypochryseus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-263},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We used multilocus phylogeographic analyses, morphometric measurements,
   and environmental niche models (ENMs) to analyze the recent evolution of
   the golden vireo Vireo hypochryseus, a Mexican endemic species. Vireo
   hypochryseus is made up of two phylogeographically structured
   mitochondrial DNA clades that probably diverged 132 000 yr ago. One
   clade comprised individuals from mainland Sinaloa and the Tres Marias
   islands in the northwest, and the other included individuals from the
   remaining range of the species. This marked phylogeographic structure
   contrasts with the low genetic structure reported for temperate North
   American vireos. The nuclear DNA markers also showed some geographic
   differences in allele frequency, but did not exhibit a clear
   phylogeographic structure. The morphometric analyses suggested a
   decreasing north to south cline, with the largest individuals located in
   the Tres Marias islands. The ENMs did not support a scenario of
   geographic fragmentation of the environmental conditions of the area in
   which V. hypochryseus has inhabited over the last 130 000 yr. However, a
   model of isolation by resistance based on the actual configuration of
   climatic conditions in western Mexico did explain a major proportion of
   both the mitochondrial DNA distances and the differences in size, while
   a model of isolation by distance explain a low proportion of such
   differences. Therefore, the recent history of V. hypochryseus was likely
   shaped by historical habitat fragmentation due to fluctuating
   environmental conditions in the mainland that produced a phylogeographic
   print, and natural selection on morphological traits in the insular
   population, suggesting an active diversification of endemic lineages in
   the Mexican dry forest.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Observations of air bubble growth in a quiescent liquid and in a liquid
   cross-flow by means of a high-speed camera and piezoelectric-hydrophone
   in a synchronous experimental setup are performed. Using the passive
   acoustical method, one observes a beat-wave phenomenon when the feed
   magnitude of liquid cross-flow is increased from 43 to 128 mm/s and this
   is corroborated by the appearance of peaks in spectral and spectrogram
   analyses respectively. A fit to experimental data by a theoretical-model
   indicates that the beat-signal is the result of under and overdamped
   systems. The bubble video-images show the asymmetric travel of
   bubble-surface ripples after the neck collapse. The acoustic comparison
   exhibits a beat signal as a result of capillary - wave superposition,
   which is in agreement with earlier results on bubble fragmentation in a
   locally sheared flow. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Environmental determinism and neutrality in vegetation at millennial

Volume = {25},

Pages = {627-635},

Abstract = {Questions
   At millennial scales, is the historic evolution of tropical plant
   communities the result of `random walk'? Are presence and abundance of
   taxa independent of environmental variability?
   Location
   Lake Peten-Itza, Guatemala, Central American lowlands.
   Methods
   We use an 86000-yr-long pollen record to study the relative contribution
   of neutral mechanisms and environmental determinism in configuring
   vegetation in the Central American lowlands. By using variance ratios,
   we evaluated the role of neutral drift at community and functional group
   levels. Additionally, regression analyses were applied to explain
   persistence and abundance of individual taxa as a function of regional
   moisture availability and fire frequency.
   Results
   Environmental fluctuations drove vegetation dynamics in the Central
   American lowlands during the late Pleistocene. When the data set was
   stratified according to moisture availability and fire frequency,
   variance ratios further supported our findings. Regression analyses
   revealed that whereas species' presence was independent of both moisture
   availability and fire frequency, their abundance was closely associated
   with both.
   Conclusions
   Neutrality, probably expressed in the face of stressors, through factors
   such as the existence of microrefugia, survival of relictual individuals
   and phenotypic and phenologic plasticity, was probably crucial in
   preventing biodiversity losses. Climate, however, was the main driver of
   vegetation dynamics in the Yucatan Peninsula during the late
   Pleistocene.},

Journal = {MAMMALIA},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {We analyzed whether the spatial variation in mammal species richness
   reflects the southern boundaries of the Nearctic region as previously
   established by endemism patterns. Records from 710 mammal species were
   drawn on a map of North America (from Canada and Alaska to Panama)
   gridded at 4 degrees latitude-longitude. We evaluated the probable
   existence of unknown species through three richness estimators (Chao2,
   ICE, and Jack1), modeled the potential distribution of species, and
   mapped the predicted pattern of species richness through the number of
   coexisting potential distributions. The poorest grid cells are in the
   northern areas, whereas the richest ones are in the southern areas,
   coinciding with the pattern of collecting points. The average richness
   of 4 degrees grid cells comprising the Nearctic region was 18 species,
   and the richest 4 degrees grid cells had 150 species, coinciding with
   the 26 inverted perpendicular latitude. From the 406 mammal species of
   the Nearctic region, 104 are restricted to it, and 305 species situated
   south of it are not distributed in the region. The map of predicted
   richness shows the classical latitudinal diversity gradient, with the
   number of species increasing to the tropics. We conclude that the
   Nearctic region has a low mammal richness, with a richness pattern
   corresponding with previously described patterns of endemism, with a
   boundary situated at 26 degrees-30 degrees latitude.},

Title = {Temporal dynamics of areas of endemism under climate change: a case
   study of Mexican Bursera (Burseraceae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {871-881},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Aim
   Our aim was to analyse the temporal dynamics of areas of endemism of
   Bursera species (Burseraceae), a dominant element of the Mexican
   tropical dry forest, between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the
   present day. We aimed to identify stable core sectors that have held
   permanent populations of endemic species.
   Location
   Mexican dry forest.
   Methods
   We modelled the geographical distributions of 81 species of Bursera and
   identified their areas of endemism at the LGM and at present. For each
   area of endemism, changes in time, species composition and distribution
   were analysed, and a spatially explicit temporal hypothesis was
   formulated.
   Results
   Three areas of endemism supported by geographically congruent elements
   were identified: the Central Mexican Pacific Coast, Western Balsas, and
   Eastern Balsas-Tehuacan/Cuicatlan-Tehuantepec. Within them we identified
   stable core sectors (refugia).
   Main conclusions
   The areas of endemism identified represent distinct evolutionary biotic
   components of the Mexican dry forest. Their stable core sectors may
   facilitate phylogeographical predictions at the level of species or
   species assemblages. The framework adopted allows us to formulate
   spatially explicit temporal hypotheses about biotic processes, based
   exclusively on geographical data.},

Abstract = {The white-rot fungus Phlebia brevispora BAFC 633 produces laccases in
   large proportions. In this work P. brevispora BAFC 633 was grown on
   Pinus taeda wood chips in 10-L bioreactors. To select the biopulping
   experimental conditions, we analyzed the variables affecting enzymatic
   laccase activity in the culture supernatants, indicating that the
   suitable incubation temperature was 30 degrees C in order to promote
   enzyme stability. Phlebia brevispora BAFC 633 secreted 744 U/g of
   laccase, selectively removing lignin during biotreatment of wood chips,
   causing a reduction in Kappa number and 10\% weight loss, and creating a
   more open structure and better access to the pulping liquor, which would
   require less chemical consumption, thus diminishing the environmental
   impact of the chemical pulping process.
   These results support the biotechnological potential of P. brevispora
   BAFC 633 for biopulping processes and enhance the potential for
   bioprospecting native isolates of the microflora of our country's
   natural environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The recognition of areas of endemism (AEs) is important for conservation
   biology and biogeographical regionalization. Our objective was to
   quantitatively identify AEs and distributional congruence patterns of
   native rodents at the tropical/temperate transition in the central
   Andes. We analysed 6200 geo-referenced distributional records of 80
   species in north-western Argentina using NDM/VNDM software. We found 20
   AEs defined by 22 endemic species (27\% of the total rodent fauna) and
   34 patterns of distributional congruence in non-endemic rodents.
   Geographical range congruence follows two main patterns running parallel
   along the Andes. One is related to the humid eastern slopes of the Andes
   (Argentinean Yungas forest) and the other to the high Andes (Argentinean
   Puna plateau). Endemism was mainly restricted to the southernmost part
   of the Yungas forest and adjacent dryer valleys (Monte desert). Species
   diversity was highest in the northern sector of the Argentinean Yungas
   forest, where several species reach their southern distributional range.
   This incongruence among hotspots of diversity and endemism has also been
   also noted in diversity studies at continental and global scales. Our
   results provide a starting point for conservation planning in the
   southernmost Central Andes, which combines the taper of tropical
   diversity and range-restricted species endemic to the tropical-temperate
   transition. (c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal

Title = {Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) revisited},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {842-854},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Several methods have been proposed for use in identifying and
   classifying areas of endemism. Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) is
   the most widely used. It constructs cladograms based on the cladistic
   analysis of presence-absence data matrices of species and supraspecific
   taxa. Several authors have criticized PAE, usually because they have
   misunderstood its theoretical basis. A summary of the procedure is
   presented here, along with a discussion of the interpretation of PAE
   cladograms. Some critics deny any place in evolutionary biogeography for
   non-phylogenetic approaches, but I believe evolutionary biogeography is
   a pluralistic discipline, where PAE has a place despite lacking a
   strictly phylogenetic perspective, and thus can be applied as the first
   step in an analysis. Other authors criticize the use of PAE as a
   cladistic biogeographical method, although their arguments may be
   circular because they refer to biogeographical analyses based on
   phylogenetic hypotheses. Finally, the use of PAE for identifying areas
   of endemism has been criticized because an optimality criterion is used
   a posteriori to select areas of endemism found by what have been
   considered as less appropriate means, and endemicity analysis (EA) has
   proved to be more efficient than PAE for identifying areas of endemism.
   Over the last few decades PAE has been used extensively to identify
   areas of endemism and to determine their relationships, playing a
   relevant role in evolutionary biogeography.},

Title = {Brighter branes, enhancement of photon production by strong magnetic
   fields in the gauge/gravity correspondence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {We use the gauge/gravity correspondence to calculate the rate of photon
   production in a strongly coupled N = 4 plasma in the presence of an
   intense magnetic field. We start by constructing a family of back
   reacted geometries that include the black D3-brane solution, as a smooth
   limiting case for B = 0, and extends to backgrounds with an arbitrarily
   large constant magnetic field. This family provides the gravitational
   dual of a field theory in the presence of a very strong magnetic field
   which intensity can be fixed as desired and allows us to study its
   effect on the photon production of a quark-gluon plasma. The inclusion
   of perturbations in the electromagnetic field on these backgrounds is
   consistent only if the metric is perturbed as well, so we use methods
   developed to treat operator mixing to manage these general
   perturbations. Our results show a clear enhancement of photon production
   with a significant anisotropy, which, in qualitative agreement with the
   experiments of heavy ion collisions, is particularly noticeable for low
   P.},

Volume = {447},

Abstract = {In this work, the presence of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) was
   determined in different cell subpopulations in the left growing and
   right regressing ovaries of Gallus domesticus from 13-day-old chicken
   embryos to one-month-old chickens by immunohistochemistry. Results
   revealed positive ER-a immunostaining in both ovaries during
   development, but the percentage, staining intensity, and cellular
   distribution of ER-a immunostaining changes according to whether it is
   the left or right ovary and with the animal's age. In the left ovary,
   the ER-a was localized in the nuclei of the germinal epithelium and in
   germ cells of the ovarian cortex, as well as in the interstitial cells,
   undifferentiated cells, and epithelial cells of the lacunar channels of
   the ovarian medulla in all ages. In contrast, in the right ovary from
   13-day-old chicken embryos to one-week-old chickens, only the epithelial
   cells of lacunar channels were ER-a immunoreactive, but in the right
   ovary of one-month-old chickens both the epithelial cells of lacunar
   channels and the interstitial cells presented ER-a. These results
   demonstrate differential expression of ER-a in both chicken ovaries
   during development in a cell type-specific distribution, suggesting that
   these differences may be regarded as an important cause in the process
   of asymmetric ovarian development in the chicken. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Climate Change and the Distribution of Neotropical RedBellied Toads
   (Melanophryniscus, Anura, Amphibia): How to Prioritize Species
   and Populations?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {We used species distribution modeling to investigate the potential
   effects of climate change on 24 species of Neotropical anurans of the
   genus Melanophryniscus. These toads are small, have limited mobility,
   and a high percentage are endangered or present restricted geographical
   distributions. We looked at the changes in the size of suitable climatic
   regions and in the numbers of known occurrence sites within the
   distribution limits of all species. We used the MaxEnt algorithm to
   project current and future suitable climatic areas (a consensus of IPCC
   scenarios A2a and B2a for 2020 and 2080) for each species. 40\% of the
   species may lose over 50\% of their potential distribution area by 2080,
   whereas 28\% of species may lose less than 10\%. Four species had over
   40\% of the currently known occurrence sites outside the predicted 2080
   areas. The effect of climate change (decrease in climatic suitable
   areas) did not differ according to the present distribution area, major
   habitat type or phylogenetic group of the studied species. We used the
   estimated decrease in specific suitable climatic range to set a
   conservation priority rank for Melanophryniscus species. Four species
   were set to high conservation priority: M. montevidensis, (100\% of its
   original suitable range and all known occurrence points potentially lost
   by 2080), M. sp.2, M. cambaraensis, and M. tumifrons. Three species (M.
   spectabilis, M. stelzneri, and M. sp.3) were set between high to
   intermediate priority (more than 60\% decrease in area predicted by
   2080); nine species were ranked as intermediate priority, while eight
   species were ranked as low conservation priority. We suggest that
   monitoring and conservation actions should be focused primarily on those
   species and populations that are likely to lose the largest area of
   suitable climate and the largest number of known populations in the
   short-term.},

Abstract = {A formulated diet for Octopus maya that provoked a growth rate and
   survival higher than that observed when animals were fed diet based only
   on freeze-dried crab is reported for first time. Early juveniles (0.37 g
   wet weight; ww) of O. maya were used. Diets were made by mixing
   freeze-dried ingredients (crab paste; Callinectes spp. meal; (Cr), squid
   meal; Dosidicus gigas (Sq) and silages (Si)) all enriched with a mix of
   vitamins and minerals, and bound with gelatin, forming a paste. At the
   end of the experiment, Crab-Squid (CrSq) was the only diet that showed
   100\% survival, followed by Crab (Cr) (55\%). The highest specific
   growth rate (SGR, \% day(-1)) was obtained in animals fed CrSq (3.04\%
   day-1) followed by animals fed Cr (1.96\% day(-1)) and Squid (Sq)
   (1.09\% day(-1)). Marginal (0.36\% day(-1)) and negative (-0.73\% day-1)
   SGR values were observed in animals fed Silage-Crab-Squid (SiCrSq) and
   Silage-Squid (SiSq). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that
   muscle glycogen and DG protein contents had the strongest influence on
   the separation of groups in a canonical analysis and were positively
   related with growth indicating that CrSq diets have the best nutritional
   characteristics to satisfy growth requirements. These results were
   confirmed when energy balance was measured. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A compact convex subset K of a topological linear space is called a
   Keller compactum if it is affinely homeomorphic to an

   Let G be a compact topological group acting affinely on a Keller
   compactum K and let 2(K) denote the hyperspace of all non-empty compact
   subsets of K endowed with the Hausdorff metric topology and the induced
   action of G. Further, let cc(K) denote the subspace of 2(K) consisting
   of all compact convex subsets of K. In a particular case, the main
   result of the paper asserts that if K is centrally symmetric, then the
   orbit spaces 2(K)/G and cc(K)/G are homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube.

Abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the morphological and molecular
   characterization of the cyanobacterium Brasilonema robertilamii from
   populations found in Central Mexico. The general growth form and the
   morphological, morphometric and ecological characteristics of the
   populations studied clearly correspond to those described for
   Brasilonema roberti-lamii ( basionym: Tolypothrix roberti-lamii) from
   the French Antilles. Based on molecular data from DNA sequencing of
   the16S rRNA gene and the IGS of the cpcB-cpcA phycocyanin operon
   (cpcBA-IGS), we propose that the populations that we studied are closely
   related to those of other Brasilonema species, including B. octagenarum
   UFV-OR1, UFV-E1 and HA4187-MV1p1F, Brasilonema sennae CENA 114, B.
   tolantongensis, B. terrestre CENA 116, B. angustatum HA4187-MV1-B2+ p1F
   and HA4187-MV1-B2+ p1H and B. bromeliae SPC951. Our findings support the
   transference of Tolypothrix roberti-lamii, which was made based
   exclusively on morphological criteria, to Brasilonema. The use of
   molecular analyses in addition to traditional morphological and
   ecological criteria, known as polyphasic approach, is a good alternative
   to describe taxa of cyanobacteria, mainly at the genus and species
   levels.},

Journal = {PHYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The morphology and phenology of Paralemanea mexicana (Kutzing) Vis et
   Sheath was evaluated seasonally in a fifth order high-altitude stream in
   central Mexico. The gametophytes grew during oligotrophic and eutrophic
   conditions, and during particular microhabitat conditions: high current
   velocity (40-240 cm s(-1)), low to medium irradiance (5-973 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1)), and shallow depth (1-30 cm). The abundance of
   gametophytes was positively correlated with low temperature, high
   current velocity and concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus.
   Interestingly, monoecious gametophytes formed two types of branches,
   true branches with sympodial pattern originating from meristematic cells
   in variable number, and abundant false branches produced during the
   development of the `Chantransia' stage in the surface of the gametophyte
   or by uniseriate filaments arising within the thallus lumen. These
   filaments generally produce gametophytes and suggest that they could
   support the germination of carpospores. The frequently whorled branches
   are the result of a false branching pattern and are exclusive to P.
   mexicana. These morphological and reproductive characteristics appear to
   be biomechanical adaptations to avoid detachment and increase
   reproductive success. Efficient reproductive strategies of P. mexicana
   observed in this study can be interpreted as adaptations to successfully
   colonize streams; however, these features may not have been common in
   the study region due to restricted microhabitat conditions and
   geographic isolation.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, community participation has become central in
   biodiversity conservation initiatives, mainly as a strategy for
   integrating the needs and interests of the populations living in and
   around protected areas (PAs), and to enhance local social development.
   Nevertheless, institutionalised participation is usually conceived as a
   means to attain the goals of conservation initiatives. Although
   important efforts have been made to construct participatory processes,
   these are designed and implemented in ways that produce exclusion. In
   this study, we analyse the exclusion processes produced in the
   consultation workshops developed to evaluate and update the Conservation
   and Management Programme (CMP) of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve
   (MABR), and in the Reserve's Advisory Council (Consejo Asesor) meetings.
   Our analysis is based on the observation of two workshops, the revision
   of workshop reports, interviews with institutional officials, and the
   participation of one of us in the Advisory Council of the MABR as a
   councillor. We show that participatory processes for incorporating local
   population's views and perspectives into decision-making processes still
   face important challenges. We highlight the importance of acknowledging,
   and attending to, the processes of exclusion generated by the mechanisms
   themselves, despite being implemented to include local communities.},

Abstract = {Mathematical models have been very useful in biological research. From
   the interaction of biology and mathematics, new problems have emerged
   that have generated advances in the theory, suggested further
   experimental work and motivated plausible conjectures. From our
   perspective, it is absolutely necessary to incorporate modeling tools in
   the study of circadian rhythms and that without a solid mathematical
   framework a real understanding of them will not be possible. Our
   interest is to study the main process underlying the synchronization in
   the pacemaker of a circadian system: these mechanisms should be
   conserved in all living beings. Indeed, from an evolutionary
   perspective, it seems reasonable to assume that either they have a
   common origin or that they emerge from similar selection circumstances.
   We propose a general framework to understand the emergence of
   synchronization as a robust characteristic of some cooperative systems
   of non-linear coupled oscillators. In a first approximation to the
   problem we vary the topology of the network and the strength of the
   interactions among oscillators. In order to study the emergent dynamics,
   we carried out some numerical computations. The results are consistent
   with experiments reported in the literature. Finally, we proposed a
   theoretical framework to study the phenomenon of synchronization in the
   context of circadian rhythms: the dissipative synchronization of
   nonautonomous dynamical systems.},

Abstract = {To resolve the taxonomic status of Ralfsia hancockii and its
   relationship to related species, we have carried out a morphological and
   molecular study ( rbcL) on the topotype material of the species. Our
   analyses, using maximum parsimony and Bayesian posterior probability,
   located this species in a clade that is distinct and distant from other
   species of the genus Ralfsia and other genera of the family Ralfsiaceae,
   but is shared with the family Neoralfsiaceae. Morphological data
   confirmed that the presence of unangia with ( 2-) 3-6 stalk cells and
   mostly unilateral symmetry with partial bilateral development is
   characteristic of this species and distinguishes it from the
   morphologically similar Neoralfsia expansa sensu Borgesen. Similarities
   to N. expansa sensu Tanaka and Chihara, from which the latter species is
   distinguished by having paraphyses with thinner and larger basal cells,
   are discussed. We propose Neoralfsia hancockii comb. nov.},

Abstract = {The regeneration of temperate forests is important, especially for those
   located in urban areas. Sources of propagules, such as seed rain, shape
   the structure and composition of systems where the availability of
   diaspores from forest species contribute to both local biodiversity and
   ecosystem services; these elements are crucial in Mexico City. Over the
   course of one year, we estimated natural regeneration potential through
   an analysis of the seed rain deposited in traps that were placed at soil
   level in plots in three vegetation types: oak, fir and pine forests. We
   addressed the following questions: Do abundance, density, species
   composition and diversity of seed rain differ among vegetation types and
   seasons? How similar is the seed rain to the standing vegetation? Is
   seed rain a potential source for the natural regeneration of temperate
   forests? The results showed that the abundance and density of seeds were
   significantly higher for oak and fir forests due to a higher number of
   herb, shrub, and tree species in the standing vegetation. The most
   abundant species in the total seed rain was Ageratina enixa (B.L. Rob.)
   R.M. King \& H. Rob. (12\%), but inside individual forest plots, the
   most abundant were Quercus rugosa Nee (16\%), Abies religiosa (Kunth)
   Schltdl. \& Cham. (17.5\%) and Pinus hartwegii Lindl. (41\%). Diversity
   index values differed among vegetation types but not seasons. Most
   diaspores in the seed rain corresponded to native species (97\%). The
   similarity between seed rain and the standing vegetation was 40\%. In
   total, 62\% of the species are anemochorous, as a result of the high
   number of Asteraceae species present, and endozoochory is the second
   most important (17\%) dispersal syndrome. A slight asynchrony was
   observed between the peaks of anemochorous and zoochorous species.},

Title = {Countryside biogeography of Neotropical reptiles and amphibians},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {The future of biodiversity and ecosystem services depends largely on the
   capacity of human-dominated ecosystems to support them, yet this
   capacity remains largely unknown. Using the framework of countryside
   biogeography, and working in the Las Cruces system of Coto Brus, Costa
   Rica, we assessed reptile and amphibian assemblages within four habitats
   that typify much of the Neotropics: sun coffee plantations (12 sites),
   pasture (12 sites), remnant forest elements (12 sites), and a larger,
   contiguous protected forest (3 sites in one forest). Through analysis of
   1678 captures of 67 species, we draw four primary conclusions. First, we
   found that the majority of reptile (60\%) and amphibian (70\%) species
   in this study used an array of habitat types, including coffee
   plantations and actively grazed pastures. Second, we found that coffee
   plantations and pastures hosted rich, albeit different and less dense,
   reptile and amphibian biodiversity relative to the 326-ha Las Cruces
   Forest Reserve and neighboring forest elements. Third, we found that the
   small ribbons of ``countryside forest elements{''} weaving through
   farmland collectively increased the effective size of a 326-ha local
   forest reserve 16-fold for reptiles and 14-fold for amphibians within
   our 236-km(2) study area. Therefore, countryside forest elements, often
   too small for most remote sensing techniques to identify, are
   contributing similar to 95\% of the available habitat for
   forest-dependent reptiles and amphibians in our largely human-dominated
   study region. Fourth, we found large and pond-reproducing amphibians to
   prefer human-made habitats, whereas small, stream-reproducing, and
   directly developing species are more dependent on forest elements. Our
   investigation demonstrates that tropical farming landscapes can support
   substantial reptile and amphibian biodiversity. Our approach provides a
   framework for estimating the conservation value of the complex working
   landscapes that constitute roughly half of the global land surface, and
   which are experiencing intensification pressure worldwide.},

Abstract = {The nutritional value of four meals made from animal by-products of
   squid (SBM), tuna (TBM), poultry (PBM) and pork (POBM), and their
   potential use in diets for Octopus maya were evaluated. Lyophilized
   crab-meat meal (CRM) (Callinectes sapidus) was used as a reference for
   the nutritional requirements of the octopus. CRM had the highest crude
   protein (CP) content (847.2 g kg(-1)) and the lowest lipid content (27.5
   g kg(-1)). SBM and PBM had more than 700 g kg(-1) CP content, while TBM
   and POBM had less than 600 g kg(-1). Lipid content varied between 75.3
   (SBM) and 127.2 (PBM) g kg(-1). Energy content of CRM was 17.5 MJ
   kg(-1), and the maximum difference with respect to the by-product meals
   did not exceed 3 MJ kg(-1). Amino acid analysis showed that SBM and PBM
   had high content of Thr, Ser and Ala, which are the most important amino
   acids for the metabolism of O. maya. Fatty acid analysis showed that
   they also had a high content of PUFA. PBM showed deficiencies in EPA and
   HA content, but had a high content of linoleic acid, which can be a
   precursor of C:20 and C:22. Based on this, SBM and PBM have nutritional
   qualities which could be adequate for use as primary protein sources in
   artificial diets for O. maya.},

Abstract = {The geometrical structure, chemical ordering, electronic and magnetic
   properties of ConPtm-n for M=13, 19, and 55, are investigated, within
   the framework of the density functional theory as implemented in the
   SIESTA code. For the exchange and correlation potential, we used the
   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA). We considered the hexagonal, the cubo-octahedral
   (CO), the centered pentagonal prism (CPP), and the icosahedral (ICO)
   geometries. We found that the CO, ICO, and CPP structures have similar
   energies and the lowest energy configuration changes as a function of
   the Co concentration and cluster size. In most of the cases, around the
   equiatomic concentration, the Co and Pt atoms form chemically ordered
   structures, but most often not the L1(0) structure stable in bulk. We
   observed that the Pt atoms are segregated to the surface in all the
   concentration range. A detailed analysis of the dependence of the
   magnetic moment of the components, and their average, as a function of
   structure and of chemical composition is reported. A strong polarization
   of the Pt atoms by the nearest neighbor Co atoms is observed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {A cladistic biogeographical analysis was undertaken to identify the main
   events in the biotic diversification of the terrestrial Neotropical
   biota. For the 36 animal and plant taxa analysed, a componentxarea
   matrix was constructed, associating geographical data only with
   informative nodes, and it was analysed under implied weights using the
   software TNT. The general area cladogram obtained shows that the
   Neotropical region constitutes a monophyletic unit, with a first split
   separating the Antilles and a second one dividing the continental areas
   into a north-western and a south-eastern component. Within the
   north-western component the areas split following the sequence northern
   Amazonia, south-western Amazonia, north-western South America, and
   Mesoamerica. Within the south-eastern component the areas split
   following the sequence south-eastern Amazonia, Chaco, and Parana. The
   three main components are treated as subregions: Antillean, Amazonian
   (northern Amazonian, south-western Amazonian, Mesoamerican, and
   north-western South American dominions), and Chacoan (south-eastern
   Amazonian, Chacoan, and Parana dominions). Dispersal and vicariant
   events postulated to explain these pattens might have occurred during
   the Cretaceous, when the Caribbean plate collided with the Americas, a
   combination of eustatic sea-level changes and tectonic deformations of
   the continental platform exposed large parts of South America to
   episodes of marine transgressions, and the Andean uplift reconfigured
   the Amazonian area. Tertiary and Quaternary events are assumed to have
   later induced the diversification within these large biogeographical
   units.},

Abstract = {Among quantum phenomena in solids at low temperatures, the
   superconductivity and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) are
   representatives of arising from coherent macroscopic quantum states. In
   this article, we discuss possible correlations between these two
   phenomena. It is well known that the Cooper pairs are not true bosons
   and then, we introduce the concept of collective electron pairs (CEP)
   through a unitary transformation of electron pairs. The CEP accomplish
   bosonic commutation relations at the dilute limit, being able to
   accumulate many of them at a single quantum state, in contrast to the
   standard Cooper pairs. An exact solution of all single CEP eigenstates
   is found by means of the Richardson's equation within a multishell
   model. The obtained energy spectrum is used to determine the BEC
   temperature of CEP. In addition, we present an alternative approach to
   calculate the superconducting critical temperature by using the BEC
   formalism for a system composed by ground-state CEP, excited pairs and
   unpaired electrons.},

Title = {Coalescence in wild organisms of the intertidal population of

Abstract = {Lessonia berteroana is the subject of 85 \% of the total harvest of
   Chilean brown seaweeds, representing close to 10 \% of total kelp
   biomass worldwide harvested for alginic acid extraction. Frequent
   incidence of coalescent holdfasts was detected in natural populations,
   and this process gives rise to fused sporophytes. This study presents
   the coalescence events in natural populations in northern Chile. During
   2011, in natural intertidal populations, 435 target sporophytes of
   different sizes were observed weekly and 63.90 \% (278) showed physical
   signs of coalescent disks. We were able to distinguish five fusion modes
   depending on the number and size of each of the participant sporophytes
   and their spatial distribution. There was a progressive decrease of
   density and an increase in the number of stipes of each sporophyte over
   time. Two processes were recognized: active fusion of juvenile
   sporophytes and passive fusion of adult and senescent sporophytes.
   However, most of the coalescence processes were detected in juvenile
   sporophytes with a holdfast diameter of 0.5 to 2 cm. The minimum
   distance between pairs of coalescing sporophytes was 0.5 cm, and the
   maximum distance was 13 cm. For good harvesting practices, it is
   recommended that plants with over 20 cm holdfast diameter are harvested
   from natural populations because over this size, all of the plants have
   reproduced. Coalescence events would produce plants with legal size
   requirement; however, these plant units would not be reproductive,
   affecting the sustainability of this important coastal resource.},

Abstract = {We introduce the monotone Sokolov property and show that it is dual to
   monotone retractability in the sense that X is monotonically retractable
   if and only if C-p(X) is monotonically Sokolov. Besides, a space X is
   monotonically Sokolov if and only if C-p(X) is monotonically
   retractable. Monotone retractability and monotone Sokolov property are
   shown to be preserved by R-quotient images and F-sigma-subspaces.
   Furthermore, every monotonically retractable space is Sokolov so it is
   collectionwise normal and has countable extent. We also establish that
   if X and C-p(X) are Lindelof Sigma-spaces then they are both
   monotonically retractable and have the monotone Sokolov property. An
   example is given of a space X such that C-p(X) has the Lindelof
   Sigma-property but neither X nor C-p(X) is monotonically retractable. We
   also establish that every Lindelof Sigma-space with a unique
   non-isolated point is monotonically retractable. On the other hand, each
   Lindelof space with a unique non-isolated point is monotonically
   Sokolov. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The preferred temperature of Tegula regina was determined in a
   horizontal thermal gradient with organisms acclimated to 16 degrees C,

   temperature of 19.7 +/- 1.8 degrees C for the day cycle and 18.8 +/- 1.2

   determined for marine snails was 19.2 +/- 1.5 degrees C. The
   displacement velocity decreased to an interval from 99.1 cm/h to 62.5
   cm/h. During the third hour, when organisms detected the preferred
   temperature, the velocity diminished gradually from 25.8 cm/h to 7.5
   cm/h. Critical temperature maxima (CTMax), which refers to the
   temperature at which at least 50\% of the experimental group displays a
   loss of attachment, was measured at three acclimation temperatures (16
   degrees C, 19 degrees C, and 22 degrees C). At the acclimation
   temperature (16 degrees C), 50\% of the experimental group had an
   attachment loss at a CTMax of 29.3 degrees C. At a warmer acclimation
   temperature (22 degrees C), the observed CTMax was 31.2 degrees C.
   Marine snail oxygen consumption rate increased significantly (P < 0.05,
   31\%) from 16 degrees C to 22 degrees C.},

Abstract = {The determination of trace element composition of airborne particles
   usually requires dissolution in acidic media followed by Inductively
   Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. Analytical methods
   are usually validated on NIST SRM 1648 and 1648a, but without any
   further discussion regarding their application to real atmospheric
   samples. Here, we present an assessment of 5 digestion methods (over a
   hot plate and using a microwave system) for SRM 1648a and atmospheric
   particles based on the analysis of 30 elements by ICP-MS. Recoveries of
   NIST-certified elements for SRM 1648a confirm that a digestion method
   using HNO3-HF on a hot-plate yields acceptable recoveries for most of
   the NIST-certified elements (with the exception of Cr). By conducting
   the elemental analysis in triplicate samples of particles collected on
   PTFE filters, we determined that the analytical method is reproducible
   within 9\% for real PM samples. Heterogeneity of the reference material
   and atmospheric samples, as well as differences in chemical composition
   and particle size between both, suggests that uncertainties related to
   the dissolution of trace elements using acidic mixtures are not well
   characterized.},

Abstract = {Kelp beds, besides being one of the most important benthic resources in
   northern Chile, provide a variety of environmental goods and services.
   In order to evaluate economically the wild kelp populations in northern
   Chile (26A degrees to 32A degrees S) more than simply their commercial
   value as a source of raw materials for alginate extraction, we used
   several economic indicators to holistically assess the value of a group
   of brown seaweeds of economic importance, Lessonia spp. and Macrocystis
   pyrifera: (1) market value of biomass as a source of raw material for
   extraction of alginic acid, (2) market value of associated species of
   economic importance, (3) value as a source of scientific information,
   (4) value as a climate buffer (CO2 capture and release of O-2), (5)
   value of associated biodiversity (non-commercial species), (6) value as
   cultural heritage and (7) value as a reservoir of biodiversity.
   Existence values of kelp beds which estimate the willingness of citizens
   to pay and work without payment to preserve the ecosystem were
   calculated using the contingent valuation technique. The results
   indicate that kelp beds in northern Chile have a total value of US \$540
   million. Of this total, kelp fishery accounts for 75 \% and
   associated-species fisheries account for 15 \%. In this context, the
   economic value of Chilean kelp beds is mainly associated with the
   industry of alginate extraction. By contrast, existence value as a
   source of scientific information or environmental buffer for CO2 capture
   or O-2 production represents only 9 \% of the total value, representing
   a very low relative importance to society. The economic valuation of
   coastal resources and marine ecosystems is a complementary tool for
   decision making and implementation of public policies related to the
   conservation and sustainable exploitation of renewable resources and
   their ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The present study was carried out to validate the daily deposition and
   age estimation by using beak rostrum sagittal sections increments of
   cultivated Octopus maya (Voss and Solis, 1966). This study validates for
   first time the periodicity of beak increments by using animals of known
   age. We analyzed the rostrum sagittal sections (RSS) of upper and lower
   beaks in 40 juveniles of O. maya divided into four age groups (63, 87,
   105 and 122 days) with 10 individuals per group. The animals were fed
   with a soft diet allowing obtaining age estimations not affected by the
   beak erosion. At the same time 50 animals were sampled every 20 days
   until 120 days old to obtain an age-body wet weight (BW) curve which
   could be compared with the age-BW curve obtained using age estimations
   from beaks. Co-variance analysis showed no statistical differences
   between both curves. The number of increments present in the beaks
   corresponded with the number of days from hatchling. Therefore, it was
   possible to validate that a growth increment corresponds to a day of
   life in O. maya, confirming that, up to 122 days old, the beaks counts
   can be used to determine the age of O. maya. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A biogeographic regionalisation of the Neotropical region is proposed as
   a hierarchical classification of sub-regions, dominions, provinces and
   districts. This regionalisation is based on biogeographic analyses of
   terrestrial plant and animal taxa, and seeks to provide universality,
   objectivity and stability, such that it can be applied when describing
   distributional areas of particular taxa or comparing different
   biogeographic analyses. The Neotropical region is currently comprised of
   three sub-regions (Antillean, Brazilian and Chacoan), two transition
   zones (Mexican and South American), seven dominions (Mesoamerican,
   Pacific, Boreal Brazilian, Southwestern Amazonian, Southeastern
   Amazonian, Chacoan and Parana) and 53 provinces. For some of the latter,
   sub-provinces and districts are recognized. Complete synonymies and
   brief descriptions of the areas are provided, as well as the endemic
   taxa that diagnose the different provinces.},

Abstract = {The advantages of FLOC over clear water (CW) in rearing juvenile
   Litopenaeus vannamei and its effects on Vibrio communities were
   evaluated. Survival rate in FLOC and clear water was recorded and a
   probiotic was tested under both conditions. Daily growth rate (DGR) was
   higher in FLOC (p < 0.05) than in CW. Survival in each system increased
   significantly when a probiotic was included in the diet (p < 0.05). The
   Vibrionaceae community from the hepatopancreas (HP) and the culture
   medium did not differ between the two culture media. Nevertheless, a
   novel group of Vibrio strains was found to be unique to FLOC. No high
   level of lesions was observed in shrimp tissues from the FLOC +
   probiotic treatment; it suggests that the probiotic contributed to
   homeostasis and prevented outbreak of opportunistic pathogenic species.

Title = {Key aspects of egg incubation in Patagonian red octopus (Enteroctopus
   megalocyathus) for cultivation purposes},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {424},
Pages = {158-166},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Patagonian red octopus, Enteroctopus megalotyathus, is a valuable
   resource of the artisanal fishery in southern Chile, however, clue to
   overfishing the E. megalocyathus fishery was banned for 3 years in
   Chile, therefore its cultivation became a target for the Chilean
   aquaculture. The rearing of octopus paralarvae is currently the biggest
   bottleneck for the aquaculture of merobenthic octopus species. Besides,
   the embryos of Patagonian red octopus require 5 months for embryonic
   development, a very long period of incubation that involves high risks
   of contamination and detachment, therefore, little advance has been
   achieved in the larviculture of this species. This study represents the
   first investigation to evaluate the embryo viability, embryo
   morphometrics, embryo growth and the biochemical composition and fatty
   acid dynamics during early development of Patagonian red octopus under
   captive reproduction. The eggs obtained from broodstock conditioning
   were incubated under maternal care and the embryos were studied until
   hatching in their main morphometric and biochemical features during
   development. Most females showed a tending behavior of the eggs along
   the incubation period, losing between 40 and 100\% of the eggs in the
   first 3 months of incubation, The results of incubation at 11 degrees C
   were successful observing the complete gastrulation, onset of
   organogenesis and first inversion about 48 days after spawning, the
   complete organogenesis and second reversion were observed about 152 days
   after spawning, hatching was observed 168 days after spawning without
   any external yolk-sac on the hatched paralarvae. During their
   development, embryos showed an exponential growth rate in length and
   weight, fueled by the protein and lipids of external yolk-sac.
   Metabolism of lipids showed over a 70\% depletion of the saturated fatty
   acids (SEA), and the fatty acids 16:1, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3 and 22:5n-3
   during development. The DHA/EPA ratio remained constant throughout the
   incubation period. The early embryos showed a fatty acid profile
   dominated by both SEA and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUEA), while
   the newly hatched paralarvae showed a profile dominated by HUEA. (C)

Abstract = {Diverse steroidal compounds have shown antiproliferative activity on
   certain tumor cell lines; however, their complete role on cancer cells
   has not been extensively established since the research is quite recent.
   Hence, deeper study in this field is required. Due to the importance of
   selenium in animal and human health; herein, we report the synthesis,
   characterization, and biological evaluation of two novel
   22-oxo-26-selenocyanocholestanic steroids on cervicouterine cancer cells
   and non-tumor cells. The title compounds were straightforward prepared
   from diosgenin and hecogenin in excellent overall yields. We determined
   their effect on cell proliferation on HeLa, CaSki, and ViBo cell
   cultures. Their cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, as well as on
   peripheral blood lymphocytes was also evaluated. The increase in the
   expression of active caspase-3 along with the fragmentation of DNA
   confirm that the new 22-oxo-26selenocyanocholestane frameworks
   potentiate apoptosis in tumor cells. The antiproliferative activity on
   tumor cells affects to some extent the proliferative potential of
   peripheral blood lymphocytes, so an immunosuppressive effect has also
   been established. The novel 22-oxo-26-selenocyanocholestane compounds
   show selective antitumor activity and therefore are promising lead
   candidates for further in vivo evaluation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Title = {Structure of the Female Gonoduct of the Viviparous Teleost Poecilia

Abstract = {Female teleosts do not have oviducts because Mullerian ducts do not
   develop. Instead, the caudal region of the ovary, the gonoduct, connects
   to the exterior. Because of the lack of oviducts in viviparous teleosts,
   the embryos develop in the ovary, as an intraovarian gestation, unique
   in vertebrates. This is the first study to address the histology of the
   gonoduct in a viviparous teleost. The gonoduct of Poecilia reticulata
   was analyzed during previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis, and gestation.
   The gonoduct lacks germinal cells. From deep to superficial, the wall
   has simple cuboidal or columnar epithelium, loose connective tissue,
   longitudinal layer of smooth muscle, and visceral peritoneum. Cells of
   the immune system occur in the lumen and in the mucosa. The gonoduct was
   divided in three regions: 1) cephalic, 2) middle, and 3) caudal. At the
   initial part of each region, thin mucosal folds extend into the lumen.
   The cephalic region forms a tubular structure with light and irregular
   folds. The middle region has a wider lumen and is more irregular due to
   ventral invaginations and irregular and short mucosal folds; beneath the
   epithelium there are melano-macrophage centers. The caudal region is
   delimited from the middle region by folds; however, they are thinner
   than these of the other regions. Ventral invaginations form exocrine
   glands, and the smooth muscle is thicker than in the other regions.
   During gestation, cells of the immune system are abundant;
   melano-macrophage centers become larger and the glands exhibit
   desquamated cells. These observations suggest roles of the gonoduct in
   reducing the diameter of the lumen; receiving sperm during
   vitellogenesis; producing secretions, more abundant during
   vitellogenesis; and in immunological activity throughout the
   reproductive cycle. The ciliated epithelium and the thick muscle of the
   caudal region may be involved during birth. J. Morphol. 275:247-257,

Abstract = {Seasonality in tropical dry forest shows extreme changes in the
   physiognomy of forest as well the available resources in each season,
   thus, the composition and diversity of fauna inhabiting in that
   ecosystem show seasonal variations in answer to that changes. The ants
   constitute a very important element in the canopies of tropical forests,
   and there is few information about their communities in dry forest. In
   most of ecosystems, the general patterns of ant distribution show
   increase of their abundance during the wet season, but according with
   the characteristics of Chamela tropical dry forest in the Pacific Cost
   of Mexico, the great amount of epiphytes in the area can be an important
   resource to the ants, and the canopy can be an environment visited for
   different species of ants during the driest month. In order to study the
   seasonal variations in species richness, composition and diversity of
   ant canopy community in a tropical deciduous forest, seven fogging were
   performed in a watershed of the Chamela Biological Station, Jalisco
   State, Mexico, including dry and rainy season. A total of 5 563 ant
   specimens were collected belong to 46 morphospecies from 17 genera. The
   most species richness genera were Camponotus and Cephalotes, with 13 and
   6 species respectively, and the most abundant ants were species of
   Crematogaster, Tapinoma, Cephalotes and Camponotus genera. Nevertheless
   dominant species were present during all the study, abundance show a
   great seasonality, with highest values during the dry season. The
   dominant guild in the canopy was the omnivorous in all study, but
   differences in guild trophic composition were recorded in each fogging.
   The ant community in the canopy of Chamela shows important seasonal
   variations in the composition and trophic guilds dominance, due
   conditions of this forest, that differences can be result of variations
   in the exploitation of resources along the year, and vertical migrations
   of ant species from soil and shrub layer to canopy in the tropical
   deciduous forest.},

Abstract = {Bayesian posterior probabilities are wrongly considered by many
   systematists as indicative of character support, and equivalent to
   non-parametric bootstrap frequencies. Here I argue against this view.
   Non-parametric bootstrap is indicative of the amount of evidence in a
   data matrix supporting each clade in the tree, while Bayesian posterior
   probabilities are not intended to represent that property. Clades with
   high posterior probability may not have a large amount of characters
   favouring them, and their frequencies are the result of the particular
   sampling procedure of the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method,
   which tends to sample very similar topologies according to their
   posterior probabilities. Both metrics may relate to the notion of
   confidence, but depict different properties.},

Title = {The Ultrastructure of Spermatid Development During Spermiogenesis Within

Abstract = {Several recent studies have mapped out the characters of spermiogenesis
   within several species of squamates. Many of these data have shown both
   conserved and possibly apomorphic morphological traits that could be
   important in future phylogenetic analysis within Reptilia. There,
   however, has not been a recent study that compares spermiogenesis and
   its similarities or differences between two species of reptile that
   reside in the same genus. Thus, the present analysis details the changes
   to spermiogenesis in Sceloporus variabilis and then compares spermatid
   morphologies to that of Sceloporus bicanthalis. Many of the
   morphological changes that the spermatids undergo in these two species
   are similar or conserved, which is similar to what has been reported in
   other squamates. There are six main character differences that can be
   observed during the development of the spermatids between these two
   sceloporid lizards. They include the presence (S. variabilis) or absence
   (S. bicanthalis) of a mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum complex near
   the Golgi apparatus during acrosome development, a shallow (S.
   variabilis) or deep (S. bicanthalis) nuclear indentation that
   accommodates the acrosomal vesicle, filamentous (S. variabilis) or
   granular (S. bicanthalis) chromatin condensation, no spiraling (S.
   variabilis) or spiraling (S. bicanthalis) of chromatin during
   condensation, absence (S. variabilis) or presence (S. bicanthalis) of
   the longitudinal manchette microtubules, and the lack of (S. variabilis)
   or presence (S. bicanthalis) of nuclear lacunae. This is the first study
   that compares spermiogenic ultrastructural characters between species
   within the same genus. The significance of the six character differences
   between two distantly related species within Sceloporus is still
   unknown, but these data do suggest that spermiogenesis might be a good
   model to study the hypothesis that spermatid ontogeny is species
   specific. J. Morphol. 275:258-268, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,
