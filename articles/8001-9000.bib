Abstract = {Gomphus calakmulensis, G. albidocarneus and G. pleurobrunnescens are
   proposed and described as new species from the Mexican states of
   Campeche and Chiapas, while G. pallidus, previously recorded only in the
   eastern U.S. and Japan, has now been found in various parts of Mexico
   for the first time. This work describes the species, illustrates their
   key features, discusses their distribution, as well as their
   similarities and differences, and provides an identification key for all
   of them. All of the specimens studied here come from tropical or
   subtropical ecosystems.},

Title = {Evaluating the Farming/Language Dispersal Hypothesis with genetic
   variation exhibited by populations in the Southwest and Mesoamerica},

Abstract = {The Farming/Language Dispersal Hypothesis posits that prehistoric
   population expansions, precipitated by the innovation or early adoption
   of agriculture, played an important role in the uneven distribution of
   language families recorded across the world. In this case, the most
   widely spread language families today came to be distributed at the
   expense of those that have more restricted distributions. In the
   Americas, Uto-Aztecan is one such language family that may have been
   spread across Mesoamerica and the American Southwest by ancient farmers.
   We evaluated this hypothesis with a large-scale study of mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosomal DNA variation in indigenous populations
   from these regions. Partial correlation coefficients, determined with
   Mantel tests, show that Y-chromosome variation in indigenous populations
   from the American Southwest and Mesoamerica correlates significantly
   with linguistic distances (r = 0.33-0.384; P < 0.02), whereas mtDNA
   diversity correlates significantly with only geographic distance (r =
   0.619; P = 0.002). The lack of correlation between mtDNA and
   Y-chromosome diversity is consistent with differing population histories
   of males and females in these regions. Although unlikely, if groups of
   Uto-Aztecan speakers were responsible for the northward spread of
   agriculture and their languages from Mesoamerica to the Southwest, this
   migration was possibly biased to males. However, a recent in situ
   population expansion within the American Southwest (2,105 years before
   present; 99.5\% confidence interval = 1,273-3,773 YBP), one that
   probably followed the introduction and intensification of maize
   agriculture in the region, may have blurred ancient mtDNA patterns,
   which might otherwise have revealed a closer genetic relationship
   between females in the Southwest and Mesoamerica.},

Abstract = {The geographical distributions of 2 species of Agrodes and 13 species of
   Plochionocerus were analyzed using a panbiogeographic approach to
   identify their biogeographic patterns. Nine species have been recorded
   as being exclusively from South America, 2 exclusively from Central
   America, and 4 are shared between both areas. Two species of Agrodes and
   3 of Plochionocerus are widely distributed in 2 or more subregions of
   the Neotropical region, and 6 species of Plochionocerus have more
   restricted distributions, basically ranging in a single subregion, and 4
   species are restricted to a small number of localities. Three
   generalized tracks were identified in the Mesoamerican dominion of the
   Caribbean subregion, in the northwestern South American dominion of the
   Caribbean subregion, and in the Amazonian subregion. Species of other
   staphylinid genera provide additional support to these tracks.},

Abstract = {Prokaryotic genomes of endosymbionts and parasites are examples of
   naturally evolved minimal cells, the study of which can shed light on
   life in its minimum form. Their diverse biology, their lack of a large
   set of orthologous genes and the existence of essential linage (and
   environmentally) specific genes all illustrate the diversity of genes
   building up naturally evolved minimal cells. This conclusion is
   reinforced by the fact that sometimes the same essential function is
   performed by genes from different evolutionary origins. Nevertheless,
   all cells perform a set of life-essential functions however different
   their cell machinery and environment in which they thrive. An upcoming
   challenge for biologists will be to discern, by studying differences and
   similarities in current biodiversity, how cells with reduced genomes
   have adapted while retaining all basic life-supporting functions.},

Volume = {18},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The effects of two alternative prey (crayfish and hake) were tested on
   growth and survival of both juveniles and adults of Octopus vulgaris in
   two experiments. Octopuses fed the control (squid) were larger (3.0 +/-
   A 0.7 kg) than those fed crayfish (2.4 +/- A 0.6 kg) at the end of
   experiment I. Similarly, overall growth rates were higher for octopuses
   fed squid (1.7 +/- A 0.3 and 1.2 +/- A 0.2 \%BW day(-1), respectively).
   Average feeding rates for the experiment were not different, being 6.5
   +/- A 0.9 and 7.5 +/- A 0.9 \%BW day(-1), respectively, for octopuses
   fed either squid or crayfish. Nevertheless, food conversions for the
   experiment were higher (42.4 +/- A 2.7\%) for octopuses fed squid
   compared to the ones fed crayfish (23.9 +/- A 1.9 g). For experiment II,
   hake and crayfish were compared to squid; the final weight of octopuses
   fed squid, hake or crayfish was 1,183.0 +/- A 242.7 g, 1,175.6 +/- A
   240.1 g and 922.3 +/- A 160.1 g, respectively. Overall growth rates for
   the experiment were 1.9 +/- A 0.2 \%BW day(-1), 1.9 +/- A 0.3 \%BW
   day(-1) and 1.1 +/- A 0.3 g, respectively. Final weight and growth rates
   were never different (P > 0.05) between octopuses fed squid and hake,
   but were always higher (P < 0.05) compared to the ones fed crayfish.
   Average feeding rates for experiment II were similar for the three
   diets, and of 4.6 +/- A 1.5, 4.2 +/- A 1.3 \%BW day(-1) and 5.1 +/- A
   0.9 \%BW day(-1), respectively, for octopuses fed squid, hake or
   crayfish. Food conversions for experiment II were of 41.0 +/- A 9.6\%,
   40.5 +/- A 9.9\% and 21.3 +/- A 7.4 g, respectively, for octopuses fed
   squid, hake or crayfish, and were always higher for octopuses fed squid
   and hake compared to crayfish. The results indicate that crayfish is not
   an adequate replacement for the usual prey to fatten octopus, even
   considering its much lower market price.},

Abstract = {The processes of cell death were studied in vitro in populations of
   oocytes isolated from prepubertal rats. In order to identify apoptosis,
   the externalized phosphatidylserine was recognized with Annexin-V
   coupled to FITC and the fragmentation of DNA was demonstrated by means
   of electrophoresis. Oocytes were tested for autophagy by means of the
   incorporation of monodansylcadaverine and monitoring Lc3-I/Lc3-II by
   western blot. The expression of mRNA marker genes of autophagy and of
   apoptosis was studied by means of RT-PCR in pure populations of oocytes.
   Some oocytes expressed at least one of the following markers: caspase-3,
   lamp1 and Lc3. Some oocytes were positive to Annexin-V or to
   monodansylcadaverine. However, most of them were simultaneously positive
   to both markers. The relative frequency of oocytes simultaneously
   positive to markers of apoptosis and autophagy did not change in the
   different ages studied. The transformation of Lc3-I in Lc3-II was
   present in all populations of oocytes studied. The mRNAs for caspase-3,
   lamp1 and Lc3 were present in all populations of oocytes analyzed. Our
   results demonstrate that oocytes of rats from new born to prepubertal
   age are eliminated by means of three different cell death processes:
   apoptosis, autophagy and a mixed event in which both routes to cell
   death participate in the same cell.},

Abstract = {Certain steroidal compounds have demonstrated an antiproliferative
   effect against several tumor cell lines; however, their complete role on
   cancer cells is not currently established. Herein, we report the
   synthesis and evaluation of two new 26-hydroxy-22-oxocholestanic
   steroids on cervical cancer CaSki cells. The title compounds were
   prepared from diosgenin and hecogenin in excellent yields. We determined
   their effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death. The
   cytotoxic effect of the title compounds on CaSki and human lymphocytes
   was also evaluated, indicating that the main cell death process is not
   necrosis; the null effect on lymphocytes implies that they are not
   cytotoxic. The observation of apoptotic bodies as well as the increase
   in the expression of active caspase-3 along with the fragmentation of
   DNA confirmed that such new cholestanic frameworks induced apoptosis in
   tumor cells. Significantly, their antiproliferative activity on tumor
   cells did not affect the proliferative potential of normal fibroblasts
   from cervix and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The title compounds show
   selective antitumor activity and therefore serve as promising lead
   candidates for further optimization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Fundamental biogeographic patterns across the Mexican Transition Zone:
   an evolutionary approach},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {355-361},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transition zones, located at the boundaries between biogeographic
   regions, represent events of biotic hybridization, promoted by
   historical and ecological changes. They deserve special attention,
   because they represent areas of intense biotic interaction. In its more
   general sense, the Mexican Transition Zone is a complex and varied area
   where Neotropical and Nearctic biotas overlap, from southwestern USA to
   Mexico and part of Central America, extending south to the Nicaraguan
   lowlands. In recent years, panbiogeographic analyses have led to
   restriction of the Mexican Transition Zone to the montane areas of
   Mexico and to recognize five smaller biotic components within it. A
   cladistic biogeographic analysis challenged the hypothesis that this
   transition zone is biogeographically divided along a north-south axis at
   the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, as the two major clades found divided
   Mexico in an east-west axis. This implies that early Tertiary geological
   events leading to the convergence of Neotropical and Nearctic elements
   may be younger (Miocene) than those that led to the east-west pattern
   (Paleocene). The Mexican Transition Zone consists of five biogeographic
   provinces: Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican
   Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur, and Chiapas. Within this transition
   zone, at least four cenocrons have been identified: Paleoamerican,
   Nearctic, Montane Mesoamerican, and Tropical Mesoamerican. Future
   studies should continue refining the identification of cenocrons and the
   reconstruction of a geobiotic scenario, as well as integrating
   ecological biogeographic studies, to allow a more complete understanding
   of the patterns and processes that have caused the biotic complexity of
   this transition zone.},

Abstract = {Globally, octopus larviculture is one of the challenges faced in the
   attempt to diversify aquaculture and achieve cephalopod farming.
   Currently, only juveniles of Octopus vulgaris, Octopus joubini, and
   Enteroctopus dofleini have been obtained at an experimental level. This
   is the first study to look at the characteristics of planktonic and
   benthic Robsonella fontaniana juveniles in an effort to analyze the
   morphometric changes occurring during their planktonic and benthic
   phases and to explore the feasibility of obtaining settlement under
   controlled conditions. The morphometric measurements varied
   exponentially over time and did not show different tendencies before and
   after settlement. Mantle growth in relation to total length fit a
   logarithmic regression, whereas arm length and eye diameter increased
   linearly with respect to total length throughout the entire paralarval
   and juvenile periods. This suggests that the size of the mantle
   decreases with age in proportion to the total octopus length, whereas
   the organs more directly involved in catching prey tend to increase in
   direct proportion to the total length. The present study shows that R.
   fontaniana can be reared from hatching through the final paralarval
   stage on a diet of Lithodes santolla (king crab) zoeae; after
   settlement, the juveniles can be reared on a diet of crab such as
   Petrolisthes.},

Abstract = {We evaluated invertebrates, with an emphasis on Collembola, as
   bioindicators of soil quality in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils in
   southeastern Mexico. We carried out 2 sampling periods in summer-fall of
   2004 in 4 parcels of 2 hectares each. From each parcel we processed 8
   samples using the Berlese-Tullgren funnel technique and 4 using the
   flotation method. For Collembola we calculated the following ecological
   indices: abundance, richness, the Shannon index (H'), dominance
   (lambda), equitativity (J') and the similarity index (S). We also
   performed the following soil analyses: total petroleum hydrocarbon
   content (HTP), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content (HAP), porosity,
   pH, CE, MO, N, P, K, CIC, and texture. In contaminated areas, HTP
   exceeded the safe limits sets by Mexican environmental legislation. In
   all studied areas we observed Collembola, mites, and dipteran larvae.
   The variation in abundance and diversity of these insects can be used as
   biondicators of the level of contamination and quality of the soil. We
   found very low abundances of Crustacea, Formicidae, Aranae, Diptera,
   Pseudoscopionida, and Diplopoda. The Collembola families that were most
   widely distributed were Sminthurididae and Isotomidae. Our correlation
   analysis showed that their diversity is affected by HAP level
   (fluoranthene, naphthalene, pyrene, chrysene and phenanthrene).},

Title = {The South American Biogeographic Transition Zone: An analysis from
   Asteraceae},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {505-509},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In order to elucidate the biotic diversification of Asteraceae
   inhabiting the South American Transition Zone, we undertook a
   panbiogeographic analysis (based on a parsimony analysis of endemicity)
   and a cladistic biogeographic analysis. The study units were the six
   biogeographic provinces of this zone plus the seven subregions of the
   Neotropical and Andean regions, considered as ``outgroups{''}. Species
   analyzed belonged to the genera Arnaldoa, Barnadesia, Belloa, Berroa,
   Chevreulia, Chuquiraga, Cuatrecasiella, Dasyphyllum, Doniophyton,
   Duseniella, Facellis, Fulcaldea, Gamochaetopsis, Huarpea, Hypochaeris,
   Jalcophila, Luciliocline, and Schlechtendalia. A parsimony analysis of
   endemicity, based on presence/absence data of the 66 individual tracks
   ranged on two or more areas, allowed to identify four generalized
   tracks: (1) Coastal Peruvian Desert and Puna provinces; (2) Central
   Chilean, Patagonian, and Subantarctic subregions; (3) Amazonian,
   Chacoan, and Parana subregions; and (4) Puna province and Parana and
   Chacoan subregions. The Puna and Parana provinces, connected with two
   different generalized tracks each, constitute nodes. A cladistic
   biogeographic analysis, based on the paralogy-free subtrees extracted
   from the taxonomic area cladograms of Barnadesia, Chuquiraga,
   Dasyphyllum, Hypochaeris, and the Lucilia group, allowed obtaining a
   general area cladogram, which indicates a basic separation between the
   Atacama, Monte, and Prepuna provinces closely related to the Andean
   region, and the North Andean Paramo, Coastal Peruvian Desert, and Puna
   provinces closely related to the Neotropical region. Our results
   corroborate once again the transitional character of the provinces
   assigned to the South American Transition Zone, and allow speculating on
   their close affinities with the Andean and Neotropical regions.},

Title = {Temporal and spatial distribution of macroalgal communities of mountain
   streams in Valle de Bravo Basin, central Mexico},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {641},
Number = {1},
Pages = {159-169},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The stream macroalgal community is controlled by heterogeneous physical,
   chemical, and biological factors related with multiple spatial and
   temporal scales; however, the mechanisms that explain diversity and
   distribution are scarcely known. The present investigation was conducted
   to characterize the macroalgal community structure and spatial and
   temporal distribution and to recognize biogeographic affinities with
   mountain streams from other regions. Habitat characteristics, abundance,
   and diversity were investigated in four mountain streams of Valle de
   Bravo Basin, central Mexico, during two annual cycles. Sampling of
   visible benthic growths was collected in the most contrasting parts of
   the year. Physicochemical parameters were recorded in situ at each site
   and the main ions and nutriments were evaluated for every collection.
   Statistical analysis between dates was assessed with one-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Observed
   richness average was four species per site and the high abundance of
   Phormidium interruptum, Nostoc parmelioides, Paralemanea mexicana,
   Batrachospermum gelatinosum, Sirodotia suecica, Cladophora glomerata,
   and Prasiola mexicana correlated with cold dry season, high current
   velocity, and a major size substrate. Valle de Bravo streams can be
   viewed as a habitat subjected to moderated disturbance, mainly due to
   the effects of seasonal changes in rainfall contrary to torrents
   expected of tropical regions. The seasonal patterns of macroalgal
   communities in Valle de Bravo basin were typically characterized by two
   distinct periods essentially determined by the rainfall regime and
   related to temperature, and can be viewed as habitats subjected to
   moderate disturbance according to intermediate disturbance hypothesis.
   The distribution species pattern registered suggests a group of
   temperate species frequently found in mountain regions of the Mexican
   Volcanic Belt and temperate eastern region of North America and may
   indicate a possible biogeographic connection with the Neartic region
   with similar environmental requirements.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships were studied in the genus Cyanocorax (Aves:
   Corvidae) and related genera, Psilorhinus and Calocitta, a diverse group
   of New World jays distributed from the Southern United States South to
   Argentina. Although the ecology and behavior of some species ill the
   group have been Studied extensively, lack of a molecular phylogeny has
   precluded rigorous interpretations in all evolutionary framework. Given
   the diverse combinations of plumage coloration, size, and morphology,
   the taxonomy of the group has been inconsistent and understanding of
   biogeographic patterns problematic. Moreover, plumage similarity between
   two geographically disjuct species, the Tufted jay (Cyanocorax dickeyi)
   from western Mexico and the White-tailed jay (C. mystacalis) from
   western Ecuador and Peru, has puzzled ornithologists for decades. Here,
   a phylogeny of all species in the three genera is presented, based on
   study of two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Phylogenetic trees
   revealed the non-monophyly of Cyanocorax, and the division of the whole
   assemblage ill two groups: ``Clade A{''} containing Psilorhinus morio,
   both species in Calocitta, Cyanocorax violaceus, C caeruleus, C
   cristatellus, and C. cyanomelas, and ``Clade B{''} consisting of the
   remaining species in Cyanocorax. Relationships among species in Clade A
   were ambiguous and, in general, not well resolved. Within Clade B,
   analyses revealed the monophyly of the ``Cissilopho{''} jays and showed
   no evidence for a sister relationship between C mystacalis and C
   dickeyi. The phylogenetic complexity of lineages in the group suggests
   several complications for the understanding biogeographic patterns, as
   well as for proposing a taxonomy that is consistent with morphological
   variation. Although multiple taxonomic arrangements are possible,
   recommendations are for recognizing only one genus, Cyanocorax, with
   Psilorhinus and Calocitta as synonyms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Coralline red algae assimilate HCO3 to precipitate CaCO3 in their
   tissues in the form of calcite or aragonite. A characterization of the
   biomolecular content and the crystalline structure of the biomineral of
   coralline red algae from the Pacific coast of Mexico was performed by
   powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron (SEM) and tunneling
   microscopy (STM). and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Fritz).
   The preliminary conclusion drawn from the results is that this type of
   calcite-aragonite biomineral has a very low organic content occluded
   within the crystals. FTIR bands at 2945 and 2889 cm(-1) indicate that
   the most likely organic molecules are carbohydrates: moreover. peptide
   bond bands (amide I similar to 1640 and amide II similar to 1540 cm(-1))
   were not detected, suggesting that proteins are not related to mineral
   synthesis or their stabilization. This could be explained if the
   biomineral is synthesized by a biologically controlled extracellular
   mineralization process. The XRD study showed two main mineral phases,
   calcite and aragonite, with very similar structural parameters to the
   inorganic mineral counterparts. The crystallite shapes, seen by STM.
   were found as plates and needles with different sizes, between 20 and
   100 nm.},

Title = {Neither testosterone levels nor aggression decrease when the male
   Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) displays paternal
   behavior},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The first studies that correlated mammalian paternal behavior and
   testosterone levels indicated that the concentration of this steroid
   hormone decreases when males exhibit paternal care. However, recent
   studies have also shown that testosterone levels do not decrease when
   males display paternal behavior. In this study, we measured testosterone
   levels in plasma throughout the reproductive cycle of the Mongolian
   gerbil. Testosterone concentrations were correlated with paternal care
   as well as aggression. We also examined whether there is a trade-off
   between paternal behavior and aggression in this mammal. Our results
   show that Mongolian gerbil testosterone levels do not decrease when the
   males give paternal care. Likewise, male Mongolian gerbils exhibit high
   levels of aggression while displaying paternal behavior, indicating that
   there is no trade-off between aggression and paternal behavior. More
   studies are needed to determine whether testosterone is involved in the
   regulation of paternal behavior in this rodent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Thirteen Teotihuacan-style ornaments of an incense burner were studied.
   Ceramic pastes, pigments and mica were analyzed by neutron activation,
   X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Elemental (Sc, Cr,
   Fe, Co, Rb, Cs, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb, Lu, Hf, Th and U) and
   statistical analyses of ceramic-body data showed that these pieces were
   made from the same raw material, which is chemically different from the
   fine orange ceramic of Teotihuacan. Montmorillonite and the classical
   components of sand were the minerals identified in the ceramic pastes.
   The white pigment contained calcium, titanium and aluminium, the yellow
   pigment was ocher, and the red pigment was a mixture of red ocher and
   cinnabar, the binder of the pigments being clay. Exoskeletons of diatoms
   and locust ootecs were found in the pigments. Mica was identified as
   biotite, identical with that coming from Monte Alban Oaxaca. We wish to
   undertake a historical reconstrution of these ornaments based on
   archaeometric and literature data.},

Abstract = {We tested the effects of hybridization and introgression on the levels
   of leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in a hybrid zone between Quercus
   magnoliifolia and Quercus resinosa at the Tequila volcano, Jalisco
   state, Mexico, in which the species are distributed along an altitudinal
   gradient ranging from 1400 to 2100 m. Bayesian clustering analysis was
   performed with STRUCTURE on data for eight nuclear microsatellite loci
   to assign individuals from reference populations and from the hybrid
   zone to pure or hybrid genotypic classes. To test the performance of the
   assignment procedure and to determine optimal thresholds for genetic
   assignment pure, hybrid and backcrossed genotypes were simulated (from
   the allelic frequencies found in real pure populations of the two
   species) and reanalyzed with STRUCTURE. Leaf FA and morphological
   identification of parental and hybrid individuals were obtained using
   geometric morphometric techniques. We found genetic and morphological
   evidence of a hybrid zone by secondary contact at the Tequila volcano.
   The genotypes and phenotypes were significantly correlated with altitude
   along the mountain, but no correlation between them was found. FA was
   higher in F-1 hybrids and backcrossed genotypes than in pure species.
   Levels of FA were more correlated with the proportion of genetic
   ancestry of each individual than with leaf morphology or altitude,
   supporting the hypothesis that hybridization is associated with
   development instability potentially caused by disruption of coadapted
   gene complexes characteristic of each species.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a parallel implementation based on insight
   segmentation and registration toolkit for a multiscale feature
   extraction and region growing algorithm, applied to retinal blood
   vessels segmentation. This implementation is capable of achieving an
   accuracy (Ac) comparable to its serial counterpart ( about 92\%), but 8
   to 10 times faster. In this paper, the Ac of this parallel
   implementation is evaluated by comparison with expert manual
   segmentation ( obtained from public databases). On the other hand, its
   performance is compared with previous published serial implementations.
   Both these characteristics make this parallel implementation feasible
   for the analysis of a larger amount of high-resolution retinal images,
   achieving a faster and high-quality segmentation of retinal blood
   vessels.},

Abstract = {Based on Newton's laws reformulated in the Hamiltonian dynamics combined
   with statistical mechanics, we formulate a statistical mechanical theory
   supporting the hypothesis of a closed universe oscillating in
   phase-space. We find that the behavior of this universe as a whole can
   be represented by a free entropic oscillator whose lifespan is
   nonhomogeneous, thus implying that time is shorter or longer according
   to the state of this universe given through its entropy. We conclude
   that time reduces to the entropy production of this universe and that a
   nonzero entropy production means that local fluctuations could exist
   giving rise to the appearance of masses and to the curvature of the
   space.},

Abstract = {The taxonomy and distribution of Nathalis (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) in
   Colombia. In Colombia, Nathalis has two described species: N. iole and
   N. plauta. Previous authors did not make detailed descriptions of its
   distribution in meridional regions and failed to differentiate both
   species based on genitalic characters. Some wing marks have been enough
   to separate them, but co-specificity was a possibility. They inhabit
   Colombia above 2000 m in the paramo, and have a vicariant distribution
   from the remaining population of N. tole in the Antillean and Central
   and North America. An analysis focused on male and female genitalia, as
   well as the wing pattern of more than 100 specimens from the Colombian
   Andes (Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Sierra de Perija) and Mexico,
   indicates that the two species differ in their genitalia, and
   considering their allopatric distribution, we support the specific
   distinction of N. tole and N. plauta. We describe a new endemic
   subspecies found exclusively in the paramo above 3000 in, an area where
   other endemics occur. It has phenotypic plasticity related to
   environmental factors. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58(1): 273-285. Epub 2010 March

Pages = {801-809},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Catalytic removal of pollutants in dry combustion gases in a planar
   stagnation-point flow over a platinum foil is studied using both
   numerical and analytical tools. The governing equations have been
   numerically integrated with the Newton technique, and the response curve
   has been obtained as functions of temperature and the mixture
   concentrations. Using the appropriate stoichiometry, the additional
   oxygen needed to reduce the NO and to achieve complete oxidation of CO
   has been obtained. The asymptotic analysis leads to an algebraic
   equation for the surface covet-age of empty sites as a function of two
   nondimensional parameters: the mass transfer number, relating the
   residence time to the chemical time (sort of Damkohler number), and a
   parameter, which relates the desorption rate to the adsorption rate of
   carbon monoxide and depends strongly on temperature. Critical conditions
   of ignition (light-off) and extinction are identified and closed form
   solutions are obtained for these phenomena. (C) 2009 American Institute

Abstract = {We evaluated changes in gene expression of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp
   in response to a change in diet by comparing specimens which were fed
   with an animal protein diet against those which underwent a change from
   an animal protein diet to a plant protein diet. In addition, we also
   compared specimens which were fed with a plant protein diet with another
   group which underwent a change from plant to animal protein diet.
   Results showed that, in the case of hepatopancreas tissue, a total of
   six genes were differentially expressed and exhibited a high degree of
   homology with sequences which codify for proteins related to metabolism,
   transcription regulation, and rRNA subunits. In the case of muscle
   tissue, four differentially expressed sequences were recorded which
   codified for proteins associated to the immune system response, as well
   as cell structure and signaling. By means of RT-PCR, we also detected
   differentially expressed chitinase transcripts (Delta Ct). We observed
   Delta Ct expression values of 0.49 when comparing specimens fed a plant
   diet to those which underwent a change from plant to an animal diet,
   while a Delta Ct value of 0.52 was observed when comparing animals fed
   with an animal diet to specimens which underwent a change from an animal
   to a plant protein diet Differential gene expression was not observed in
   specimens which did not undergo a change in diet during the experiment.

Title = {Positive selection of a duplicated UV-sensitive visual pigment coincides

Abstract = {The butterfly Heliconius erato can see from the UV to the red part of
   the light spectrum with color vision proven from 440 to 640 nm. Its eye
   is known to contain three visual pigments, rhodopsins, produced by an
   11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal chromophore together with long wavelength
   (LWRh), blue (BRh) and UV (UVRh1) opsins. We now find that H. erato has
   a second UV opsin mRNA (UVRh2)-a previously undescribed duplication of
   this gene among Lepidoptera. To investigate its evolutionary origin, we
   screened eye cDNAs from 14 butterfly species in the subfamily
   Heliconiinae and found both copies only among Heliconius.
   Phylogeny-based tests of selection indicate positive selection of UVRh2
   following duplication, and some of the positively selected sites
   correspond to vertebrate visual pigment spectral tuning residues.
   Epi-microspectrophotometry reveals two UV-absorbing rhodopsins in the H.
   erato eye with lambda(max) = 355 nm and 398 nm. Along with the
   additional UV opsin, Heliconius have also evolved
   3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK)-based yellow wing pigments not found in
   close relatives. Visual models of how butterflies perceive wing color
   variation indicate this has resulted in an expansion of the number of
   distinguishable yellow colors on Heliconius wings. Functional
   diversification of the UV-sensitive visual pigments may help explain why
   the yellow wing pigments of Heliconius are so colorful in the UV range
   compared to the yellow pigments of close relatives lacking the UV opsin
   duplicate.},

   three-sphere: Unitarity and uniqueness},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {81},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {We study the Fock description of a quantum free field on the
   three-sphere with a mass that depends explicitly on time, also
   interpretable as an explicitly time dependent quadratic potential. We
   show that, under quite mild restrictions on the time dependence of the
   mass, the specific Fock representation of the canonical commutation
   relations which is naturally associated with a massless free field
   provides a unitary dynamics even when the time varying mass is present.
   Moreover, we demonstrate that this Fock representation is the only
   acceptable one, up to unitary equivalence, if the vacuum has to be
   SO(4)-invariant (i.e., invariant under the symmetries of the field
   equation) and the dynamics is required to be unitary. In particular, the
   analysis and uniqueness of the quantization can be applied to the
   treatment of cosmological perturbations around
   Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with the spatial topology of the
   three-sphere, like e. g. for gravitational waves (tensor perturbations).
   In addition, we analyze the extension of our results to free fields with
   a time dependent mass defined on other compact spatial manifolds. We
   prove the uniqueness of the Fock representation in the case of a
   two-sphere as well, and discuss the case of a three-torus.},

   structure of the female externa and its resident males is crucial for
   understanding both the reproductive biology and the taxonomy of these
   specialized parasites. We use scanning electron microscopy and
   histological methods to study the anatomy of juvenile and the mature
   externae of the rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus parasitizing
   the blue crab Callinectes rathbunae. We put emphasis on the implantation
   of males and the histology of the female reproductive organs. In the
   virgin externae, male cyprids attach around a cuticular hood covering
   the mantle aperture, which is partially blocked by a plug of cuticle so
   only trichogon larvae, not cyprids, can access the mantle cavity. This
   resembles the situation known from Sacculina carcini. The mature externa
   is characterized by a visceral mass that contains the ovary, paired
   colleteric glands, a single male receptacle, but paired receptacle
   ducts. The proximal attachment of the visceral mass is located at some
   distance from the basal stalk, as is characteristic for the genus
   Loxothylacus. The internal anatomy of the mature externa of L. texanus
   is in most features similar to that seen in other species of the
   Sacculinidae, which comprises the majority of rhizocephalan species.
   However, the single receptacle creates a situation where the two
   implanted males cannot be kept separate as in most other rhizocephalans,
   but pass through spermatogenesis in a common chamber. This may have
   unknown effects on the reproductive biology such as male-male
   competition. J. Morphol. 271:190-199, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) is the central key structure for meiosis
   in organisms undergoing sexual reproduction. During meiotic prophase I,
   homologous chromosomes exchange genetic information at the time they are
   attached to the lateral elements by specific DNA sequences. Most of
   these sequences, so far identified, consist of repeat DNA, which are
   subject to chromatin structural changes during meiotic prophase I. In
   this work, we addressed the effect of altering the chromatin structure
   of repeat DNA sequences mediating anchorage to the lateral elements of
   the SC. Administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin
   A into live rats caused death of cells in the pachytene stage as well as
   changes in histone marks along the synaptonemal complex. The most
   notable effect was partial loss of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation.
   Our work describes the epigenetic landscape of lateral
   element-associated chromatin and reveals a critical role of histone
   marks in synaptonemal complex integrity.},

Title = {Functional traits and environmental filtering drive community assembly

Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mechanistic models of community assembly state that biotic and abiotic
   filters constrain species establishment through selection on their
   functional traits. Predicting this assembly process is hampered because
   few studies directly incorporate environmental measurements and scale
   LIP from species to community level and because the functional traits'
   significance is environment dependent. We analyzed community assembly by
   measuring structure, environmental conditions, and species traits of
   secondary forests in a species-rich tropical system. We found, as
   hypothesized, that community structure shaped the local environment and
   that strong relationships existed between this environment and the
   traits of the most Successful species of the regeneration communities.
   Path and multivariate analyses showed that temperature and leaf traits
   that regulate it were the most important factors of community
   differentiation. Comparisons between the trait composition of the
   forest's regeneration, juvenile, and adult communities showed a
   Consistent community assembly pattern. These results allowed LIS to
   identify the major functional traits and environmental factors involved
   in the assembly of dry-forest Communities and demonstrate that
   environmental filtering is a predictable and fundamental process of
   community assembly, even in a complex system such as a tropical forest.},

Abstract = {A new procedure is presented that combines well-known nuclear models

   taking the differences between measured masses and the predictions given
   by the different theoretical models. This image is viewed as part of a
   larger array in the (N, Z) plane, where unknown nuclear masses are
   hidden, covered by a ``mask.{''} We apply a suitably adapted
   deconvolution algorithm, used in astronomical observations, to ``open
   the window{''} and see the rest of the pattern. We show that it is
   possible to improve significantly mass predictions in regions not too
   far from measured nuclear masses.},

Abstract = {We calculate the diffusion coefficients of persistent random walks on
   lattices, where the direction of a walker at a given step depends on the
   memory of a certain number of previous steps. In particular, we describe
   a simple method which enables us to obtain explicit expressions for the
   diffusion coefficients of walks with a two-step memory on different
   classes of one-, two- and higher dimensional lattices.},

Title = {Rapid Decline of a Grassland System and Its Ecological and Conservation
   Implications},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {One of the most important conservation issues in ecology is the
   imperiled state of grassland ecosystems worldwide due to land
   conversion, desertification, and the loss of native populations and
   species. The Janos region of northwestern Mexico maintains one of the
   largest remaining black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colony
   complexes in North America and supports a high diversity of threatened
   and endangered species. Yet, cattle grazing, agriculture, and drought
   have greatly impacted the region. We evaluated the impact of human
   activities on the Janos grasslands, comparing changes in the vertebrate
   community over the last two decades. Our results reveal profound, rapid
   changes in the Janos grassland community, demonstrating large declines
   in vertebrate abundance across all taxonomic groups. We also found that
   the 55,000 ha prairie dog colony complex has declined by 73\% since
   1988. The prairie dog complex has become increasingly fragmented, and
   their densities have shown a precipitous decline over the years, from an
   average density of 25 per ha in 1988 to 2 per ha in 2004. We
   demonstrated that prairie dogs strongly suppressed woody plant
   encroachment as well as created open grassland habitat by clearing woody
   vegetation, and found rapid invasion of shrubland once the prairie dogs
   disappeared from the grasslands. Comparison of grasslands and shrublands
   showed markedly different species compositions, with species richness
   being greatest when both habitats were considered together. Our data
   demonstrate the rapid decline of a grassland ecosystem, and documents
   the dramatic loss in biodiversity over a very short time period
   concomitant with anthropogenic grassland degradation and the decline of
   a keystone species.},

Abstract = {The abundance patterns of leaf litter and soil springtails (Hexapoda:
   Collembola) from two hydrological watersheds of the Chamela Biological
   Station (EBCh, UNAM) in Jalisco, Mexico are described and compared based
   on monthly sampling over one year. This locality, where the dominant
   vegetation is tropical dry forest, had an atypically high rainfall
   during the sampling period, with the greatest amount of rain during
   January. Sampling in both biotopes was random, the areas sampled were of
   the same size (95 cm(2)), and these were processed in situ using Berlese
   funnels. In addition, different edaphic characteristics were quantified.
   The effect of watershed, biotope and seasonality factors on the
   abundance of Collembola families was analysed. Using Cluster Analysis
   (CA), the faunistic relationships between the assemblages were explored,
   and using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) the relationships
   between assemblages and the physico-chemical variables of the soil. A
   total of 24.253 Collembola were obtained, belonging to 13 families. The
   most abundant were Isotomidae, Entomobryidae, Hypogastruridae and
   Sminthuridae. The CA showed more similarity between biotopes than
   between hydrological watersheds, while in the CCA the most important
   variable to explain the distribution and abundance of the Collembola was
   humidity.},

Abstract = {The pi-calculus process algebra describes the interaction of concurrent
   and communicating processes. The pi-calculus, however, has neither
   explicit agency nor epistemic capabilities. In this paper, we present
   the formal syntax and semantics of a multi-agent dynamic epistemic
   logic. In this logic, the epistemic actions of agents are pi-calculus
   processes. A process of the language is translated to a class of model
   updating functions reflecting the epistemic changes after the execution
   of such processes. Our proposal combines the capabilities of two
   approaches: it is possible to model structured interaction among agents
   as elaborated pi-calculus programs, and it is also possible to describe
   the dynamic knowledge implications of such programs. We show the utility
   of our language by encoding the Dining Cryptographers protocol.},

Abstract = {Ambient dose equivalent values were determined in several sites at the
   Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Department de Medicina Nuclear,
   using TLD-100 and TLD-900 thermoluminescent dosemeters. Additionally,
   ambient dose equivalent was measured at a corridor outside the
   hospitalization room for patients treated with Cs-137 brachytherapy.
   Dosemeter calibration was performed at the Instituto Nacional de
   Investigaciones Nucleares, Laboratorio de Metrologia, to known Cs-137
   gamma radiation air kerma. Radionuclides, considered for this study are
   I-131, F-18, Ga-67, Tc-99m, In-111, Tl-201 and Cs-137, with main gamma
   energies between 93 and 662 keV. Dosemeters were placed during a five
   month period in the nuclear medicine rooms (containing gamma-cameras),
   injection corridor, patient waiting areas, PET/CT study room, hot lab,
   waste storage room and corridors next to the hospitalization rooms for
   patients treated with I-131 and Cs-137. High dose values were found at
   the waste storage room, outside corridor of Cs-137 brachytherapy
   patients and PET/CT area. Ambient dose equivalent rate obtained for the
   Cs-137 brachytherapy corridor is equal to (18.51 +/- 0.02) x 10(-3)
   mSv/h. Sites with minimum doses are the gamma camera rooms, having
   ambient dose equivalent rates equal to (0.05 +/- 0.03) x 10(-3) mSv/h.
   Recommendations have been given to the Department authorities so that
   further actions are taken to reduce doses at high dose sites in order to
   comply with the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable).},

Abstract = {Many physical and biological phenomena involve accumulation and
   discharge processes that can occur on significantly different time
   scales. Models of these processes have contributed to understand
   excitability self-sustained oscillations and synchronization in arrays
   of oscillators. Integrate-and-fire (I+F) models are popular minimal
   fill-and-flush mathematical models. They are used in neuroscience to
   study spiking and phase locking in single neuron membranes, large scale
   neural networks, and in a variety of applications in physics and
   electrical engineering. We show here how the classical first-order I+F
   model fits into the theory of nonlinear oscillators of van der Pol type
   by demonstrating that a particular second-order oscillator having small
   parameters converges in a singular perturbation limit to the I+F model.
   In this sense, our study provides a novel unfolding of such models and
   it identifies a constructible electronic circuit that is closely related
   to I+F.},

Title = {GEOGENIC AND ANTHROPOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS
   IN SUPERFICIAL SEDIMENTS FROM CUITZEO LAKE, MEXICO},
Booktitle = {RIVER SEDIMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Research Advances},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {37-75},
Abstract = {The present chapter describes the most common methods utilized to obtain
   metal background values for soil and sediments. These techniques are
   helpful when it is necessary to differentiate the background metal
   concentration in the area from the pollutant metal concentration. These
   techniques are exemplified using a case study. The study showed the
   limitations and capability of the different approaches to differentiate
   the geogenic and anthropogenic origin of the potentially toxic elements
   in multiple stressed lake sediment.
   The studied area is one of the two largest lakes in Mexico. This lake
   lies in the area of influence of the Neovolcanic alignment,
   characterized by its geological activity; it is also near the city of
   Morelia whose wastewater (industrial and domestic) ultimately ends up in
   the lake after watering the agricultural lands in close proximity to the
   lake. The complexity of the system becomes a challenge for the different
   methods used to discriminate the geogenic and anthropogenic sources of
   potentially toxic elements. The geostatistical analytical techniques
   utilized were able to define unique distribution patterns for each
   element and through their comparison, establish the polluted areas and
   the degree of contamination. These techniques though, are used as
   exploratory tools in the spatial analysis of the data, and the results
   obtained, while preliminaries, allow the visualization of the pollution
   problem of the lake.
   The data were obtained from an intensive systematic sampling of the
   central part of the lake. The sediment samples were acid digested and
   total concentration of As, Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu, V, Cr, Co, Sb, Ti, Mn, Sr,
   Cr, Fe, Al and Zn were determined. Physicochemical properties pH,
   electric conductivity and total organic carbon were also obtained.
   The results showed that Fe and Al have a spatial distribution that could
   be considered of geogenic origin, while Ti, Zn and As have a spatial
   distribution pointing to geogenic origin but with spots with higher
   concentrations than the rest of the area, indicating a possible
   pollution. Lead, copper nickel and cadmium, differentiated three main
   areas: one most probably influenced by the agricultural activity and the
   wastewater input, another with almost no input of the metals, and the
   third one with atypical concentration for the various metals that could
   not be attributed to any known source.
   Total organic carbon and electric conductivity were good complements as
   indicators of probable polluted areas, while pH was not a good indicator
   since the lake sediments had high buffer capacity.},

Abstract = {The diversity of invertebrates in corticolous moss was compared along an
   altitudinal gradient on the NW slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, in the
   central part of Mexico. Sixteen taxa of invertebrates from corticolous
   moss were recorded, among which the Mesostigmata, Prostigmata, Astigmata
   and Cryptostigmata were the most abundant, making up 81\%. The
   Mesostigmata showed their maximum abundance (45\%) at 3.020 m elevation,
   Prostigmata at 2.830 m (44\%), Astigmata at 2.750 m (12\%) and
   Cryptostigmata (75\%) at 3,250 m. There was spatial variation in the
   density of invertebrates; the highest density was found at 3.250 m and
   the lowest at 2.750 m. The highest diversity was recorded between 2.750
   and 2.930 m. The highest similarity was observed between 2.750 and 2.930
   m. For the Opilionida, Cryptostigmata and Psocoptera there was a
   positive correlation between altitude and density while the density of
   Oligochaeta, Araneae and Hemiptera was negatively correlated with

Abstract = {Many dynamical systems from different areas of knowledge can be studied
   within the theoretical framework of time series, where the system can be
   considered as a black box, that only needs to be ``listened{''} to. In
   this framework, non-correlated series (white noise) and strongly
   correlated series (brownian noise or periodic series) constitute two
   extremes. Certain dynamical systems auto-organize in a critical state
   that is characterized by 1/f or flicker noise. The family of f(beta)
   noises (beta <= 0) is fractal because fragments of the series are
   statistically identical to the original time series. 1/f noise (beta =
   -1) is critical because it maximizes important complexity-related
   quantities as memory, information content, efficiency and fractality.
   1/f noise has been observed in classical systems, but also in quantum
   systems, and could possibly offer a unifying bridge of understanding
   between the macroscopic and the quantum world. In the present article,
   we will discuss some examples from both worlds.},

Title = {Circadian locomotor activity and response to different light conditions

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {269-278},
Abstract = {The volcano mouse, Neotomodon alstoni, was studied in order to describe
   basic circadian behavior during free running and entrainment to
   parametric and non-parametric photoperiods. Responses to short and long
   days were also tested to ascertain any potential photoperiodic response.
   This species is endemic to the high grasslands of central Mexico. Its
   breeding peaks during summer, indicating a possible circannual
   regulation of reproduction. Our results indicate that locomotor activity
   in Neotomodon alstoni is typical of a nocturnal rodent when studied
   using running wheels, however, when activity was observed in freely
   moving recordings with no running wheel, locomotor activity shifts to a
   semidiurnal architecture when exposed to long day photoperiods. When
   gonadal activity was studied in males exposed to short and long days,
   significant differences were observed in testis size, nevertheless
   levels of testosterone and seminiferous tubuli indicated that day length
   does not inhibit sexual maturity in this species. The results indicated
   that N. alstoni may not be photoperiodic with regard to gonadal
   activity, however it does display photoperiodic differences with regard
   to behavior, body weight and testis size.},

Abstract = {Querying inconsistent databases remains a broad and difficult problem.
   In this work, we study how to improve aggregations computed on databases
   with referential errors in the context of database integration, where
   each source database has different tables, columns with similar content
   across multiple databases. but different referential integrity
   constraints. Thus, a query in an integrated database may involve tables
   and columns with referential integrity errors. In a data warehouse, even
   though the ETL processes fix referential integrity errors, this is
   generally done by inserting ``dummy{''} records into the dimension
   tables corresponding to such invalid foreign keys, thereby artificially
   enforcing referential integrity. When two tables are joined and
   aggregations are computed, rows with an invalid or null foreign key
   value are skipped, effectively eliminating potentially valuable
   information. With that motivation in mind, we extend SQL aggregate
   functions computed over tables with referential integrity issues to
   return complete answer sets in the sense that no row is excluded. We
   associate to each referenced key in the dimension table, a probability
   that invalid or null foreign keys refer to it. Our main idea is to
   compute aggregations over joined tables including rows with invalid or
   null references by distributing their contribution to aggregation
   totals, based on probabilities computed over correct foreign keys.
   Experiments with real and synthetic databases evaluate the usefulness,
   accuracy and performance of our extended aggregations. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Two of the most important proteins linking the contractile apparatus and
   costameres at the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle fibers are dystrophin
   and desmin. We have developed an elastic model of the proteins that link
   the sarcolemma to the myofibrils. This is a distributed model, with an
   elastic constant, k, that includes the main protein components of the
   costameres. The distributed spring model is composed of parallel units
   attached in series. To test the model, we performed experiments in which
   we applied negative pressure, generated by an elastimeter, to a small
   area of the sarcolemma from single myofiber. The negative pressure
   formed a bleb of variable height, dependent on the pressure applied. We
   normalized our measurements of k in dystrophin-null (mdx) and
   desmin-null (des-/-) mice to the value we obtained for wild type (WT)
   mice, which was set at 1.0. The relative experimental value for the
   stiffness of myofibers from mice lacking dystrophin or desmin was 0.5
   and 0.7, respectively. The theoretical k values of the individual
   elements were obtained using neural networks (NN), in which the input
   was the k value for each parallel spring component and the output was
   the solution of each resulting parallel system. We compare the
   experimental values of k in control and mutant muscles to the
   theoretical values obtained by NN for each protein. Computed theoretical
   values were 0.4 and 0.8 for dystrophin- and desmin-null muscles,
   respectively, and 0.9 for WT, in reasonable agreement with our
   experimental results. This suggests that, although it is a simplified
   spring model solved by NN, it provides a good approximation of the
   distribution of spring elements and the elastic constants of the
   proteins that form the costameres. Our results show that dystrophin is
   the protein that contributes more than any other to the strength of the
   connections between the sarcolemma and the contractile apparatus, the
   costameres.},

Abstract = {1. The aim of the present study was to analyze histological and
   stereological changes in the tubular compartment in Gallus domesticus
   testes, as well as the variations in the number and size of their cells,
   from the start of morphological differentiation of the gonads (8-d
   chick-embryo) until the adult reproductive stage (28 weeks old). 2. In
   embryonic chick testes, the total volume occupied by the interstitial
   tissue is greater than that occupied by the tubular compartment, but in
   the post-hatched chick the total volume of tubular compartment exceeds
   that of the interstitial tissue. 3. From day 1 until 28 weeks of age,
   the seminiferous tubules increased in total volume, diameter, and
   epithelial height, which was directly related to the increase in the
   number of Sertoli and germ cells and the size of Sertoli cells. 4. In
   the testes of one-day- and 6-week-old chicks, Sertoli cells were the
   most abundant cell type in the seminiferous tubules due to hyperplasia,
   but in 28-week-old birds the germ cells were the most abundant cell
   type. Hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia of Sertoli cells appears to be
   responsible for the increase in the total volume of seminiferous
   tubules. 5. There are marked age-dependent changes in the tubular
   compartment of chick testes that help to understand the histological and
   stereological events occurring during normal development.},

Abstract = {Long-term circadian locomotor activity under different light conditions
   and its corresponding free running periods were studied in the juvenile
   red-eared turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. Diurnal activity and a long
   free running period in darkness was observed in LD 12:12, skeleton
   photoperiod, and long and short days (LD 16:08, LD 08:16, respectively).
   Anticipation of activity to lights-on and length of activity phase
   depends on the photoperiod used. After-effects were observed in free
   running conditions after long day photoperiods. Constant light effect
   produces mainly the lack of circadian rhythm after a few days of period
   lengthening and the lack of rhythm may persist for a few days after
   re-entering constant darkness conditions. The results of the present
   report indicate that in T. scripta elegans, it is suitable to perform
   studies on circadian biology in juvenile turtles and its interaction
   with changes of photoperiod at constant temperature.},

Abstract = {A physical interpretation is given to a curious ``hump{''} that develops
   in the chemical potential as a function of absolute temperature in an
   ideal Fermi gas for any spatial dimensionality d < 2, integer or not, in
   contrast with the more familiar monotonic decrease for all d >= 2. The
   hump height increases without limit, as d decreases to zero. The
   divergence at d = 0 is shown to be a clear manifestation of the Pauli
   Exclusion Principle whereby two spinless fermions cannot sit on top of
   each other in configuration space. The hump itself is thus an obvious
   precursor of this manifestation, otherwise well understood in momentum
   space. It also constitutes an ``ideal quantum dot{''} when d = 0.},

Abstract = {The development of forest succession theory has been based on studies in
   temperate and tropical wet forests. As rates and pathways of succession
   vary with the environment, advances in successional theory and study
   approaches are challenged by controversies derived from such variation
   and by the scarcity of studies in other ecosystems. During five years,
   we studied development pathways and dynamics in a chronosequence
   spanning from very early to late successional stages (ca. 1-60 years) in
   a tropical dry forest of Mexico. We (1) contrasted dynamic pathways of
   change in structure, diversity, and species composition with static,
   chronosequence-based trends, (2) examined how structure and successional
   dynamics of guilds of trees shape community change, and (3) assessed the
   predictability of succession in this system. Forest diversity and
   structure increased with time but tree density stabilized early in
   succession. Dynamic pathways matched chronosequence trends. Succession
   consisted of two tree-dominated phases characterized by the development
   and dynamics of a pioneer and a mature forest species guild,
   respectively. Pioneer species dominated early recruitment (until ca. 10
   years after abandonment), and declined before slower growing
   mature-forest species became dominant or reached maximum development
   rates (after 40-45 years). Pioneers promoted their replacement early in
   succession, while mature-forest species recruited and grew constantly
   throughout the process, with their lowest mortality coinciding with the
   peak of pioneer abundance. In contrast to prevailing stochastic views,
   we observed an orderly, community driven series of changes in this dry
   forest secondary succession. Chronosequences thus represent a valuable
   approach for revealing system-specific successional pathways,
   formulating hypotheses on causes and mechanisms and, in combination with
   repeated sampling, evaluating the effects of vegetation dynamics in
   pathway variation. (C) 2010 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and

Title = {CIRCADIAN MODULATION OF CRUSTACEAN HYPERGLYCEMIC HORMONE IN CRAYFISH
   EYESTALK AND RETINA},
Journal = {CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-51},
Abstract = {Previous studies suggested the retina could be a putative locus of daily
   crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) secretion, as it possesses its
   own metabolic machinery and is independent of the well-known CHH
   eyestalk locus responsible for the circadian secretion of this peptide.
   However, it has been proposed that hemolymph glucose and lactate
   concentrations play a dual role in the regulation of CHH in crayfish. To
   elucidate the temporal relationship between these two different CHH
   production loci and to examine their relationship with glucose
   regulation, we investigated the expression of CHH daily and circadian
   rhythms in the eyestalk and retina of crayfish using biochemical methods
   and time series analysis. We wanted to determine whether (1) putative
   retina and eyestalk CHH rhythmic expressions are correlated and if the
   oscillations of the two metabolic products of lactate and glucose in the
   blood due to CHH action on the target tissue correlate, and (2) retina
   CHH (RCHH) and the possible retinal substrate glycogen and its product
   glucose are temporally correlated. We found a negative correlation
   between daily and circadian changes of relative CHH abundance in the
   retina and eyestalk. This correlation and the cross-correlation values
   found between eyestalk CHH and hemolymph and glucose confirm that CHH
   produced by the X-organ sinus gland complex is under the previously
   proposed dual feedback control system over the 24 h time period.
   However, the presence of both glycogen and glucose in the retina, the
   cross-correlation values found between these parameters and hemolymph
   lactate and glucose, as well as RCHH and hemolymph and retina metabolic
   markers suggest RCHH is not under the same temporal metabolic control as
   eyestalk CHH. Nonetheless, their expression may be linked to common
   rhythms-generating processes. (Author correspondence:

Abstract = {Current loss of biodiversity places a premium on the task of recognizing
   and formulating proposals on potential areas for biological conservation
   based on scientific criteria; among these tasks, identification of
   hotspots has a relevant role on conservation of biodiversity. Among the
   approaches used in their recognition, biogeographic methods have a
   relevant role. In this study, we discuss the application of different
   biogeographic methods to identify plant biodiversity hotspots, based on
   the congruence among areas of endemism, panbiogeographic nodes, and
   Pleistocene refugia. Land plants are one of the best known biological
   groups that can be used as a test model for studies in biological
   diversity. Our study is based on previous biogeographic analyses of
   mosses, gymnosperms and angiosperms carried out in different places
   around the world, where panbiogeographic nodes and areas of endemism
   have been proposed for these plants, also including refugia proposed
   worldwide based on different biological groups. A remarkable congruence
   among these areas recognized by the application of different
   biogeographic methods for these plant groups is noted in western North
   America, Appalachian, Mesoamerica, southern Chile, southeastern Brazil,
   central Africa, Japan, southeastern China, Tasmania, New Caledonia,
   northeastern Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand; this congruence
   indicates that these areas deserve special status in plant biodiversity
   and conservation. We propose that these areas identified by different
   biogeographic methods are important biodiversity areas and can be
   recognized as hotspots; these areas have a relevant role in plant
   biodiversity and are important in conservation due to their climatic
   conditions (refugia), the historical factors that have been involved in
   their evolution (nodes), and the restricted distribution of some plant
   taxa that inhabit them (areas of endemism).},

Title = {THREATENED TEMPERATE PLANT SPECIES: CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR BIOGEOGRAPHY
   AND CONSERVATION IN MEXICO},
Booktitle = {SPECIES DIVERSITY AND EXTINCTION},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {317-339},
Abstract = {Many species of vascular plants inhabiting the Mexican temperate forests
   are threatened by continuous environmental impact, mainly due to human
   activities. Some are recorded in some risk category in the Mexican
   official publication named `Norma Oficial Mexicana 059'
   (NOM-059-ECOL-2001), in the IUCN red lists (the World Conservation
   Union) or in CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered
   Species). Distribution maps of 31 threatened species of vascular plants
   were generated or updated with information obtained from institutional
   databases, herbarium specimens, field work, and specialized literature;
   with this information, we analyzed species richness, endemism and
   distributional patterns. Mexican territory was divided using a grid
   system based on a chart index (scale 1:50,000 composed system by grids
   of 15' x 20'). Factors that represent a threat for these species, to
   their current habitats and natural populations are discussed, and some
   strategies are proposed to prevent their extinction. Regarding
   conservation, we evaluated their geographic distribution based on
   current Mexican National Protected Areas (NPAs) and Mexican Priority
   Terrestrial Regions for Conservation (PTRs). We also suggest the urgent
   incorporation of some of these species in the recent IUCN Red Data List
   of Threatened Species (2009) and in the NOM-059. Most of the grid-cells
   with high diversity and endemism are located in eastern Mexico, and are
   especially associated with mountain landscapes. Among the factors that
   represent a threat, we concluded that the main problem for all species
   is habitat destruction, due to increase in agricultural areas, forest
   exploitation, and animal husbandry, followed by expansion of human
   settlements, illicit extraction, and traffic of plants. Most of the
   species studied require special policies for their conservation due to
   problems that affect their natural populations. Conservation strategies
   include: (1) demographic and ecological studies of these species; (2)
   collection of seeds and vegetative propagation for ex situ conservation
   in botanical gardens; (3) targeting of specific areas where these
   species inhabit, in order to include them in future conservation plans.
   With few exceptions, these species are underrepresented in the current
   Mexican System of Natural Protected Areas, especially those with
   restricted distributions. Only six species are represented in five or
   more NAPs, allowing their populations to be protected. In the case of
   PTRs, most of the species listed are included, but these areas are not
   official nor are they regulated by federal laws.},

Abstract = {Mexico is one of the 10 more important garlic producing countries in the
   world. Within Mexico, Guanajuato state is the main garlic producer, with
   50-70\% of the total garlic export. Recent data show that there are 19
   genera and 169 named species in the Ereynetidae, more than half the
   number of species are in the Speleognathinae, all of them are parasites.
   In total 51 species of free-living ereynetids belong to the genus
   Ereynetes. Until now Ereynetes (Opsereynetes) simplexus, E. (0.)
   robustus, E. (Anereynetes) tuberculatus, E. (A.) sabinensis, E.
   (Ereynetes) amplectorus, E. (E.) faini, and Riccardoella oudemansi have
   been described and/or recorded from Mexico. Seven Boydaia spp., two
   Neoboydaio spp., and one Trispeleognathus species associated with birds
   are also cited. In this study we collected soil samples inside garlic
   crops in several localities of two municipalities in the state of
   Guanajuato from 2002 to 2005. Two species of Ereynetidae are recorded
   for the first time for garlic crops, Ereynetes (E.) amplectorus and E.
   (E.) faini with 179 and 81 specimens respectively; a total of 260
   specimens were studied. Data on the presence of females, ovigerous
   females, males, and juveniles collected in the course of the garlic crop
   season are included. Females were more numerous than males in both
   species. The egg structure is described.},

Abstract = {We have previously shown that soluble factor(s) in conditioned media
   (CM) from the central and peripheral regions of the anterior pituitary
   (AP) gland of lactating rats promoted the in vitro dose-related release
   of prolactin (PRL) from pituitary glands of male rats. In the present
   experiments we sought to determine whether CM from rats in different
   physiological states provoked similar effects (like those of lactating
   rats), and the nature of the factors, whether 23K PRL or other variants
   of the hormone, were responsible for these effects. Stimulatory effects
   were induced by CM from pregnant females and steroid-treated castrated
   males or females, but not from untreated castrated rats, intact males,
   or by a PRL standard. More potent effects occurred with CM from APs of
   early-than from mid-or late-lactating rats, and from rats unsuckled for
   8 or 16 h than from those unsuckled for 32 h. With respect to the nature
   of factor(s) responsible for these effects, immunoprecipitation of PRL
   from the CM of lactating females and of steroid-treated, castrated males
   eliminated, whereas dephosphorylation or deglycosylation of CM of
   lactating rats greatly increased its effects upon PRL release. Also,
   electrophoretic analysis and Western blotting of the CM proteins under
   native and denaturing conditions revealed a variety of PRL variants,
   ranging from 14 to <90 kDa, in CM from lactating rats, and the main
   effects on PRL release were provoked by the 23- to 46-kDa PRL variants.
   These results indicate that specific effects upon male rat lactotropes
   may be exerted by PRL variants released from APs of lactating and
   non-lactating rats. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {We propose a viscosity model accounting for experiments of emulsions of
   two immiscible liquids at arbitrary volume fractions. The model is based
   on a recursive-differential method formulated in terms of the
   appropriate scaling variable which emerges from an analysis of excluded
   volume effects in the system. This variable, called the effective
   filling fraction, incorporates the geometrical information of the system
   which determines the maximum packing and reduces to the bare filling
   fraction for infinitely diluted emulsions. The agreement of our model
   for the viscosity with experiments and previous theories is good for all
   the range of volume fractions and viscosity ratios.},

Abstract = {The synthesis of LaxAl2-xO3 films using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis
   technique are reported. The films were deposited from a spraying
   solution of aluminum acetylacetonate (Al(acac)(3)) and lanthanum(III)
   nitrate hexahydrate La(NO3)(3)6H(2)O dissolved in N,N-Dimethylformamide
   on (100) Si substrates. The substrate temperature during was in the
   range 500-600 degrees C. The mean roughness was lower than 18 angstrom
   in all cases. The films were amorphous in all cases. The optical band
   gap was 5.42 eV and the refractive index was in the 1.64-1.72 range
   depending of the deposition conditions.},

Abstract = {We examined changes in the histology, physiology and enzymatic activity
   of the digestive gland as well as changes in morphology and feeding
   behavior-of Octopus maya during rearing, to define the phases
   characterizing post-hatching development. Morphometric changes showed
   that juvenile O. maya exhibited a non-growth phase during the first 10 d
   post-hatching (DPH). Histological analysis revealed that the digestive
   gland morphology changed with age, from a simple tubular gland in
   octopuses 2 DPH to a tubulo-acinar and vacuolar structure with digestive
   cells characterized by vacuoles in octopuses 45 DPH. Digestive enzyme
   activity was erratic until 14 DPH, after which the activity started to
   stabilize. O. maya at 2 and 3 DPH rarely presented attack responses to
   either visual or both visual and chemical stimuli from prey. In
   contrast, at 4 DPH, octopuses responded to visual stimuli from crabs and
   palaemonids, but did not display preference in attacking either prey
   type. Based on our results, we have defined for the first time 2 phases
   in the early life history of O. maya: post-hatching and juvenile.},

Title = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOGEOGRAPHY: PRINCIPLES AND METHODS},
Booktitle = {BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Series = {Environmental Research Advances},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {1-62},
Abstract = {Evolutionary biogeography integrates distributional, phylogenetic,
   molecular and paleontological data in order to discover biogeographic
   patterns and assess the historical changes that have shaped them,
   following a step-wise approach. Although most of the authors involved in
   the theoretical development of biogeography or that apply specific
   methods usually conceive them as representing alternative ``schools{''},
   they can be used to answer different questions. This review introduces
   the steps of this integrative approach and details the available
   methods. An evolutionary biogeographical analysis involves five steps:
   (1) recognition of biotic components (sets of spatio-temporally
   integrated taxa due to common history), through panbiogeography and
   methods used to identify areas of endemism; (2) contrastation of the
   biotic components and identification of the vicariant events that
   fragmented them, through cladistic biogeography and comparative
   phylogeography; (3) establishment of a hierarchic arrangement of the
   components in a biogeographic system of realms, regions, dominions,
   provinces and districts; (4) identification of cenocrons (sets of taxa
   with similar origins and ages), dated using intraspecific
   phylogeography, molecular clocks and fossils; and (5) formulation of a
   geobiotic scenario, that explains the evolution of the biotic components
   and cenocrons, integrating geological and tectonical information.},

Title = {Treatment with chitosan protects habanero pepper against the infection
   with Phytophthora capsici},
Journal = {ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {61-65},
Abstract = {Similar to most members of the genus Capsicum, the habanero pepper
   (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) is susceptible to the deadly disease
   Phytophthora blight caused by the oomycete Phytophthora capsici.
   Currently, this pathogen is controlled mainly with agrochemicals, a
   non-effective strategy with undesirable effects on the environment and
   human health. In this work, we evaluated the protective effect of
   chitosan against the infection with P. capsici. Cultivation of P.
   capsici in vitro in the presence of 10 mu g . mL(-1) chitosan reduced
   its growth significantly; however, higher concentrations (100 and 500 mu
   g . mL(-1)) practically blocked its growth (by 90 and 95\%,
   respectively). On the other hand, spraying high concentrations of
   chitosan (100 and 500 mu g . mL(-1)) on three-month-old habanero pepper
   plants prevented the spreading of the oomycete, but lower concentrations
   (1 and 10 mu g . mL(-1)) did not prevent the disease. Interestingly, the
   application of chitosan did not protect the plants if they were
   previously wounded; thus, it is possible that the treatment has a direct
   effect on the oomycte, instead of producing a defense-related response
   in the plant. Since chitosan is an innocuous food additive, our results
   suggest it can be used as an environmentally friendly complement to the
   traditional agronomical practices in the control of Phytophthora blight
   in peppers.},

Abstract = {Changing climates are affecting biodiversity and natural systems,
   causing extinctions, range shifts, and phenological shifts. Efforts to
   forecast the spatial distribution and magnitude of these effects,
   however, have focused largely on direct effects of changing climates on
   species' distributional potential; recent work has considered secondary
   effects of warming climates via rising sea levels. Here, we present a
   first integration of the two dimensions of climate change effects on
   biodiversity, examining joint effects of marine intrusion and climate
   change on the distributional potential of seventy-six species of Mexican
   birds. The two phenomena are not related to one another-that is, a
   species seriously affected by one is not necessarily seriously affected
   by the other; however, the areas affected within species' distributions
   by the two phenomena tend to be complementary, compounding the negative
   effects. These results have implications for planning biodiversity
   conservation globally.},

Abstract = {The Tambula-Picachos is a 390.22 Km(2) watershed situated in an arid
   land region, where almost 80,000 inhabitants are dedicated to tourism
   activities (urban areas), agriculture and livestock management (rural
   settlements). This paper aims to communicate the development of a
   participative and integrated approach for watershed management as a base
   line to cope with water scarcity and preventing natural risks derived
   from annual rainfall events. This approach was applied on two scales:
   the watershed and their nine micro-watersheds. Hydrological studies
   showed a short time concentration at the two scales (13 to 39 min for
   microwatersheds and 247 min to watershed) which indicated very fast
   hydrological responses. Vegetal cover has been altered for the last 100
   years, conserved fragments are limited to the headwater areas, therefore
   erosion is moderate in about 70 \% of the watershed, however 21\% of the
   watershed area is under high erosion rates (500 ton/ha/yr), mainly in
   the watershed transition zone (the main water recharge area). Monitoring
   of runoff water in temporal streams and agricultural small reservoirs,
   showed moderate values of water quality, since poor peasant agricultural
   practices do not include agrochemicals use. Land and water management
   for agriculture are limited to basic techniques in the transition area
   of the watershed, in comparison to groundwater irrigation agriculture
   developed in the watershed alluvial valley, which is also affected by
   floodings on extreme rainfall events caused by stream channel
   modification, road construction and elimination of the riparian
   vegetation buffers. Participative commissions developed a Management
   Plan where habitants, academics and government representatives took
   decisions to maintain and improve quality of runoff water and watershed
   functioning working at the micro-watershed scale: maintain and restore
   vegetal cover, protect soils and offering alternative projects on water
   collection and its use to improve their life quality.},

Abstract = {In this study, two Lactuca sativa crops grown in a net-protected site
   and an unprotected site were compared. The results showed metals were
   accumulated by Lactuca sativa. Higher metal accumulation in lettuce
   grown in the unprotected parcel was established, and the only
   significant differences in their physicochemical properties were cation
   exchange capacity and exposure to sunlight. Exposure to the sun may
   translate into higher soil-plant flux of water and/or higher
   decomposition rate of organic matter, which may augment the mobilization
   of metals into the plant, and therefore lead to higher noxious metal
   accumulation on the crops. Also, EDTA was explored as a possible
   extractant that could predict the bioavailablity of metals to the
   lettuce. Our results did not show a good agreement between the metal
   transferred from soil to leaves and the EDTA extracted metals, although
   some tendencies were found for the metal transfer from soil to roots. It
   is predicted that many developing countries will continue and/or
   increase the use of waste water for the irrigation of crops despite the
   health risks. Different solutions have been explored to diminish the
   availability of the metals in the soils. Our study shows that an action
   as simple as placing a net over the parcel could help diminish the
   accumulation of metals into the crops of a rapidly expanding peri-urban
   agricultural system.},

   calculating bounds for the width of vertical counting rates. The spatial
   correlation between idler and signal photons is illustrated with a
   coincidence distribution of the coordinate pair (x(s),x(i)), with x(i,s)
   the idler (signal) detector position in horizontal scan.},

Abstract = {Surfaces of buildings at the archaeological site of Palenque, Mexico,
   are colonized by cyanobacteria that form biofilms, which in turn cause
   aesthetic and structural damage. The structural characterization and
   species composition of biofilms from the walls of one of these
   buildings, El Palacio, are reported. The distribution of photosynthetic
   microorganisms in the biofilms, their relationship with the colonized
   substratum, and the three-dimensional structure of the biofilms were
   studied by image analysis. The differences between local seasonal
   microenvironments at the Palenque site, the bioreceptivity of stone and
   the relationship between biofilms and their substrata are described. The
   implications for the development and permanence of species capable of
   withstanding temporal heterogeneity in and on El Palacio, mainly due to
   alternating wet and dry seasons, are discussed. Knowledge on how
   different biofilms contribute to biodegradation or bioprotection of the
   substratum can be used to develop maintenance and conservation protocols
   for cultural heritage.},

Title = {Parthenocarpy and Seed Production in Burseraceae},
Booktitle = {DESERT PLANTS: BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {231-239},
Abstract = {Seed production is determined by biotic and abiotic factors; however,
   crop viability can be affected negatively by phenomenon such as
   parthenocarpy (production of seedless fruits). Bursera morelensis is a
   deciduous species endemic to Mexico that occurs in the Tehuacan Valley
   and illustrates the strong effect of parthenocarpy. There is high annual
   variability in the production of fertilized and parthenocarpic fruits.
   In some years, crop yield is greater, and fruit removal and visits by
   birds are higher as compared to a year with poor crops. In mast years,
   parthenocarpy is a factor that helps to attract seed dispersers, which
   also reduces predation by insects and birds. These advantages of
   parthenocarpy probably cannot be observed in years with low fruit
   production but in years with large crops, this phenomenon can help
   maximize profits by increasing plant reproductive success.},

   neutrophils},
Journal = {CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {263},
Number = {1},
Pages = {114-121},
Abstract = {In neutrophils, two receptors for IgG antibodies, namely Fc gamma RIIA
   and Fc gamma RIIIB are constitutively expressed, and a third one, Fc
   gamma RI, can be upregulated by interferon-gamma. Whether Fc gamma RIIIB
   is capable of triggering phagocytosis by itself is still controversial.
   The main role of Fc gamma RI has not been clearly established in these
   cells. To address this problem, neutrophils were treated with
   interferon-gamma, and then phagocytosis mediated by each type of Fc
   gamma receptor was evaluated by flow cytometry. Fc gamma RIIA was the
   most efficient receptor for phagocytosis. Fc gamma RIIIB could mediate
   phagocytosis but much less efficiently than Fc gamma RIIA. Both Fc gamma
   RIIA- and Fc gamma RIIIB-mediated phagocytosis were blocked by
   inhibitors of Src family kinases, Syk, PI 3-K, and ERK. In contrast,
   interferon-gamma-induced Fc gamma RI was not able to mediate
   phagocytosis. Also, Fc gamma RI did not activate ERK in the nucleus, but
   was however able to stimulate an efficient calcium rise. These data show
   that different neutrophil Fc gamma receptors possess different
   phagocytosis capabilities: Fc gamma RIIA and Fc gamma RIIIB, but not Fc
   gamma RI, promote phagocytosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The genus Eleutherodactylus in Cuba has 52 species of frogs that breed
   on land and have direct development. The description of the reproductive
   system, especially the morphology of their gonads, provides data on
   their adaptive radiation. Our objectives are to describe the morphology
   of the ovaries of six species of Eleutherodactylus: E. goini, E.
   planirostris, E. riparius, E. casparis, E. zugi and E. varleyi and find
   some evidence of the role of follicular cells in the process of growth
   of oocytes. Samples of ovaries of adult females were analyzed by light
   microscopy (brightfield and fluorescence) and electronic transmission.
   The results confirm that the morphology of the ovaries of the six
   species is similar to that of other amphibians. We distinguish three
   stages of oocytes in vitellogenesis. The FITC inmunofluorescent staining
   for SR proteins (transcription factors, non-snRNP) showed the presence
   of these factors in the form of a mottled pattern surrounded by a
   diffuse pattern more or widespread in the oocytes, as in the follicular
   cells, which indicates a strong transcriptional activity. This suggests
   the involvement of the follicular cells in the transfer or synthesis of
   the components of the yolk. This speckled pattern is attenuated and may
   even be absent in the nucleus of oocytes and in later stages or
   postvitelogenesis.},

Title = {A New Approach to the Computer Modeling of Amorphous Nanoporous
   Structures of Semiconducting and Metallic Materials: A Review},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {We review our approach to the generation of nanoporous materials, both
   semiconducting and metallic, which leads to the existence of nanopores
   within the bulk structure. This method, which we have named as the
   expanding lattice method, is a novel transferable approach which
   consists first of constructing crystalline supercells with a large
   number of atoms and a density close to the real value and then lowering
   the density by increasing the volume. The resulting supercells are
   subjected to either ab initio or parameterized-Tersoff-based-molecular
   dynamics processes at various temperatures, all below the corresponding
   bulk melting points, followed by geometry relaxations. The resulting
   samples are essentially amorphous and display pores along some of the
   ``crystallographic{''} directions without the need of incorporating ad
   hoc semiconducting atomic structural elements such as graphene-like
   sheets and/or chain-like patterns (reconstructive simulations) or of
   reproducing the experimental processes (mimetic simulations). We report
   radial (pair) distribution functions, nanoporous structures of C and Si,
   and some computational predictions for their vibrational density of
   states. We present numerical estimates and discuss possible applications
   of semiconducting materials for hydrogen storage in potential fuel
   tanks. Nanopore structures for metallic elements like Al and Au also
   obtained through the expanding lattice method are reported.},

   suspensions of non-Brownian particles subjected to an oscillatory shear
   flow is explained by using the Gibbs entropy and the second law of
   thermodynamics. We show that the origin of the transition to
   irreversibility is the coupling between diffusion and inertial forces
   associated to the existence of a velocity gradient in the system. This
   coupling is characterizad by an Onsager coefficient and is responsible
   for the breakdown of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Using lattice
   Boltzmann simulations we characterize the transition through the power
   spectra of particle trajectories.},

Abstract = {Most physics teachers in high school do not teach the atomic quantum
   model because they assume that it is impossible for high school students
   to understand it.
   However, we showed to in-service teachers that although it is not
   convenient to teach the quantum theoretical framework, there is no
   problem discussing with the students the process that took place with
   the actual atomic model. We taught the teachers a way of dealing with
   this theme with high school students.
   Through an educational itinerary, the main atomic models are reviewed
   and analyzed. Each model is accompanied by a brief description of the
   relevant concepts and aspects involved. The strategies for the students
   were designed on the basis of field work with high school students.
   During the course, the steps followed for the strategy are explained in
   detail: planning, structure and organization of the material.
   This proposal took into account the existing curricula in Mexico, as
   well as the population to which it is directed. It was concluded that a
   suitable teaching method of the actual atomic model is possible in high
   school. Teachers appreciated the approach made in the introduction to
   the basic concepts as well as the qualitative work done during the
   course.},

Abstract = {Genomics poses challenges that are specific to historians of science.
   Such challenges are not necessarily met by most recent
   sociologically-oriented approaches This paper argues that historians of
   genomics can draw some lessons from the history of molecular biology, in
   part because some of the actors, concepts, and tools have made a
   transition between the two fields. More importantly, historians face the
   marginalization of scientific fields and actors that played a role in
   the integration of both ultra-disciplines. While biochemistry and
   genetics played an underrated role in the rising of molecular biology,
   research on the molecular evolution of informational molecules
   (molecular phylogenetics) played a neglected but nevertheless central
   role in the development of conceptual and analytical bioinformatics
   tools for genomics. Even today genomic tools incorporate underlying
   assumptions that show their origins in problems of comparative biology.
   This is particularly true in the case of the algorithms for sequence
   alignment, first proposed by Needleman and Wunsch (1970) The present
   essay also makes reference to areas in the history of science that
   require further investigation for an understanding of the
   transformations brought about by genomics to biological research,
   namely, the role of automation - beyond sequencing - and the
   intersection of biology and mathematics.},

Title = {Rational design of a GH1 β-glycosidase to prevent self-condensation

Journal = {PROTEIN ENGINEERING DESIGN \& SELECTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-49},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mutant N282T of a thermostable beta-glycosidase from GH1 family (Tt beta
   Gly) presenting a high transglycosidase activity was previously obtained
   by directed evolution. However, it displays a self-condensation activity
   with the donor 2-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (oNPGal) which
   competes with the condensation reaction and entails undesirable effects.
   In order to prevent this reaction, we rationally modified this enzyme at
   the {[}+1]/{[}+2] subsites so that oNPGal would bind less tightly.
   Molecular modeling (MM) suggested the mutation A221W, which decreased
   the affinity of the donor at these sites and moved it away from the
   bound galactose at the -1 subsite. A single (A221W) and a double mutant
   (A221W/N282T) were constructed, and they gave rise to a drastic decrease
   in self-condensation. The A221W mutant had no transglycosylation
   activity whereas the A221W/N282T mutant still displayed a condensation
   activity, comparable to that of the N282T mutant for the transfer on
   pNPGlcNAc. MM revealed that the double mutant A221W/N282T could induce
   the synthesis of a glycosidic bond between a donor and an acceptor
   displaying an equatorial 4-position. Moreover, it is suggested that
   mutation N282T could change the orientation of residue N219, leading to
   a stabilization of the acceptor with a new hydrogen bond. This finding
   opens the way to further improvements of evolved transglycosidases.},

Abstract = {Pollen limitation is relatively common in plants pollinated by animals,

   production and possible limitation of pollen availability in the

   flowering was abundant (20 to 33\% of the shoots produced flowers
   annually). Fruit production decreased from 86 to 60\% after experimental
   removal of half of the male flowers (estimated pollen: ovule ratio of
   6.7 x 10(4):1) during April 2008. In late April to May 2009, when male
   flowers were less abundant than in the previous year (at a pollen: ovule
   ratio of 3.7 x 10(4):1), artificial pollination resulted in an increase
   in fruit production from 65\% in control flowers to 91\% in the treated
   flowers in the same plot. This study is the first experimental evidence
   of pollen limitation in a dioecious plant with hydrophilous pollination.},

Abstract = {The trabecular bones are highly dispersive acoustic media composed by
   randomly shaped trabeculae (considered as scatterers) and surrounded by
   bone marrow. An acoustic wave generated by an incident ultrasonic pulse
   with respect to the media under study, shows that its velocity and
   amplitude are a function of the density size and shaped of the
   scatterers. Two different methods were used to theoretically study this
   scattering phenomena: i) a self-consistent model proposed by Sabina and
   Willis, and ii) the multiple-scattering theory of Waterman-Truell. These
   methods were able to compute the phase velocity and amplitude as a
   function of operating frequency, density and size of scatterers. The
   theoretical results were compared with experimental data already
   published and the phase veloctiy shows a good agreement for low
   concentration of scatterers.},

Abstract = {The Mesoamerican biological richness is enormous. Within this large
   geographic area are located some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth
   (rain forests), as well as major centers of endemism in the world (cloud
   forests). Countries, such as Guatemala, have large areas of tropical
   rain forest and cloud forest and for this reason it is very important to
   analyze the diversity in this region. Unfortunately, the butterfly fauna
   of Guatemala is poorly known and therefore it is necessary to conduct a
   study and analysis of its composition and diversity. This is the first
   effort in compiling different kinds of information to increase our
   knowledge of the butterflies in Guatemala and the Neotropics. The list
   includes 761 species with records of biological collections, literature,
   field collections, unpublished data, and data bases. Some aspects of the
   diversity, species composition and geographical distribution of the
   butterflies in Guatemala with respect to other geographic units, are
   commented. A historical sketch is also presented. Today, the knowledge
   of the butterflies of this country is rapidly increasing and this is one
   of many on-going studies.},

   spontaneous breaking of parity. We also show that a superselection rule
   operates in the system. Such rule explains some of its peculiarities. We

Abstract = {We studied the intertidal hermit crab Clibanarius antillensis at
   Montepio Beach, Veracruz, Mexico, to determine whether architecture and
   weight of occupied shells varied with the degree of exposure to wave
   action. Data on shell use were obtained from 30-m transects
   perpendicular to the shoreline. The gastropod shells species used by C.
   antillensis were classified into four groups according to their
   morphology: neritiform, conical, turriculate, and turbinate. Neither the
   size nor the weight of hermit crabs varied along transects. A pattern
   showing differential use of shell type according to water velocity was
   detected. neritiform and turriculate shells were the least occupied, and
   their abundance decreased with increasing water velocities. Conical and
   turbinate shells were the most used and their presence increased with
   increasing water velocities. Turbinate and conical shells are heavier
   and have a higher weight/exposed-area ratio than neritiform and
   turriculate shells, so using them at higher energy sites seems to be
   more advantageous than using turriculate shells. The pattern that
   emerges is one in which C. antillensis occupy different shells along the
   intertidal transect, probably due to the advantages that different
   shells may bring, such as minimising drag and the risk of dislodgement.},

   compared with the general area cladograms (GACs) obtained using
   reconciled trees of COMPONENT 2.0 and Brooks Parsimony Analysis (BPA).
   For tree reconciliation, 1 000 trees were saved after the analysis. BPA
   yielded 18 GACs (CI = 0.805, RI = 0.549). The GAC derived from tree
   reconciliation is more or less pectinate and has only 3 groups of 2
   areas each. These groups consist of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts
   as sister areas on the one hand (DCHI, DSON), and the Sierra Madre
   Oriental and Occidental as sister areas oil the other (SMOR, SMOC). This
   latter clade is sister to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran desert clade. The
   third group has the Transvolcanic Belt and Sierra Madre del Sur as
   sister areas (TVA, SMEX). The GAC obtained by BPA showed 4 main groups
   of areas: the first is comprised of the Pacific coast of Mexico and the
   Balsas Depression (PCBAL), the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMEX), and the
   Transvolcanic Belt (TVA); the second group includes the Sierra Madre
   Oriental (SMOR), Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOC), Sonoran (DSON) and
   Chihuahuan deserts (DCHI) the third comprised the Highlands of Chiapas
   and Guatemala (CHIG), the Eastern Lowlands, on the Atlantic coast (ELL)
   and the Semiarid Lands of Tamaulipas-Texas (TAMS); the fourth group
   contains the Western Lowlands, in the Pacific coast (WLL) and northern
   South America (SA); the Talamanca Ridge (TALA) is isolated at the base
   of the 3 first groups. The GAC from narrative biogeography contains 3
   groups: the first has areas of northern Mexico (DSON, DCHI, TAMPS), the
   second has areas from central Mexico (PCBAL, SMOR, SMOC, TVA), and third
   has areas from southern Mexico and Central America (SMEX, CHIG, TALA,
   WLL, ELL, SA). In general, the GAC from the BPA analysis shared more
   groups with the hypothesis of narrative biogeography; when compared to
   the GAC obtained via reconciled trees; however, all the GACs obtained
   are topologically distinct. Accounting for the lack of congruence
   between the narrative biogeography GAC, reconciled tree analysis and
   BPA, is challenging due to several factors: 1), erroneous interpretation
   of vicariant events when constructing the narrative area cladogram; 2),
   lack of congruence among patterns of speciation and endemism for the
   taxa used in this analysis; 3), the region under study is a geologically
   complex zone and the history of the inhabiting biota is equally complex:
   4). there are many widespread species present in this region, and may
   obscure the relationship among the areas of endemism: 5), the patterns
   of endemicity are poorly-defined and -studied in Mexico and Central
   America 6), the incorrect selection of the areas of endemism used in
   this study. Despite these issues the results presented here are evidence
   of the multi-dimensional complexity of historical biogeographical
   processes in the region.},

Abstract = {We studied pedodiversity in mountainous tropical semideciduous forests
   at three key sites in Sierra Madre del Sur, Southern Mexico, at the
   altitudes from 600 to 1400 m a.s.l. Using detailed soil maps, we
   recorded the total number and the areas of soil delineations at each
   site, and calculated the pedodiversity indices. We found that
   pedodiversity increases with an increase in the absolute height within
   the zone of semideciduous forests, and interpreted this phenomenon as an
   evidence for a smaller development of erosion at higher altitudes. The
   areas of soil delineations reach their minimum within the intermediate
   part of this zone, because large delineations of strongly weathered
   clayey soils are developed at the higher altitudes, and large
   delineations of recent soils on strongly eroded surfaces are found at
   the lower altitudes. A conclusion about the need to take into account
   the particular composition of the soil cover upon the interpretation of
   pedodiversity data is made.},

Abstract = {Important aspects of chaotic behaviour appear in systems of low
   dimension, as illustrated by the Logistic Map. It is indeed a remarkable
   fact that all systems that make a transition from order to disorder by
   the period-doubling route, display common properties, irrespective of
   their exact functional form. We discuss preliminary evidence for 1/f
   power spectra in the chaotic time series associated with the Logistic
   Map, as a mathematical model for the dripping faucet that can be seen as
   a paradigm for classical chaos. In the same context, we also consider a
   new experiment with photons that constitutes what we call a ``dripping
   laser{''}. We discuss the possible consequences of these preliminary
   analyses.},

   inoculated with 15,000 eggs and evaluated 15, 45, and 90 days after

   (R) O.C.T. Compound (TM) and 10 mu m-thick sections were cut with a
   Microm HM505N (R) cryostat at -30 degrees C and then stained with basic
   fuschsine-fast green. At 15 dai on both cultivars, nematodes were
   trapped in lignified cavities surrounded by hypertrophied cells. The
   nematodes present were third (J3) and fourth stage juveniles (J4),
   identified by morphological characters, and remained in these stages

Abstract = {Physiological condition and organisms' health which are grown in culture
   systems depends on several factors including water quality, feeding and
   density among others In Mexico, the colonies of the axolotl Ambystoma
   mexicanum (Shaw), an indigenous amphibian under extinction risk, are
   maintained under different culture conditions according to the
   objectives of the colony and the available resources Particularly, water
   electrolytic characteristic and ionic and osmotic conditions are the
   factors with greater variation in the axolotl culture systems Therefore,
   it is necessary to standardize the best maintenance conditions to store
   the germoplasm of the axolotl and to ensure healthy organisms with
   researching purposes. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate
   the development and growth of Ambystoma mexicanum larvae reared under
   different maintenance media, usually used in Mexico for the culture of
   the species. 1) dechlorinated tap water, 2) dechlorinated tap water
   enriched with sodium chloride and commercial colloidal solution and 3)
   Holtfreter's solution reconstructed with dechlorinated tap water In each
   experimental condition, 15 larvae on stage 44 (immediately after
   hatching) were maintained during 21 days and development and growth were
   weekly recorded Ionic and osmotic conditions of the external media were
   routinely registered The obtained results suggested a better
   physiological condition of the axolotls maintained on Holtfreter's
   solution, where the highest growth rate (13 g WW d(-1)) and the greatest
   condition factor (0 79) were registered. The use of this solution is
   recommended due it guarantees the suitable development of early stages
   of A. mexicanum on culture systems},

Abstract = {The differences between measured masses and Liquid Drop Model (LDM)
   predictions have well known regularities, which can be analyzed as a
   two-dimensional texture on the N-Z plane. The remaining microscopic
   effects, obtained after removing the smooth LDM mass contributions, have
   proved difficult to model. They contain all the information related to
   shell closures, nuclear deformation and the residual nuclear
   interactions, and display a well defined pattern. In the present work
   the more than 2000 known nuclear masses are studied as an array in the
   N-Z plane viewed through a mask, behind which the approximately 7000
   unknown unstable nuclei that can exist between the proton and neutron
   drip lines are hidden. Employing a Fourier transform deconvolution
   method these masses can be predicted. The image reconstruction technique
   allows the precise prediction of nuclear masses in the vicinity of the
   region of nuclei with measured masses, improving any reference model.
   Other potential applications of the present approach are outlined.},

Title = {Hadron production in electron-positron annihilation computed from the
   gauge-gravity correspondence},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {80},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We provide a nonperturbative expression for the hadron production in
   electron-positron annihilation at zero temperature in a strongly
   coupled, large-N-c SU(N-c) field theory with N-f < N-c quark flavors.
   The resulting expressions are valid to leading order in the
   electromagnetic coupling constant but nonperturbatively in the SU(N-c)
   interactions and the mass of the quark. We obtain this quantity by
   computing the imaginary part of the hadronic vacuum polarization
   function Pi(q) using holographic techniques, providing an alternative to
   the known method that uses the spectrum of infinitely stable mesons
   determined by the normalizable modes of the appropriated fields in the
   bulk. Our result exhibits a structure of poles localized at specific
   real values of q(2), which coincide with the ones found using the
   normalizable modes, and extends it offering the unique analytic
   continuation of this distribution to a function defined for values of
   q(2) over the complex plane. This analytic continuation permits to
   include a finite decay width for the mesons. By comparison with
   experimental data we find qualitatively good agreement on the shape of
   the first pole, when using the rho meson parameters and choosing a
   proper normalization factor. We then estimate the contribution to the
   anomalous magnetic moment of the muon finding an agreement within 25\%,
   for this choice of parameters.},

Title = {Historical biogeography of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico: a perspective
   from ferns (Monilophyta) and lycopods (Lycophyta)},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {98},
Number = {4},
Pages = {775-786},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based on known data sets and maximum entropy distribution data of fern
   and lycopod species registered in the Yucatan Peninsula, track and
   parsimony analyses were undertaken to evaluate the contribution of these
   groups to the establishment of biogeographical relationships of the
   peninsula with other areas. The resulting generalized tracks clearly
   agree with the geological origin of the peninsula and the previously
   recognized relationship with the Greater Antilles is not supported for
   ferns and lycopods. Instead, a Central American generalized track
   connects the Yucatan Peninsula with south-eastern Mexico and Central
   America. Floristically, the peninsula harbours 66 species of ferns and
   lycopods. Seven are registered for the first time in the Yucatan
   Peninsula and one is a new species for Mexico. These species do not
   follow the latitudinal pattern expected if ecological factors, such as
   humidity and rainfall, were the most important in determining their
   distributions. Groups of areas recognized with parsimony analysis of
   endemicity could not be defined as provinces as a result of the lack of
   endemic species. Nevertheless, a regionalization scheme based on maximum
   entropy distribution data and supported by track analyses is proposed.
   Two separate districts are recognized within the Yucatan Peninsula:
   arid/dry Yucatan in the north and El Peten (humid) in the south. (C)

Title = {Is it possible to characterize the phenotypic space from the

Abstract = {Quantitative relationships among the elements of the body plan of Uta
   stansburiana were analyzed to evaluate their influence on the structure
   and limits of its phenotypic space. A methodology based on conceiving
   organisms as systems was developed. The relations among the elements of
   the body plan are described by a system of simultaneous equations (SES)
   of the type x(i) = mx(j) + b, where x(i) and x(j) are morphometric
   variables, and in and b are constants. This system was employed to
   simulate the phenotypic variation of U. stansburiana and to characterize
   its phenotypic space. The results indicate that the structure and limits
   of the phenotypic space of a taxon are emergent properties of the system
   that constitutes the body plan. These properties can be considered
   internal constraints, which act jointly with natural selection
   generating discontinuous phenotypic spaces. In this paper we propose a
   methodology that defines and analyzes with a systemic approach the
   phenotypic space of a taxon. This may be useful for proposing and
   testing hypothesis related with the causal factors of this space.},

   Many of the 16S- and 18S rRNA gene sequences recovered by DGGE
   fingerprinting analysis were related to phototrophic microbial
   phylotypes of known identity. Our genetic and morphological analysis
   indicated the ubiquitous presence of the microeukaryotic green algae
   Desmodesmus-Scenedesmus spp. and of the unicellular cyanobacteria
   Cyanobium spp. as the most representative populations in the samples.
   While 18S rRNA-DGGE fingerprinting analysis revealed a homogeneous
   community composition across sites and seasons, the 16S rRNA showed
   significant differences between localities and seasons. None of the
   cyanobacteria species with potential to produce toxins were identified
   across the investigated samples. Correlations between biotic and abiotic
   variables evidenced an important difference between the dry and the
   rainy season, with a greater consistency in data from the rainy season.
   According to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a strong relation
   between inorganic nitrogen, species richness, and subaquatic irradiance
   determines environmental variability in Xochimilco. Complementary and
   relevant data in results obtained from microscopy, fingerprinting, and
   statistical analysis applied in ecology indicate that a multifaceted
   approach to the study of microbial communities is necessary to
   accomplish a comprehensive scientific framework and to generate proper
   management strategies.},

Abstract = {During paralarval development of the octopus Robsonella fontaniana, the
   mantle size is reduced in proportion to the total octopus length,
   whereas the organs more directly involved in catching prey tend to
   increase in direct proportion to the total length. A morphometric and
   gravimetric study of R.fontaniana embryos was made in order to determine
   whether the morphometric trends and exponential growth rates observed in
   the planktonic and benthic phases begin during the embryonic
   development. Seven clutches, sampled during different seasons of the
   year, were studied under controlled conditions until hatching of the
   planktonic paralarvae. Yolk reserves and protein content in the
   perivitelline liquid were quantified to determine how the yolk
   absorption and the consumption of perivitelline protein are modulated
   during embryonic development. Results demonstrate that during embryonic
   development the growth rate for total length, mantle length, and arm
   length is exponential, indicating that the type of growth described for
   paralarvae and juveniles begins during embryonic life. The morphometric
   changes and growth are related to an exponential reduction of egg yolk
   and a linear consumption of perivitelline protein.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Sceloporus mucronatus is a viviparous lizard that inhabits high
   altitudes in central Mexico. Lizards from Tecocomulco, Hidalgo, Mexico,
   were collected monthly at 2500 m throughout one year. Macro- and
   microscopic evidence of gonads showed that both sexes reproduce
   synchronously during the fall. In males, after a short testicular
   quiescence in December, the recrudescence begins in inter (January) and
   continues through spring and summer (July), with maximum activity
   occuring from late summer to early fall (August-September). Regression
   takes place simultaneously with copulation during the fall
   (October-November). In females, vitellogenesis occurs during summer and
   fall (August-November), with ovulation in the fall (Novermber-December).
   Gravid females were found throughout the winter, and parturition occurs
   during spring(May). Litter size was correlated with female snout-vent
   length. Female reproductive phenology of viviparous Sceloporus species
   seems to be highly conservative at different altitudes, but male
   reproductive phenology shifts between spring-summer (in populations
   higher than 2500 m) and summer-fall (in populations 2500 m or lower), as
   in the present study. The longer period of testicular recrudescence
   (January-July) in the studied population from Tecocomulco suggests
   plasticity in testicular activity.},

Abstract = {Biochemical changes, specifically in hemocyanin and glucose
   concentrations in hemolymph, glycogen in the digestive gland. were
   studied throughout the molt cycle in juveniles of Litopenaeus vannamei
   in a high salinity condition (36), and related to variations in the
   osmotic capacity of organisms. Increasing hemolymph volume before
   molting modifies circulating glucose and hemocyanin concentrations
   acting on the osmotic capacity. Variations in glucose concentrations are
   indicators of differential energy requirements throughout the molt
   cycle. Hemocyanin was used as an indirect indicator of the energy
   consumed by shrimp in various molt processes that affect the osmotic
   capacity. The co-variability of these metabolites is the result of the
   biochemical adaptations displayed by shrimp to maintain homeostasis.
   Their relation to changes in the osmotic capacity is given as a model to
   understand and predict events associated with molting under hypo-osmotic
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Baleen whales are the largest animals that have ever lived. To develop
   an improved estimation of substitution rate for nuclear and
   mitochondrial DNA for this taxon, we implemented a relaxed-clock
   phylogenetic approach using three fossil calibration dates: the
   divergence between odontocetes and mysticetes similar to 34 million
   years ago (Ma), between the balaenids and balaenopterids similar to 28
   Ma, and the time to most recent common ancestor within the
   Balaenopteridae similar to 12 Ma. We examined seven mitochondrial
   genomes, a large number of mitochondrial control region sequences (219
   haplotypes for 465 bp) and nine nuclear introns representing five
   species of whales, within which multiple species-specific alleles were
   sequenced to account for within-species diversity (1-15 for each locus).
   The total data set represents >1.65 Mbp of mitogenome and nuclear
   genomic sequence. The estimated Substitution rate for the humpback whale
   control region (3.9\%/million years, My) was higher than previous
   estimates for baleen whales but slow relative to other mammal species
   with similar generation times (e.g., human-chimp mean rate > 20\%/My).
   The mitogenomic third codon position rate was also slow relative to
   other mammals (mean estimate 1\%/My compared with a mammalian average of
   9.8\%/My for the cytochrome h gene). The mean nuclear genomic
   substitution rate (0.05\%/My) was substantially slower than average
   synonymous estimate,,, for other mammals (0.21-0.37\%/My across a range
   of studies). The nuclear and mitogenome rate estimates for baleen whales
   were thus roughly consistent with all 8- to 10-fold slowing due to a
   combination of large body size and long generation times. Surprisingly,
   despite the large data set of nuclear intron sequences, there was only
   weak and conflicting Support for alternate hypotheses about the
   phylogeny of balaenopterid whales, suggesting that interspecies
   introgressions or a rapid radiation has obscured species relationships
   in the nuclear genome.},

Abstract = {Herbivorous (20\% vegetable protein, 40\% carbohydrate) and carnivorous
   diets (40\% marine animal protein, 20\% carbohydrate) were
   experimentally tested to assess their effect on the energy balance and
   energetic substrates utilized by postlarvae (PL's /15 days) and juvenile
   shrimp (3-6 g) of Litopenaeus vannamei. Postlarval stage 60 (PL60, early
   juveniles) shrimps fed HeD and CaD diets, then late juveniles (3-6 g)
   acclimated to the same diets were tested for their respective energy
   partitioning potential.
   No significant differences (p>0.05) on growth were obtained in early
   juveniles (mean final wet weight of 0.19 g). However in late juvenile
   stages a significant difference (p<0.05) in growth rate was observed. In
   terms of energy partitioning, both early and late juveniles seem to
   spend more energy in respiratory metabolism than in the elimination of
   excretion products. A change in feed composition based on quality
   protein sources induced some modifications on shrimp's activity measured
   by heat increment. Shrimps fed with an herbivorous diet showed a higher
   heat increment. Interestingly, the early stages of L vannamei display a
   remarkable capacity to assimilate a plant protein-based and a high
   carbohydrate level diet. Such capacity with a stimulation of genes would
   lead to a good adaptation of juveniles receiving all-plant diets to
   sustain growth performances up to a marketable size. The implications of
   these findings for the shrimp farming feeding costs are briefly
   discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An important historical relation that has hardly been addressed is the
   influence of Prosper Lucas's Treatise on Natural Inheritance on the
   development of Charles Darwin's concepts related to inheritance. In this
   article we trace this historical connection. Darwin read Lucas's
   Treatise in 1856. His reading coincided with many changes concerning his
   prior ideas on the transmission and expression of characters. We
   consider that this reading led him to propose a group of principles
   regarding prepotency, hereditary diseases, morbid tendencies and
   atavism; following Lucas, he called these principles: laws of
   inheritance.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have explored the possible utility of ecological niche
   modeling as a tool for species discovery, with promising initial
   results, but no detailed test has as-yet evaluated the success or
   failure rates of the method. We use a comprehensive distributional
   summary for the birds of Mexico to develop a test, in which well-known
   and broadly-distributed species are used to predict the distributional
   areas of poorly-known congener species. The results indicated that all
   of the `unknown' species chosen for testing were predicted significantly
   better than random expectations by the ecological characteristics of at
   least one well-known congener species. These results bode well for
   broader applications of using biodiversity informatics tools to guide
   species discovery, but further testing and development of protocols is
   still needed.},

Abstract = {Increasing degradation of the water quality, caused by overuse and
   salinization, leads to considerable changes of the phytoplankton
   composition in Kenyan Rift Valley lakes. Exemplarily, the phytoplankton
   communities and biomasses of deteriorating freshwater Lake Naivasha and
   salinizing Lake Oloidien were studied between 2001 and 2005, accompanied
   by physico-chemical measurements (pH, total phosphorus and nitrogen,
   alkalinity, conductivity). Over the last three decades, the ecology of
   these two water basins has been subjected to dramatic changes, caused by
   excessive use of water and catchment area by man. In L. Naivasha a shift
   in the dominance of coccoid cyanobacteria towards dominance of
   Chlorophyceae (Botryococcus terribilis) was observed. Lake Oloidien
   exhibited a shift in the dominance of coccoid Chlorophyceae towards
   dominance of cyanobacteria (Arthrospira fusiformis, Anabaenopsis
   elenkinii). Phytoplankton findings and chemical data demonstrate that L.
   Naivasha has developed towards a eutrophic freshwater lake while L.
   Oloidien has progressed towards a hypereutrophic alkaline-saline lake.},

Title = {Areas of endemism of Mexican mammals: reanalysis applying the optimality

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},

Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {468-478},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In order to test Mexican areas of endemism of mammals identified by
   previous parsimony analyses of endemicity (PAEs), we applied the
   optimality criterion to three data matrices (based on point records,
   potential distributional models and the fill option in software NDM). We
   modelled the ecological niches of 429 terrestrial mammal species using
   the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and models were
   projected as potential distributional areas. We overlapped the point
   occurrence data and the individual maps of potential distributions to a
   grid of 1 degrees latitude-longitude. Three matrices of 247 grid cells
   (areas) and 429 species were built: (1) a binary matrix with `0' for
   absence and `1' for presence of at least one record of the species
   inside the grid-cell; (2) a three-state matrix similar to (1) but
   assigning the state `2' to the assumed presence in the model of
   potential distribution; and (3) a three-state matrix similar to (2), but
   applying the fill option of software NDM instead of using a model. The
   optimality criterion was performed in NDM version 2.7 and results were
   examined with VNDM version 2.7. The first and second matrices showed 13
   areas of endemism and the third identified 16 areas of endemism. NDM
   provided a better resolution than PAE, allowing us to identify several
   new areas of endemism, previously undetected. Ecological niche models,
   projected as potential distributional areas, and the optimality
   criterion are very useful to identify areas of endemism, although they
   should be used with caution because they may overpredict potential
   distributional areas. PAE seems to underestimate the areas of endemism
   identified. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal

Title = {Persistence effects in deterministic diffusion},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {80},
Number = {4, 1},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In systems that exhibit deterministic diffusion, the gross parameter
   dependence of the diffusion coefficient can often be understood in terms
   of random-walk models. Provided the decay of correlations is fast
   enough, one can ignore memory effects and approximate the diffusion
   coefficient according to dimensional arguments. By successively
   including the effects of one and two steps of memory on this
   approximation, we examine the effects of ``persistence{''} on the
   diffusion coefficients of extended two-dimensional billiard tables and
   show how to properly account for these effects using walks in which a
   particle undergoes jumps in different directions with probabilities that
   depend on where they came from.},

Title = {Dehydroepiandrosterone inhibits the proliferation and induces the death

Volume = {276},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has a protective role against
   epithelial-derived carcinomas; however, the mechanisms remain unknown.
   We determined the effect of DHEA on cell proliferation, the cell cycle
   and cell death in three cell lines derived from human uterine cervical
   cancers infected or not with human papilloma virus (HPV). We also
   determined whether DHEA effects are mediated by estrogen and androgen
   receptors. Proliferation of C33A (HPV-negative), CASKI (HPV16-positive)
   and HeLa (HPV18-positive) cells was evaluated by violet crystal staining
   and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
   reduction. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the phases of the cell
   cycle, and cell death was detected using a commercially available
   carboxyfluorescein apoptosis detection kit that determines caspase
   activation. DNA fragmentation was determined using the terminal
   deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay.
   Flutamide and ICI 182,780 were used to inhibit androgen and estrogen
   receptors, respectively, and letrozol was used to inhibit the conversion
   of DHEA to estradiol. Our results show that DHEA inhibited cell
   proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the three cell lines; the
   DHEA IC50 doses were 50, 60 and 70 mu M for C33A, CASKI and HeLa cells,
   respectively. The antiproliferative effect was not abrogated by
   inhibitors of androgen and estrogen receptors or by an inhibitor of the
   conversion of testosterone to estradiol, and this effect was associated
   with an increase in necrotic cell death in HPV-negative cells and
   apoptosis in HPV-positive cells. These results suggest that DHEA
   strongly inhibits the proliferation of cervical cancer cells, but its
   effect is not mediated by androgen or estrogen receptor pathways. DHEA
   could therefore be used as an alternative in the treatment of cervical
   cancer.},

Title = {Do the Oaxacan Highlands represent a natural biotic unit? A cladistic
   biogeographical test based on vertebrate taxa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {Aim
   We analysed the distributional patterns of six terrestrial vertebrate
   taxa from the Oaxacan Highlands (Sierra Mazateca, Nudo de Zempoaltepetl
   and Sierra de Juarez) through a cladistic biogeographical approach, in
   order to test their naturalness as a biotic unit.
   Location
   The Oaxacan Highlands, Mexico.
   Methods
   The cladistic biogeographical analysis was based on the area cladograms
   of the Pseudoeurycea bellii species group (Amphibia: Plethodontidae),
   the genus Chlorospingus (Aves: Thraupidae), the genera Microtus,
   Reithrodontomys and Habromys, and the Peromyscus aztecus species group
   (Mammalia: Rodentia). We obtained paralogy-free subtrees, from which the
   components were coded in a data matrix for parsimony analysis. The data
   matrix was analysed with Nona through WinClada.
   Results
   The parsimony analysis resulted in a single general area cladogram in
   which areas were fragmented following the sequence Sierra Madre
   Occidental, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Chiapas, Sierra Madre Oriental
   + Sierra Mazateca, Sierra Madre del Sur, Nudo de Zempoaltepetl and
   Sierra de Juarez.
   Main conclusions
   The general area cladogram shows that the Oaxacan Highlands do not
   constitute a natural unit. The Sierra Mazateca is the sister area to the
   Sierra Madre Oriental, whereas the Nudo de Zempoaltepetl and the Sierra
   de Juarez are closely related to the Sierra Madre del Sur. The events
   that might have caused these patterns include cycles of expansion and
   contraction of mountain pinyon, juniper and oak woodlands during the
   Pleistocene.},

   The maximum magnitude of the brighter components is equal to 9.32. The
   mean error in the separation measurement is 0.03 `' and in the position

   females. Discriminant function analysis yielded correct classification
   as males or females in 95\% of samples analyzed (92.3\% of males and
   100\% of females). Additionally, we identified morphological variables
   which presented the highest correlation to obtain linear regression
   functions for estimating one or more missing variables in specimens. The
   discriminating function developed offers a means of determining the sex
   of individual Ivory-billed Woodcreepers, so this tool is valuable for
   ecological studies and population studies of this species.},

Abstract = {The Rufous-naped Wren (Campylorhynchus rufinucha) is a sedentary,
   morphologically variable species distributed in the dry forests of
   Mesoamerica. It ranges from Colima, Mexico, south to Costa Rica along
   the Pacific slope, with a disjunct population in central Veracruz.
   Populations of two forms on the Pacific slope intergrade in Chiapas,
   Mexico, apparently as a result of secondary contact. We sequenced a
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene to explore phylogeographic patterns and
   hybridization. We found three divergent lineages, two geographically
   spanning the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and a disjunct Veracruz population.
   Analyses of molecular variation and Phi statistics are consistent with
   genetically distinct populations. Morphological and behavioral evidence
   from other studies is consistent with the existence of these three
   independent evolutionary lineages. However, the geographic distribution
   of haplotypes suggests mtDNA introgression east of the isthmus. Our data
   suggest that this secondary contact could be explained by population
   expansions. We recommend recognizing three species, two of which
   hybridize in a narrow contact zone. Received 12 March 2007 accepted 19

Abstract = {Patterns of above- and below-ground biomass allocation in seedlings of
   nine common cloud forest (CF) tree species of western Mexico were
   examined under varying controlled light conditions using artificial
   shade houses. We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth
   and survival) and four morphological traits (SLA, biomass allocation to
   stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent
   differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light
   regime typical of the CF understorey. For all species, traits between
   the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems
   differed among light levels. Five species had the largest SLA in the
   lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum,
   Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only
   species with a large SLA at the highest light level (377.47 cm(2)
   g(-1)). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant
   variation in SLA of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the
   experiment. The relative height growth rates (RHGR) of the seedlings of
   five species were significantly different between light levels (P <
   0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The
   RHGR of three species were correlated positively with SLA. In turn,
   allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated
   with the RHGR of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and
   Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any
   species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P < 0.05) and was
   correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and
   Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the
   highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all
   traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly.
   Our results show that these species display a wide range of resource
   allocation patterns when exposed to the varying light conditions that
   may be found in the forest understorey and highlight the role of
   morphological traits in this variation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Changes in the position along the elevational gradient for plant species

   We explored patterns of seedling survival of Ceiba aesculifolia, a
   tropical tree species, along an altitudinal gradient in a slope facing
   the city of Morelia, in Michoacan, Mexico, because the city has followed
   a trend of increasing mean annual temperatures with a difference of at
   least 4 C when compared with the surrounding rural areas. The highest
   survival was found between 2200 and 2230 m a.s.l. (100\% after 1 year of
   planting and 75\% after 2 years), 160 m higher than the altitudinal
   limit of the remnant adult trees in the study area, and close to the
   highest limit reported for the species at a regional scale (2200 m
   a.s.l.). There was a significant effect of altitude on survival among
   experimental plots (P < 0.0001) and the interaction between elevation
   and distance from the north side of the experimental area was
   significant (P=0.017). For restoring populations of C. aesculifolia
   within our study region, assisted migration through the establishment of
   populations at the elevational limit or higher than its historical range
   might be necessary in areas close to cities that already are under the
   effects of increased temperatures, but might be necessary also in rural
   areas for ameliorating the expected effects of global climate change in
   tropical rural areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We evaluate the performance of two decision tree procedures and four
   Bayesian network classifiers as potential decision support systems in
   the cytodiagnosis of breast cancer. In order to test their performance
   thoroughly, we use two real-world databases containing 692 cases and 322
   cases collected by a single observer and 19 observers, respectively. The
   results show that, in general, there are considerable differences in all
   tests (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PV+, PV- and ROC) when a
   specific classifier uses the single-observer dataset compared to those
   when this same classifier uses the multiple-observer dataset. These
   results suggest that different observers see different things: a problem
   known as interobserver variability. We graphically unveil such a problem
   by presenting the structures of the decision trees and Bayesian networks
   resultant from running both databases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {Land use/land cover change (LULC) is a major threat to natural protected
   areas worldwide. This paper explores the relationships between four
   estimated LULC. parameters for 17 Mexican biosphere reserves (BRs) for
   1993-2002 on a GIS platform, and ten socioeconomic factors obtained from
   census data. These relationships were tested through linear correlations
   and multivariate analysis. BRs showed lower human demographic pressure,
   but higher population dispersion, social marginality, percentage of
   rain-fed agriculture area, and dependence upon agriculture and cattle
   compared to nationwide values. BRs also varied in their indigenous
   population, and showed cattle overpopulation, and low immigration and
   road density. Socioeconomic factors explained 87\% of LULC variation.
   High population and road density cattle overpopulation and low
   percentage indigenous population were related to percentage of
   transformed area (2002). Conversely, small population and road density,
   large proportion of indigenous population and high dependency on
   agriculture and cattle, were related to the rate of change in
   transformed area (1993-2002). High human population growth and urban
   concentration occurred when BRs suffered higher LULC than their
   corresponding ecoregions. Including socioeconomic conditions prevailing
   in BRs and their influence on LULC in reserve management and rural
   development planning will improve strategies for the continence of
   conservation and development goals.},

Abstract = {The treefrog genus Hyla (Anura: Hylidae) consists of at least 31 species
   found in North America, Central America, Europe, and Asia and is the
   only genus of hylids that occurs outside the New World. Despite
   intensive work on the phylogeny of the genus in the past few years,
   several problems still exist regarding relationships within Hyla. These
   problems include the unusual placements of H. gratiosa and H. walkeri in
   some recent studies and the relatively limited taxon sampling of Asian
   species. In the present study, we revisit the phylogeny of Hyla to
   address some of these problems. First, we tested the unexpected
   placements of H. gratiosa and H. walkeri by sampling additional
   individuals of these species. Our results show that the unusual
   placements of H. gratiosa and H. walkeri in previous studies were most
   likely due to a mislabelled tissue sample and a misidentified specimen,
   respectively. Second, we included two species of Asian Hyla not included
   in previous phylogenies. Our study provides additional evidence for two
   separate colonizations of Hyla from the New World into Asia, and
   suggests an unusual biogeographic pattern in the Asian Hyla clades.},

Abstract = {Seed dispersal into fragmented tropical landscapes limits the rate and
   character of ecological succession between forest remnants. In a novel
   experiment in recovery of dispersal between forest remnants, 120 1-m(2)
   seed traps were placed in fenced plots in active pasture 90-250 m from
   forest, and in nearby primary and secondary forests. Total seed rain
   from December 2006 to January 2008 included 69 135 seeds of 57 woody
   species. High richness of seed rain of early-successional trees occurred
   in all habitats, but seed rain of late-successional woody plants was
   much lower into pastures and secondary Forest than into old-growth
   forest. Non-metric ordination analysis further demonstrated high
   movement of late-successional species within and between forest and
   secondary forest, but little movement of species of either forest type
   to pastures. Most Species were dispersed by animals, but most seeds were
   dispersed by wind. A pattern of seed rain biased strongly towards
   wind-dispersed species creates a template for regeneration quite unlike
   that in nearby forest.},

Title = {On the status of the tribes Orthognathini and Rhinostomini (Coleoptera:

Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Number = {2216},
Pages = {57-63},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {A cladistic analysis is performed of the four genera of the tribe
   Orthognathini of the curculionid subfamily Dryophthorinae, specifically
   to assess whether the tribe constitutes a monophyletic group or whether
   the genus Rhinostomus falls outside it into a separate tribe, as
   advocated in some classification systems. The analysis based on 27
   morphological characters revealed that Orthognathini is indeed a
   monophyletic group, with the phylogenetic sequence Rhinostomus (=
   Yuccaborus), Sipalinus, Mesocordylus and Orthognathus. The basal
   position of Rhinostomus with respect to the other genera may warrant
   recognition of a separate subtribe, Rhinostomina, for it. Taxonomic
   synopses of the tribe and subtribes and a key to the genera are
   provided.},

Title = {Carotenoid-based status signaling by females in the tropical
   streak-backed oriole},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1000-1006},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {In many tropical bird species, both males and females maintain elaborate
   plumage traits. Although there is considerable evidence that many male
   plumage traits function as status signals that convey information about
   fighting ability, less is known about status signaling in females. We
   tested whether the carotenoid-based orange breast coloration of the
   female streak-backed oriole (Icterus pustulatus pustulatus) signals
   status during territorial interactions. To do this, we simulated
   territorial intrusions using taxidermic models and compared the roles of
   the sexes within pairs during territorial defense directed toward
   different types of simulated intruders. Females were more territorial
   than their mates during the breeding season, whereas males were more
   territorial than their mates in the nonbreeding season, contrary to
   patterns seen in studies of temperate zone birds. The coloration of
   simulated female intruders also influenced territorial responses: When
   presented with color-augmented female models, females responded with
   greater intensity than their mates, whereas the intensity of defense was
   similar for both sexes when presented with average-colored female
   models. The greater female response to more colorful intruders suggests
   that females perceive more ornamented females as greater threats to
   their territorial tenure or to their pair bond. These results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that female carotenoid-based coloration
   signals status in this species.},

Title = {Reproductive Activity of Three Sympatric Viviparous Lizards at Omiltemi,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-420},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We studied the reproductive characteristics of sympatric populations of
   Sceloporus formosus scitulus, Sceloporus omiltemanus (Phrynosomatidae),
   and Mesaspis gadovii (Anguidae) at the Omiltemi forest reserve
   (Guerrero, Mexico). Males are larger and reach larger body sizes at
   reproductive maturity and are more colorful than females in both
   Sceloporus, whereas males are smaller than females and reach sexual
   maturity at similar body sizes in M. gadovii. These species are single
   brooded and follow a common pattern of annual reproductive activity. The
   reproductive activity of females and males of the three species is
   seasonal; vitellogenesis is initiated in late summer and continues in
   autumn/rainy season, gestation occurs throughout the winter/dry season,
   and parturition occurs in early spring. All three species have
   intersexual synchrony in reproductive activity. In spite of similar
   reproductive schedules, some subtle features related to the length of
   each of the reproductive stages could be observed. Sceloporus formosus
   scitulus has a more extended reproductive season, and large females
   start vitellogenesis earlier than do small ones. Males have a prolonged
   reproductive activity and a short nonreproductive season. In contrast,
   the reproductive cycle of the other two species is defined by shorter
   reproductive season and less intrasexual asynchrony for both sexes than
   found in S. f. scitulus. The seasonal pattern of reproduction shared by
   these three species is characteristic of other viviparous lizards at
   high elevations in tropical and subtropical latitudes of Central and
   South America, being convergent for different lizard families. This
   convergence in reproductive patterns suggests a common evolutionary
   response to environmental factors associated with montane habitats,
   whereas specific differences observed within species are attributed to
   the particular evolutionary history of each taxon.},

Title = {Towards Identification of the Mechanisms of Action of Parasite-Derived
   Peptide GK1 on the Immunogenicity of an Influenza Vaccine},
Journal = {CLINICAL AND VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1338-1343},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the synthetic peptide GK1, derived from
   Taenia crassiceps cysticerci, enhances the immunogenicity of the
   commercial inactivated influenza vaccine Fluzone in both young and aged
   mice. In particular, antibody responses were much improved. Since GK1 is
   a peptide and is rapidly cleared from the body, it offers the
   possibility to improve vaccine performance without undesirable effects.
   This study was therefore designed to understand the mechanisms of action
   involved in the adjuvant properties of GK1. For this, transgenic mice
   expressing a T-cell receptor specific for an epitope from the influenza
   virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein were employed. The GK1 peptide
   significantly increased the in vivo proliferative response of
   HA-specific CD4(+) T cells when it was coimmunized with the HA epitope.
   Dendritic cells treated in vitro with GK1 were capable of enhancing
   T-cell activation. Furthermore, in synergy with lipopolysaccharide, GK1
   enhanced the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II and
   costimulatory molecules of dendritic cells and promoted the secretion of
   proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines upon antigen-driven T-cell
   interaction. These data provide important insights into the mechanism
   that underlies the GK1 adjuvant capacity observed previously and
   underline the feasibility of using the transgenic mouse model described
   herein as a tool for investigation of the modes of action of different
   influenza vaccine adjuvants.},

Year = {2009},

Abstract = {We study coupled transport in the nonequilibrium stationary state of a
   model consisting of independent random walkers, moving along a
   one-dimensional channel, which carry a conserved energy-like quantity,
   with density and temperature gradients imposed by reservoirs at the ends
   of the channel. In our model, walkers interact with other walkers at the
   same site by sharing energy at each time step, but the amount of energy
   carried does not affect the motion of the walkers. We find that already
   in this simple model long-range correlations arise in the nonequilibrium
   stationary state which are similar to those observed in more realistic
   models of coupled transport. We derive an analytical expression for the
   source of these correlations, which we use to obtain semi-analytical
   results for the correlations themselves assuming a local-equilibrium
   hypothesis. These are in very good agreement with results from direct
   numerical simulations.},

Abstract = {A physical interpretation is given to a curious ``hump{''} that develops
   in the chemical potential as a function of absolute temperature in an
   ideal Fermi gas for any spatial dimensionality d<2, integer or not, in
   contrast with the more familiar monotonic decrease for all d >= 2. The
   hump height increases without limit as d decreases to zero. The
   divergence at d=0 is shown to be a clear manifestation of the Pauli
   Exclusion Principle whereby two spinless fermions cannot sit on top of
   each other in configuration space. The hump itself is thus an obvious
   precursor of this manifestation, otherwise well understood in momentum
   space. It also constitutes an ``ideal quantum dot{''} when d=0.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the impact of seasonal variations on the
   dynamics of West Nile Virus infection. We are interested in the
   generation of new epidemic peaks starting from an endemic state. In many
   cases, the oscillations generated by seasonality in the dynamics of the
   infection are too small to be observable. The interplay of this
   seasonality with the epidemic oscillations can generate new outbreaks
   starting from the endemic state through a mechanism of parametric
   resonance. Using experimental data we present specific cases where this
   phenomenon is numerically observed.},

Abstract = {A biogeographical regionalization is a hierarchical system to categorize
   geographic areas in terms of their biotas. This hierarchy involves the
   levels of realm, region, dominion, province and district, with province
   being the basic level. Many regionalizations have been proposed to
   categorize biogeographic areas. Some of them are based oil the total
   similarity of their biota; however, the identification of patterns of
   geographic homology (through the search for successively nested areas of
   endemism) is a basic requirement for proposing schemes of natural
   regionalizations. In this paper, I describe the main concepts and
   methods to identify biogeographical patterns used to build natural
   biogeographical regionalizations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a deterministic model for monitoring the impact of
   drug resistance on the transmission dynamics of malaria in a human
   population. The model has a disease-free equilibrium, which is shown to
   be globally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain threshold quantity,
   known as the effective reproduction number, is less than unity. For the
   case when treatment does not lead to resistance development, the model
   has a wild strain-only equilibrium whenever the reproduction number of
   the wild strain exceeds unity. It is shown, using linear and nonlinear
   Lyapunov functions, coupled with the LaSalle Invariance Principle, that
   this equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable for a special case.
   The model has a resistant strain-only equilibrium, which is
   globally-asymptotically stable whenever its reproduction number is
   greater than unity and exceeds that of the wild strain. In this case,
   the two strains undergo competitive exclusion, where the strain with the
   higher reproduction number displaces the other. Further, for the case
   when treatment does not lead to resistance development, the model can
   have no coexistence equilibrium or a continuum of coexistence
   equilibria. When treatment leads to resistance development, the model
   can have a unique coexistence equilibrium or a resistant-only
   equilibrium. This coexistence equilibrium is shown to be
   locally-asymptotically stable, using a technique based on Krasnoselskii
   sub-linearity argument. Numerical simulations of the model show that for
   high treatment rates, the resistant strain can dominate, and drive out,
   the wild strain. Finally, when the two strains co-exist, the proportion
   of individuals with the resistant strain at steady-state decreases with
   increasing rate of resistance development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The Red-bellied Woodpecker species group (Melanerpes carolinus and
   relatives) is composed of five morphologically similar species whose
   limits have been unclear. The relationship of the Golden-fronted
   Woodpecker (M aurifrons) to the remainder of the group is particularly
   uncertain. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences to examine the phylogeny
   of this group and its close relatives. We sequenced 872 bp, including
   fragments of the genes for ND2, ND3, COIII, and tRNAmet, of 11 species
   of Melanerpes. We constructed trees from combined sequences by using the
   maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches. We found that M.
   aurifrons is not monophyletic but rather consists of two clades, one
   comprising tropical populations (M. santacruzi), the other, consisting
   of northern populations, being sister to M. carolinus. The Caribbean
   species, M. superciliaris, is sister to the carolinus-aurifrons clade.
   The group as a whole appears to have diversified into multiple lineages
   in response to several episodes of vicariance, perhaps associated with
   glacial-interglacial cycles. As a result of these findings, major
   taxonomic changes in the group are needed.},

Abstract = {Wild edible mushrooms are non timber forest products whose sustainable
   use must have an ecological basis. In this work, we measured the
   availability of 81 edible mushrooms by means of their abundance,
   frequency, biomass production, temporal and spatial distribution of
   their fruiting bodies. These variables were integrated into an
   ecological importance index (IV) which describes sporome availability in
   the forest. The research was carried out during 2001 and 2002 in the
   Pinus-Quercus forests of Ixtlan de Juarez, Oaxaca. The most abundant
   species were Laccaria laccata var. pallidifolia, Gymnopus confluens and
   Laccaria vinaceobrunnea. Laccaria laccata var. pallidifolia was the most
   productive species with an estimated total productivity of 2.21
   Kg/sampling site. Only G. confluens and G. dryophilus were observed in
   all sampling dates, from June to October. Species with the highest total
   availability were L. laccata var. pallidifolia, G. confluens, L.
   vinaceobrunnea and H. purpurascens. In the communal property of Ixtlan,
   wild edible mushroom diversity is high (96 species); however, their
   availability is heterogeneous (from L. laccata var. pallidifolia IV =
   0.7905, to Helvella infula IV = 0.0055). Within the forest, between
   sites relatively close to one another, species composition was different
   and their abundance and productivity were contrasting.},

Title = {Differential mortality drives life-history evolution and population
   dynamics in the fish Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {90},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2243-2252},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that populations experiencing different
   levels of extrinsic mortality will evolve divergent reproductive
   strategies. Previous work in the live-bearing fish Brachyrhaphis
   rhabdophora shows that individuals from populations that occur with
   piscivorous fish mature earlier and at smaller sizes and have more and
   smaller offspring than fish from populations without predators. However,
   until now, there have been no data to demonstrate that differences in
   mortality rates actually exist between predator and predator-free sites.
   Here we present the results of a serial mark-recapture field study
   designed to estimate mortality rates in natural populations of B.
   rhabodophora from Costa Rica. We found that fish from predator
   environments experience higher overall mortality rates and
   proportionally higher adult mortality rates than fish from predator-free
   environments. We then ask what impact differences in mortality rates
   have on B. rhabdophora population dynamics. Using a population matrix
   modeling approach, we found that B. rhabdophora that co-occur with
   predators have population growth rates similar to those without
   predators and both have confidence intervals that span lambda = 1.0.
   However, elasticity analysis revealed that the most important
   life-history stages for population growth in predator environments are
   found early in life and include growth through early ontogenetic stages
   and survival as small adults; in contrast, the most important
   life-history stages for population growth in predator-free environments
   occur late in life, including survival once large juvenile and adult
   stages are reached. Hence, we demonstrate two important links between
   predation and population demography, one ecological due to the direct
   impacts of predator-induced mortality and the other expressed through
   predator-mediated reproductive adaptation.},

Abstract = {Two glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) cDNA sequences encoding 474 (GDH A, a
   truncated gene) and 552 amino acids (GDH B) were discovered in the
   Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. Both GDH A and GDH B were
   fairly conserved as shown by the amino acid alignment. The two cDNAs
   differed only at the C-terminal sequences. The quantitative real time
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was developed to estimate the
   specific expression on different tissues. Both GDH A and B were mainly
   expressed in shrimp muscle, followed by in the gill and epithelium,
   while the expression in shrimp hepatopancreas was the lowest when
   compared with other tissues. Though no significant difference was
   observed among all the test tissues, the ratio of GDH B to GDH A
   transcription was kept at a very high level ranging from 32.04 in the
   eyestalk to 64.52 in the muscle, indicating that GDH B wits largely
   expressed in Lvannamei. The GDH activity in the muscle of Lvannamei wits
   also the highest followed by in the epithelium, eyestalk and gill. The
   GDH activity in hepatopancreas was significantly lower than that in
   other tissues. As it control, the tissue expression of Na+-K+ ATPase was
   also determined. This enzyme was mainly expressed in the gill, followed
   by in the muscle and epithelium. Our results provide baseline data in
   physiological expressions of GDH and Na+-K+ ATPase for osmoregulation in
   Lvannamei. The research protocol offers a practical guideline for the
   analysis of gene expression in shrimp. The sequences and techniques
   developed in this study will also contribute to the GDH gene research in
   other crustacean species.},

   the idea, widespread in the past and current today In recent decades
   there was a significant boost in different areas of cultural activity in

Abstract = {In 2007 the Systematic and Evolutionary Biogeographical Association
   (SEBA) wrote and ratified the first draft of the International Code of
   Area Nomenclature (ICAN), which was posted subsequently on the SEBA
   website. The ICAN was published, along with an explanatory discussion,
   by Ebach et al. (Journal of Biogeography, 35, 2008, 1153-1157), an
   article that is the subject of criticism by Zaragueta-Bagils et al.
   (Journal of Biogeography, 36, 2009, 1617-1618). We welcome discussion of
   the issues raised by these authors and respond to them briefly here. For
   many reasons, we reject the proposition that implementation of the ICAN
   be postponed until it is flawless. The ICAN has already been
   implemented. Further, it is the nature of nomenclatural codes to be
   proposed and then revised periodically to suit our applications. Most
   importantly, standardization of area names in biogeography is long
   overdue.},

Journal = {ANDAMIOS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Pages = {205+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the eighties, Mexico vacillated between two political regimes: one,
   statist, populist, and authoritarian, and the other neoliberal,
   technocratic, and less authoritarian. The interest of powerful business
   groups, Mexican and foreign, who adopted neoliberal dogma, was
   sufficient to install Carlos Salinas de Gortari, via the ``new{''}
   Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in the presidency in a
   fraudulent election in 1988. The technocracy, first with the PRI and
   later with the Partido de Accion Nacional (PAN), grabbed power and
   retained it, carrying out a coup d'etat ex ante against Andres Manuel
   Lopez Obrador to keep him from winning the presidency in 2006. The
   reason is not hard to understand: this candidacy represented something
   that the power elites were not willing to concede: that the new regimen
   would be toppled to return. to one with more state intervention and
   protection of national sovereignty, especially in maters of control of
   energy resources.
   The dilemma of the two overlapping regimes was resolved, with scams and
   frauds, from the upper echelons of power, in favor of technocratic
   neoliberalism, under the control of the right-wing PAN since 2000. The
   major problem is that the center-left party of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and
   Lopez Obrador, doesn't seem to be up to the historical challenge that it
   faces.},

Title = {Revealing the high-resolution three-dimensional network of chromatin and
   interchromatin space: A novel electron-microscopic approach to
   reconstructing nuclear architecture},
Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {801-810},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The nuclear architecture is considered an important contributor to
   genome function. Although the fine structural features of the cell
   nucleus have been investigated extensively by means of ultrastructural
   cytochemistry, mainly on ultrathin sections in two dimensions (2D),
   there was a of lack routine methods for a rapid reconstruction of
   three-dimensional (3D) distribution of different structural constituents
   throughout the nuclear volume. We have now filled this gap by the
   application of a novel approach associating a pre-embedding selective
   visualization of nuclear components with a method making use of
   ultramicrotomy combined with scanning electron microscopy (microtome
   serial block face scanning electron microscopy-'3View'). We have been
   able to apply this method to the study of DNA distribution within the
   nuclear volume and reconstruction of 3D chromatin arrangement in nuclei
   of rat hepatocytes and endothelial cells. Our observations demonstrate
   that while chromatin appears to occupy the interior of nuclei rather
   sparsely on 2D images, once reconstructed in 3D from a series of
   sequential 2D images it gives the impression of considerably filling the
   nuclear volume. However, quantitative evaluation of the nuclear volume
   occupied by DNA in the above two types of nuclei leaves a significant
   part to the interchromatin space (66.2\% for hepatic cells and 41.7\%
   for endothelial cells, including nuclear space occupied by nucleoli).
   Detailed analysis of the reconstructed nuclei reveals a high degree of
   superposition of chromatin domains, giving rise to a false impression
   that they fill a much larger part of the nuclear volume than they really
   do. Our results show the importance of the contribution of such
   reconstruction techniques to our understanding of the nuclear
   architecture.},

Abstract = {In order to identify the specific role of humoral lectins in
   crustaceans' immune response, we evaluated the effect of the 291 kDa
   hemocyanin-like lectin from Litopenaeus setiferus (LsL) on its own
   hemocytes. LsL binds 5.6\% of circulating non-activated hemocytes, but
   is able to recognize 85\% of total adhered (activated) hemocytes,
   showing filipodia and pseudopodia, inducing the production of reactive
   oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in a time- and dose-dependent manner (100
   ng/10(5) cells/20 min). This effect was inhibited specifically by
   N-acetylated sugars (NeuAc, GalNAc or GlcNAc), as well as by superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), acetylsalicylic, and mefenamic acid. In hemocytes, LsL
   also induced higher ROIs production than Zymozan (p>0.05). The receptor
   for LsL in the hemocytes membrane is a glycoprotein of 61 and 52 kDa per
   subunit, as determined by western blot. Our results suggest that LsL
   participates in the activation of oxidative immune responses of granular
   hemocytes induced by NADPH and other oxidative pathways through a
   specific membrane receptor. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {We study the dynamics of billiard models with a modified collision rule:
   the outgoing angle from a collision is a uniform contraction, by a
   factor lambda, of the incident angle. These pinball billiards
   interpolate between a one-dimensional map when lambda = 0 and the
   classical Hamiltonian case of elastic collisions when lambda = 1. For
   all lambda < 1, the dynamics is dissipative, and thus gives rise to
   attractors, which may be periodic or chaotic. Motivated by recent
   rigorous results of Markarian et al
   (http://premat.fing.edu.uy/papers/2008/110.pdf and
   http://www.preprint.impa.br/Shadows/SERIE\_A/2008/614.html), we
   numerically investigate and characterize the bifurcations of the
   resulting attractors as the contraction parameter is varied. Some
   billiards exhibit only periodic attractors, some only chaotic attractors
   and others have coexistence of the two types.},

Abstract = {Ecological niche models and patterns of richness and endemism of the
   southern Andean genus Eurymetopum (Coleoptera, Cleridae). Eurymetopum is
   an Andean clerid genus with 22 species. We modeled the ecological niches
   of 19 species with Maxent and used them as potential distributional maps
   to identify patterns of richness and endemicity. All modeled species
   maps were overlapped in a single map in order to determine richness. We
   performed an optimality analysis with NDM/VNDM in a grid of 1((sic))
   latitude-longitude in order to identify endemism. We found a highly rich
   area, located between 32((sic)) and 41((sic)) south latitude, where the
   richest pixels have 16 species. One area of endemism was identified,
   located in the Maule and Valdivian Forest biogeographic provinces, which
   extends also to the Santiago province of the Central Chilean subregion,
   and contains four endemic species (E. parallelum, E. prasinum, E.
   proteus, and E. viride), as well as 16 non-endemic species. The sympatry
   of these phylogenetically unrelated species might indicate ancient
   vicariance processes, followed by episodes of dispersal. Based oil our
   results, we suggest a close relationship between these provinces, with
   the Maule representing a complex area.},

Abstract = {The scaling of metabolic rates with body mass is one of the best known
   and most studied characteristics of aquatic animals. Herein, we studied
   how size is related to oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion, and
   ingestion rates in tropical (Octopus maya) and cold-water (Enteroctopus
   megalocyathus) cephalopod species in an attempt to understand how size
   affects their metabolism. We also looked at how cephalopod metabolisms
   are modulated by temperature by constructing the relationship between
   metabolism and temperature for some benthic octopod species. Finally, we
   estimated the energy balance for O. maya and E. megalocyathus in order
   to validate the use of this information for aquaculture or fisheries
   management. In both species, oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion
   increased allometrically with increasing body weight (BW) expressed as Y
   = aBW (b) . For oxygen consumption, b was 0.71 and 0.69 for E.
   megalocyathus and O. maya, respectively, and for ammonia excretion it
   was 0.37 and 0.43. Both species had low O/N ratios, indicating an
   apparent dependence on protein energy. The mean ingestion rates for E.
   megalocyathus (3.1 +/- A 0.2\% its BW day(-1)) and O. maya (2.9 +/- A
   0.5\% its BW day(-1)) indicate that voracity, which is characteristic of
   cephalopods, could be independent of species. The scope for growth (P =
   I - (H + U + R) estimated for E. megalocyathus was 28\% higher than that
   observed in O. maya (320 vs. 249 kJ day(-1) kg(-1)). Thus, cold-water
   cephalopod species could be more efficient than tropical species. The
   protein and respiratory metabolisms of O. maya, E. megalocyathus, and
   other octopod species are directly dependent on temperature. Our results
   offer complementary evidence that, as Clarke (2004) stated, the
   metabolic response (R and U) cannot be determined mechanistically by
   temperature, as previously proposed (Gillooly et al. 2002).},

Abstract = {The firing of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons is vital for normal
   sleep-wake transitions, but its molecular determinants are not well
   understood. It was recently proposed that TASK (TWIK-related
   acid-sensitive potassium) channels {[}TASK1 (K(2P)3.1) and/or TASK3
   (K(2P)9.1)] regulate neuronal firing and may contribute to the
   specialized responses of orexin neurons to glucose and pH. Here we
   tested these theories by performing patch-clamp recordings from orexin
   neurons directly identified by targeted green fluorescent protein
   labelling in brain slices from TASK1/3 double-knockout mice. The
   deletion of TASK1/3 channels significantly reduced the ability of orexin
   cells to generate high-frequency firing. Consistent with reduced
   excitability, individual action potentials from knockout cells had lower
   rates of rise, higher thresholds and more depolarized
   after-hyperpolarizations. However, orexin neurons from TASK1/3 knockout
   mice retained typical responses to glucose and pH, and the knockout
   animals showed normal food-anticipatory locomotor activity. Our results
   support a novel role for TASK genes in enhancing neuronal excitability
   and promoting high-frequency firing, but suggest that TASK1/3 subunits
   are not essential for orexin cell responses to glucose and pH.},

Abstract = {Recently, the importance of fungal resources has been brought to the
   forefront due to their ecological and economical importance. There have
   been many efforts to record their diversity at local and regional
   scales. However, few studies deal with the potential value of fungi for
   the development of local communities, particularly in developing
   countries. The present study presents the results of a five-year
   inventory of useful mushrooms in the communal land of Ixtlan de Juarez,
   Oaxaca. We use the species list to analyze the real possibility of local
   communities incorporating these resources into a model of local
   development exploiting wood and non-wood forest products in the context
   of Smart wood certification. The model discusses three main strategies
   for mushroom management (diversification of forest exploitation,
   incorporation of soil function to forestry and fungal technology
   development): in each case we also discuss the viability and
   infrastructure necessary to implement it. We identified a total of 159
   taxa of useful mushrooms and provide information on their habit,
   substrate, abundance and recorded use. Thirteen taxa were Ascomycetes
   and 146 Basidiomycetes: belonging to 42 families and 73 genera. A total
   of 38 taxa (23.9\%) were new records for the state of Oaxaca. This is,
   to date, the most comprehensive list of useful mushrooms presented in
   Mexico. It demonstrates the huge mycological diversity of these
   resources present in the Juarez' Mountain Range. A total of 113 species
   are edible, 38 species have direct applications in forest management, 19
   species have medicinal properties, 12 are toxic and 12 species have
   recorded biotechnological applications. The diversity and heterogeneity
   of potential uses of these resources represent a challenging opportunity
   for local communities. Product diversification is a fundamental strategy
   to integrate a model of sustainable forest exploitation. We concluded
   that communities developing forestry activities must be aware of the
   functional properties of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi to
   include them in their own forest management plans. We also outline a set
   of common steps for initiating sustainable and diversified forestry
   practices which include: awareness-raising targeted to local authorities
   and forestry technicians on the ecological importance of mushrooms:
   illustrated catalogues on useful species accessible to all the
   communities, which would allow taxonomic identification for all species:
   local technical capacity to obtain and disseminate strains of
   mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi; obtaining resources to develop
   infrastructure to cultivate mushrooms, among many others projects. (C)

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal lung
   disorder of unknown etiology. IPF is likely the result of complex
   interrelationships between environmental and host factors, although the
   genetic risk factors are presently uncertain. Because we have found that
   some MHC polymorphisms confer susceptibility to IPF, in the present
   study we aimed to evaluate the role of the MHC class I chain-related
   gene A (MICA) in the risk of developing the disease. MICA molecular
   typing was done by reference strand mediated conformation analysis in a
   cohort of 80 IPF patients and 201 controls. In addition, the lung
   cellular source of the protein was examined by immunohistochemistry, the
   expression of the MICA receptor NKG2D in lung cells by flow cytometry
   and soluble MICA by ELISA. A significant increase of MICA{*}001 was
   observed in the IPF cohort (OR = 2.91, 95\% CI = 1.04-8.25; pC = 0.03).
   Likewise, the frequency of the MICA{*}001/{*}00201 genotype was
   significantly increased in patients with IPF compared with the healthy
   controls (OR = 4.72, 95\% CI = 1.15-22.51; pC = 0.01). Strong
   immunoreactive MICA staining was localized in alveolar epithelial cells
   and fibroblasts from IPF lungs while control lungs were negative.
   Soluble MICA was detected in 35\% of IPF patients compared with 12\% of
   control subjects (P = 0.0007). The expression of NKG2D was significantly
   decreased in gamma delta T cells and natural killer cells obtained from
   IPF lungs. These findings indicate that MICA polymorphisms and abnormal
   expression of the MICA receptor NKG2D might contribute to IPF
   susceptibility.},

Journal = {PHYSICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2009},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Quantum phase transitions and observables of interest of the ground
   state in the Tavis-Cummings model are analyzed, for any number of atoms,
   by using a tensorial product of coherent states. It is found that this
   `trial' state constitutes a very good approximation to the exact quantum
   solution, in that it globally reproduces the expectation values of the
   matter and field observables. These include the population and dipole
   moments of the two-level atoms and the squeezing parameter. Agreement in
   the field-matter entanglement and in the fidelity measures, of interest
   in quantum information theory, is also found. The analysis is carried
   out in all three regions defined by the separatrix, which gives rise to
   the quantum phase transitions. It is argued that this agreement is due
   to the Gaussian structure of the probability distributions of the
   constant of motion and the number of photons. The expectation values of
   the ground state observables are given in analytic form, and the change
   of the ground state structure of the system when the separatrix is
   crossed is also studied.},

Abstract = {The distribution of cacti species that inhabit the Sierra Madre Oriental
   (SMO) was analysed. Grid-cells were analysed using parsimony analysis of
   endemicity (PAE) and endemism indices. Areas characterized by their
   diagnostic species were determined, aiming to propose areas for the
   conservation of threatened cacti. Distributional data were obtained from
   1936 herbarium specimens, electronic information, and from field
   collections. Eight areas of endemism and three main clades were obtained
   from the grid-cell analysis. Areas obtained from the endemism indices
   are very similar to those obtained with the PAE, but differ in the
   association of grid-cells. PAE showed endemism patterns indicating that
   southern and central sections of the SMO province are the areas richest
   in geographically-restricted species. The results obtained with
   different endemism indices detected more or less the same areas,
   although the importance level is different. The corrected weighted
   endemism index can be considered as a reliable measure of endemism
   because it is unrelated to species richness. A regionalization of the
   SMO in three subprovinces is suggested, supported by characteristic
   cacti taxa and the existence of natural barriers. (C) 2009 The Linnean

Abstract = {The diet of frozen grass shrimp (P. varians) was compared to similar
   grass shrimp that had suffered either boiling, drying at 60A degrees C,
   or freeze-drying by lyophilization at -40A degrees C. In experiment 1,
   cuttlefish fed the frozen shrimp were significantly larger (P < 0.05) at
   the end of 10 days and at the end of the experiment, compared with those
   fed the boiled or dried shrimp. Growth rates were also higher for
   cuttlefish fed the frozen shrimp, compared with the remaining two.
   Growth rates were also higher for cuttlefish fed the frozen shrimp,
   compared with the remaining two. In experiment 2, there were no
   differences in weight (P > 0.05) between cuttlefish fed the frozen or
   the freeze-dried shrimp, whereas cuttlefish fed the dried shrimp were
   smaller at the end of the experiment. Growth rates of cuttlefish fed the
   dried shrimp were lower, compared with those for cuttlefish fed the
   frozen and freeze-dried shrimp, with no significant differences (P >
   0.05) between them. Cuttlefish fed freeze-dried and frozen shrimp showed
   a higher trypsin activity compared to animals fed boiled and dry (60A
   degrees C) shrimp. A higher proportion of absorbed energy was channelled
   into biomass production in animals fed frozen and freeze-dried shrimp
   (56\% and 43\%, respectively) than for animals fed oven-dried (60A
   degrees C) or boiled shrimp. The heat treatment suffered by the shrimp,
   either dry or wet, negatively affected diet quality, probably due to
   denaturation, and loss (by boiling) of proteins and amino acids.
   Additionally, the heating processes may have oxidized the lipids to a
   large extent, contributing to the loss of the polar lipids
   (polyunsaturated fatty acids), which are essential for cephalopods as
   for other organisms. Freeze-drying by lyophilization (negative
   temperatures) did not affect the nutritional quality of the shrimp.},

Abstract = {The motion of a failing drop whose mass grows by accretion is studied
   with canonical methods. This approach requires the introduction of
   S-equivalent non natural Lagrangians. That is, we have to consider
   Lagrangians that give rise to equations of motion that are riot exactly
   the same as the equations of interest, but anyway they share the same
   solutions. We study three examples of laws of accretion: mass growing
   linearly with time, mass growing linearly with the surface of the drop,
   and mass growing proportionally to the product of surface and velocity
   of the drop. In all cases we recover the results obtained by means of
   the Newtonian methods, which we expose in table I.},

Abstract = {Phytoplasmal infections cause loss in yield, quality and germination of
   tubers. Hydrogen peroxide and antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and
   dehydroascorbate are implicated in signaling against stress. The effects
   of these chemicals on minituber yield, sprouting and starch content were
   evaluated in plants testing positive for phytoplasma. Without chemical
   treatment, positive plants showed significant reductions in leaf
   pigments, tuber weights and starch contents, compared to uninfected
   controls, and had more minitubers though fewer sprouted. Hydrogen
   peroxide and antioxidant treatments of positive plants significantly
   reduced the number of minitubers, while enhancing their weights and
   starch contents, and increased the percentage of sprouting minitubers,
   while leaf pigment content also increased. This research demonstrates
   potential benefits of hydrogen peroxide and antioxidants in enhancing
   the yield and quality of tubers not destined for seed in phytoplasma

Title = {Timing major conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear genes in species
   relationships of Polygonia butterflies (Nymphalidae: Nymphalini)},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: Major conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear genes in
   estimating species relationships is an increasingly common finding in
   animals. Usually this is attributed to incomplete lineage sorting, but
   recently the possibility has been raised that hybridization is important
   in generating such phylogenetic patterns. Just how widespread ancient
   and/or recent hybridization is in animals and how it affects estimates
   of species relationships is still not well-known.
   Results: We investigate the species relationships and their evolutionary
   history over time in the genus Polygonia using DNA sequences from two
   mitochondrial gene regions (COI and NDI, total 1931 bp) and four nuclear
   gene regions (EF-1 alpha, wingless, GAPDH and RpS5, total 2948 bp). We
   found clear, strongly supported conflict between mitochondrial and
   nuclear DNA sequences in estimating species relationships in the genus
   Polygonia. Nodes at which there was no conflict tended to have diverged
   at the same time when analyzed separately, while nodes at which conflict
   was present diverged at different times. We find that two species create
   most of the conflict, and attribute the conflict found in Polygonia
   satyrus to ancient hybridization and conflict found in Polygonia oreas
   to recent or ongoing hybridization. In both examples, the nuclear gene
   regions tended to give the phylogenetic relationships of the species
   supported by morphology and biology.
   Conclusion: Studies inferring species-level relationships using
   molecular data should never be based on a single locus. Here we show
   that the phylogenetic hypothesis generated using mitochondrial DNA gives
   a very different interpretation of the evolutionary history of Polygonia
   species compared to that generated from nuclear DNA. We show that
   possible cases of hybridization in Polygonia are not limited to sister
   species, but may be inferred further back in time. Furthermore, we
   provide more evidence that Haldane's effect might not be as strong a
   process in preventing hybridization in butterflies as has been
   previously thought.},

Abstract = {A panbiogeographic analysis of the distributional patterns of 196
   species of eastern Pacific Isopoda led to the recognition of three
   generalized tracks, which correspond to major biotic components. The
   northern cold-temperate track extends from 62 degrees to 35 degrees N,
   in the northern cold-temperate sub-region (Aleutian Islands, Gulf of
   Alaska and coast of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and northern
   California). The 57 endemic species assigned to it belong mainly to
   suborders Flabellifera, Valvifera and Asellota, although species of
   Oniscidea, Epicarida, Anthuridea, and Gnathiidea are also present. The
   northern warm-temperate/tropical track extends from 33 degrees N to 1
   degrees S, covering the Warm-Temperate and Tropical sub-regions, i.e.,
   southern California to about halfway south into Ecuador. The 27 endemic
   species assigned to it belong mainly to the Flabellifera, most of them
   Cirolanidae and Cymothoidae, and Sphaeromatidae, Valvifera, Anthuridea,
   Asellota, Epicaridea, Oniscidea, and Gnathiidea are also present. The

Abstract = {Documenting financial resources in biodiversity conservation is a key
   aspect worldwide in order to set priorities and use effectively the
   limited resources available. In Mexico, a megadiverse country, studies
   on financial resources invested in biodiversity conservation are scarce
   and do not address funding for conservation comprehensively. Using
   recent data from several sources and applying criteria based on the
   national priorities for conservation, we compiled, systematized and
   analyzed data at a national scale on financing sources, financial
   resources and conservation organizations and their projects. The
   information obtained is presented in various ways and part of it (case
   study) is already an information system that can be continuously
   up-dated. Some of the results show the following: a steady
   diversification of mechanisms and methods for raising funds for
   conservation; an increase in governmental budgets; the acknowledgment by
   the private sector of the importance of biodiversity conservation; a
   greater technical capacity in people and organizations working in
   conservation; a greater accessibility of financial resources to support
   and maintain conservation projects; yet a short term vision in
   conservation projects; among other. Although the results obtained
   through this study are a first approach, they can now be used as a
   baseline to continue gathering and analyzing information on conservation
   financing in Mexico.},

Abstract = {The noxious action of the pesticides dissolved in water and vegetables
   it is manifested from trace concentrations (mu g/1) in human health and
   the environment. For this reason, it is of vital importance to have a
   sensitive and reproducibility method to determine in a rapid and
   reliable manner their concentration in real resources as water, food and
   biological tissues. In this work, a methodology to detect Atrazine and
   Methyl Parathion in trace concentrations in water solutions has been
   developed. The proposed method is based on UV absorption by pesticide
   and the photoacoustic effect generated by transmitted light on a doped
   single crystal (NaCl:Mn2+) attached to a piezoelectric sensor. The
   results show that liquid trace concentrations so low as 0.1 mu g/l can
   be measured.},

Abstract = {Response surface methodology was used for optimization of
   polygalacturonase (PG) and pectinesterase (PE) production in submerged
   fermentation by A. niger. A Central Composite Experimental Design was
   applied, consisting of 22 experiments, including eight central points.
   Variables studied were: fermentation time (24 to 120 h), pH (3.5 to 6.5)
   and initial concentration of pectin (5 to 20 g/l). Maximum PE production
   was 220 U/l, after 74 h of culture, in a medium containing 20 g/l of
   pectin (pH 6.5). The optimal conditions for PG production were pH: 4.1,
   20 g/l of pectin and 94 h of fermentation with a maximum value of 1032
   U/l. Under these conditions, the PE production was low (15 U/l). A
   liquid extract with high PG activity and low PE activity could be
   suitable to be used in food processing in order to reduce the production

Abstract = {The region of Huatusco, in Veracruz, Mexico, is an area of high coffee
   production. Coffee trees are sensitive to temperature and precipitation
   variations. Those climatic elements are related to the altitude, aspect
   and slope it? the agroecological shadow system. A baseline climatic
   scenario was introduced on ombrothermic diagrams to relate the periods
   in which the reproductive phases of the coffee tree develops with the
   climatology of the region. This method was developed in order to achieve
   a better knowledge of the possible impacts of climate change on the
   flowering and fruit development in the species Cofffea arabica and C.
   Canephora. Increases of temperature and changes in precipitation were
   obtained using the outputs of two general circulation models, and
   applied to the basic ombrothermic diagram, in order to measure the
   possible impacts on the stated reproductive phases. According to those
   two climate change scenarios, important differences in regional
   climatology can be projected, and therefore strong impacts were
   detected: changes of the beginning of flowering which is related to the
   mean rainfall, and the extent of the preestival drought during the
   winter months. Also, climatic change could impact the water availability
   during the fruit growing period, which is related the modifications in
   water surplus and to the increase of the intraestival drought during the
   rainy season of the year.},

Abstract = {Cities represent an important threat to biodiversity at different
   scales. Nevertheless, little is known on the processes underlying such
   effects. In this paper we describe bird diversity, structure, and
   composition patterns in different urban land-use categories. For this,
   we surveyed resident bird communities in four representative land-use
   categories of southwestern Mexico City. Our results show that bird
   communities vary greatly along the different studied urban land-uses,
   which represent an urbanization development gradient. Bird communities
   were highly dominated by few generalist species in areas with commercial
   components, while showed to have higher evenness values in green areas.
   Bird species richness decreased and bird abundances increased with
   urbanization intensity. Also, our results indicate that bird species
   richness and abundance values are sensible to site-specific habitat
   characteristics. Although we did not find a clear pattern of taxonomic
   homogenization related to urbanization, our results show that
   urbanization development entails the functional homogenization of bird
   communities. Thus, based on our results, we suggest three urban planning
   and management activities: (1) regulate land-use change related to
   urbanization; (2) increase the number of green areas within the city;
   (3) establish bird monitoring programs to identify focal areas that need
   management and assist with ecological data for urban planning. (C) 2008

Title = {Response of newly hatched Octopus bimaculoides fed enriched
   Artemia salina: Growth performance, ontogeny of the digestive
   enzyme and tissue amino acid content},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},

Abstract = {The performance of Octopus bimaculoides juveniles from coastal areas of
   Baja California (Mexico) and reared in captivity was evaluated using
   Artemia salina as food source in three different treatments: Artemia
   enriched with either AlgaMac or Spirulina maxima and without enrichment.
   After 20 days, significant differences were found among treatments in
   terms of growth, which was significantly higher for juvenile fed
   AlgaMac-enriched Artemia, followed by those fed unenriched Artemia.
   Moreover, far higher growth rates (0.74-0.88 mg day(-1)) were obtained
   than those reported for other octopus species of the same size.
   Digestive enzyme activity during the experimental period (20 days)
   showed an oscillatory behavior, with a tendency to stabilize after day
   15. Trypsin was the most important protease, though lipases and amylases
   were also present. The whole-body lipid content of the juvenile was
   apparently influenced by the lipid content in the food. The amino acid
   profile remained unaffected after juvenile were fed the different
   treatments; however, differences were found between the initial and
   final whole-body content of the juvenile, with relatively lower amounts
   of isoleucine, leucine and tyrosine, and relatively higher amounts of
   threonine, alanine and glycine after 20 days of feeding. The Artemia
   amino acid content of phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and valine was
   limited, and growth would likely be further promoted with a more
   suitable diet. Thus, O. bimaculoides is a promising species for
   commercial culture, and even though good results were obtained when fed
   Artemia, a more appropriate food source should be sought to obtain an
   amino acid profile that will maximize growth. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Fish meal (FM) has long been considered an essential ingredient for the
   formulation of shrimp feeds. Until recently, 12\%FM was considered a
   minimum amount, below which weight gain would become reduced due to a
   reduction in feed intake. In order to test this perceived minimum value,
   an experiment was conducted on a long-term basis with 4 replicates. Four
   practical isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated for
   Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles. Survival, weight gain, feed conversion
   ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio were determined for 0, 6, 10
   and 15\% FM diets and a reference diet. Shrimp survival ranged from 84
   to 86.5\%. Shrimp fed a diet with 0\% FM showed lower average weight and
   SGR compared to the other treatments (P<0.05). FCR of shrimp fed the
   reference diet was significantly lower compared to the other treatments.
   Shortterm energy budget did not differ in recovered energy (RE).
   Variations in RE according to FM level were expected, however, it
   remained low (0.12 kJ prawn(-1) day(-1)) and it was not possible to
   discriminate among dietary treatments. Data indicate that RE was similar
   as evidenced by an absence of difference in weight gain among 6. 10 and
   15\% FM diets and the reference diet (0.98 g/wk). Growth results
   obtained over a long-term period and in clear water indicated the
   possibility for FM replacement with soybean plus canola meals. (C) 2009

Title = {Uniqueness of the Fock quantization of a free scalar field on
   S1 with time dependent mass},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {79},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We analyze the quantum description of a free scalar field on the circle
   in the presence of an explicitly time-dependent potential, also
   interpretable as a time-dependent mass. Classically, the field satisfies
   a linear wave equation of the form xi-xi('')+f(t)xi=0. We prove that the
   representation of the canonical commutation relations corresponding to
   the particular case of a massless free field (f=0) provides a unitary
   implementation of the dynamics for sufficiently general mass terms,
   f(t). Furthermore, this representation is uniquely specified, among the
   class of representations determined by S-1-invariant complex structures,
   as the only one allowing a unitary dynamics. These conclusions can be
   extended in fact to fields on the two-sphere possessing axial symmetry.
   This generalizes a uniqueness result previously obtained in the context
   of the quantum field description of the Gowdy cosmologies, in the case
   of linear polarization and for any of the possible topologies of the
   spatial sections.},

Title = {Metal distribution in coral reef complex Cayo Arcas in the Gulf of

Abstract = {This study evaluated the spatial and temporal distribution of metals in
   the coral reef system Cayos Arcas and Triangulos in the Campeche Bank
   region, off the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. No information has been
   generated before for the incorporation of natural and non-natural
   occurring metals, some of which are possibly endowed by the oil marine
   station Cayo Arcas. The multivariate exploratory study of the metals on
   the coral skeletons, showed the formation of two distinct groups. The
   metals that have the highest influence on the differentiation of the
   groups are the metals that are natural constituents of the coral
   skeletons, in particular Sr can explain much of the differences between
   the groups, and to a much lesser extent are the metals that could be
   indicators of pollution. This differentiation suggests that, in our
   case, the environment around the corals has a higher impact than the
   non-naturally occurring metals (and possible indicators of pollution).
   The two groups formed corresponded to: the coral cores influenced by
   open sea variables and the coral cores in the inner part of the keys
   which is less exposed to open sea variables. A chronological study was
   made to two samples that had the longest coral section and were situated
   in two clearly distinctive zones: an exposed surface subjected to high
   wave forces and another that was less exposed. Ni and Zn show an
   accumulation trend in both coral samples, while Ba showed an increase in
   incorporation around 1980 when the Cayo Arcas oil marine station was
   constructed.},

Abstract = {Los Riscos Cave belongs to the El Abra limestone and its geographical
   location is in the Sierra Gorda in the State of Queretaro, Mexico. The
   cave has a high faunal diversity that includes arthropods and some
   vertebrates, such as vampire bats and anurans, and includes the robber
   frog Eleutherodactylus longipes (Baird, 1859). The abundance of the
   robber frog changes non-randomly between dry and rainy seasons and is
   related to the search for humid conditions inside the cave. In addition,
   the robber frog was located in areas where some scattered light may
   influence its dispersion inside the cave; and therefore, its activity.
   Frogs displayed spontaneous circadian rhythms of locomotor activity from
   the first days of the experimental observation in constant darkness. The
   average period of circadian rhythms was 24.85 +/- 0.93 h indicating, in
   isolated conditions, a diurnal activity. When exposed to artificial
   light-dark cycles, the animals lacked daily activity rhythms, and
   ultradian activity was observed. The preference for high humidity and
   low illumination in the cave and a partial endogenous circadian
   rhythmicity confirm the troglophilic affinity of the robber frog to cave
   environments.},

Abstract = {Meiosis is a key cellular and molecular process for sexual reproduction
   contributing to the genetic variability of organisms. This process takes
   place after DNA replication and consists in a double cellular division,
   giving rise to four haploid daughter cells or gametes. Meiotic
   recombination between homologous chromosomes, in the meiotic prophase I,
   is mediated by a tripartite structure named Synaptonemal Complex (SC).
   The SC is a peptidic scaffold in which the chromatin of homologous
   chromosomes is organized during the pachytene stage, holding chromosomes
   together until the meiotic recombination and genetic exchange have taken
   place. The role of chromatin structure in formation of the SC and the
   meiotic recombination at meiotic prophase I remain largely unknown. In
   this review we address the epigenome contribution to the SC formation at
   meiotic prophase I, with particular attention on the chromatin structure
   modifications occurring during the sub-stages of meiotic prophase I.},

Abstract = {Taenia solium infections continue being a health problem in undeveloped
   countries, and few effective control measures against this. parasite are
   being applied. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPS) belong to the innate immune
   response and capable of destroying pathogens. We tested the ability of
   two AMPS, Temporin A (TA) and Iseganan IB-367 (IB-367) to damage T.
   crassiceps cysticerci in vitro. Doses of 200 and 400 mu g/ml of TA and
   IB-367 caused cysticerci to shrink, lose motility, the formation of
   macrovesicles in the tegument, as well as decreased evagination
   properties. These changes were observed as early as 3-6 h and became
   more pronounced over 24 h, when the morphological changes of the
   bladders became evident by both light and electron microscopy. Electron
   micrographs of cysticerci exposed to peptides showed initial changes as
   collapsed microvesicles in the tegument, with formation of large
   vesicles and extrusion of tegumentary tissues into the surrounding
   media, which led to complete loss of the tegument as well as shrinkage
   and complete loss of structure of parenchymal tissue after 24 h.
   Peptides administered to cysticercotic mice one month post-infection in
   a single intraperitoneal dose of 200 or 400 mu g, reduced the parasite
   load by 25\% for IB-367, and 50\% for TA. The humoral response of
   infected mice does not appear capable of killing surviving cysticerci.
   Our studies show that in vitro, AMPS severely damage the tegument and
   the scolex, and open a new pathway for biological drug design or the
   development of transgenic animals that over express these peptides
   capable of killing the cysticerci in vivo. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Disturbance-Response Analysis: a Method for Rapid Assessment of the
   Threat to Species in Disturbed Areas},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {377-387},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We developed a method with which to analyze a specie's response to
   chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD). We regressed density of
   individuals on the intensity of 3 disturbance agents (human activities,
   raising livestock, and land degradation) along CAD gradients to
   determine how much CAD is experienced by a species; whether species are
   ruderal (achieving maximum densities in disturbed sites); whether
   density declines as a result of CAD; which disturbance agents are
   responsible for this reduction; and the number of populations that
   decline as a result of CAD. We tested the method on 9 threatened
   Mammillaria species (Cactaceae). Seven species were ruderal. In 4
   species, actual disturbance surpassed the CAD intensity in which plants
   achieved their maximum densities; thus, the density of those 4 species
   appeared to be declining. For 7 species, some populations were
   threatened by human activities or livestock, whereas others were favored
   by them. Land degradation negatively affected all species. Our results
   allowed us to distinguish 4 groups of species that had similar responses
   and thus may require different forms of management. Our method provided
   an estimation of the growth rate (.) of the studied populations that was
   significantly correlated with lambda s obtained from demographic
   studies. The size structures of populations were consistent with the
   predictions of the analysis, which suggests our results are consistent
   and reliable. Disturbance-response analysis provides a basis for
   management in heavily populated areas, where conservation must be
   achieved along with development activities that cause CAD. The method
   provides readily interpretable information, which facilitates
   participative decision making; the data are rapidly generated, which
   makes it appropriate when results are required promptly or for
   assessment of large numbers of species; and it provides a comprehensive
   perception of how threatened species behave in the real world.},

Abstract = {We studied in Opuntia tomentosa the effect of plant shade (orientation
   and distance), and the place where the seeds remained before
   germination. Seeds were collected in 1998 and a) sown immediately on
   soil (non-buried seeds), b) stored in the laboratory and sown on soil
   during the 1999 rainy season (control) or c) buried after collection
   (under the shade of a tree, a rock and in an open space), exhumed 7
   months later and sown in 1999 (exhumed seeds). Seeds were sown under or
   outside the shade of several trees: or on the northern, eastern and
   western sides of a 14-m-tall tree. In 1999, germination was high in all
   samples, but the control seeds had delayed germination. After two rainy
   seasons, non-buried seeds had the lowest germination rate. Germination
   was not affected by the distance from the tree. Outside of the plant's
   shade, germination was low. Germination was affected more by the
   environmental heterogeneity than by the individual plant shade.
   Germination probabilities were the highest at 16-19 degrees C; field
   germination was zero at 20.6 degrees C. Seed polymorphism and
   microenvirommental heterogeneity spread germination across two rainy
   seasons creating a permanent seed bank. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Opuntia tomentosa seeds have physiological dormancy and a permeable but
   hard funicular envelope that restricts water Uptake and embryo growth.
   Dormancy break, germination, and changes in the funiculus were compared
   in laboratory-stored seeds and in those buried for 7 months at different
   microsites and later exhumed and stored in the laboratory. The funicular
   envelopes of both lots were examined with a scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). Seeds in both lots were: scarified with H2SO4 (0, 45, 60 and 90
   min), treated with gibberellins (0, 1000 and 2000 ppm) and germinated at
   the same ages (0, 2, 4, 7, and 10 months after exhumation) at 24 degrees
   C. Light effect was determined at 24 degrees C and 20-35 degrees C. In
   laboratory-stored seeds germination was low. Exhumed seeds germinated in
   similar to 50\%, the remaining ones required scarification and
   gibberellins, but lost dormancy two months later. Gibberellins reduced
   germination heterogeneity, and scarification reduced germination; the
   adverse effect of scarification was offset by gibberellins. Exhumed
   seeds germinated mainly in darkness at 20-35 C and partially in far red
   light at both temperatures. SEM showed that fungi eroded the funiculus
   reducing its resistance, O. tomentosa could form a seed bank, ensuring
   its survival under heterogeneous environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Upper mixed layer temperature and salinity variability in the tropical

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal interannual variability of mixed layer (ML)
   temperature and ML salinity off Baja California are examined using
   empirical orthogonal functions analysis. Conductivity-temperature-depth
   data collected from October 1997 through January 2007 over a grid based
   on Mexican Research of the California Current quarterly survey cruises
   are analyzed. Net heat flux (NHF) and sea surface height anomaly (SSH)
   from satellite products are also analyzed. The first leading mode of
   both ML temperature and ML salinity show a single-signed loading
   pattern, in which the variability increases southward. Those patterns
   have been reported before, but they are lacking a quantitative
   explanation. ML temperature variability is mainly associated with NHF
   variability, while ML salinity variability is mainly associated with
   large-scale SSH variability. The principal component (PC) of ML salinity
   is correlated with North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and Warm Water Volume
   climate indices, while the PC of ML temperature is only correlated with
   the latter index. Those results indicate that the principal mode of ML
   salinity variability is a diagnostic variable of basin-scale process. An
   abrupt freshening (similar to-0.7) and cooling (similar to-4 degrees C)
   event from January 1998 to January 1999 and an abrupt freshening
   (similar to-0.5) event from January 2002 to January 2003 are conspicuous
   features in the mixed layer. The 1998-1999 events are associated with
   the major El Nino-La Nina cycle in the 10-year period. The 2002-2003
   freshening is related to an enhancement of subarctic water into the
   equatorward flow that started during the summer of 2002 off Oregon (49
   degrees N).},

Title = {Universality of Rank-Ordering Distributions in the Arts and Sciences},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Searching for generic behaviors has been one of the driving forces
   leading to a deep understanding and classification of diverse phenomena.
   Usually a starting point is the development of a phenomenology based on
   observations. Such is the case for power law distributions encountered
   in a wealth of situations coming from physics, geophysics, biology,
   lexicography as well as social and financial networks. This finding is
   however restricted to a range of values outside of which finite size
   corrections are often invoked. Here we uncover a universal behavior of
   the way in which elements of a system are distributed according to their
   rank with respect to a given property, valid for the full range of
   values, regardless of whether or not a power law has previously been
   suggested. We propose a two parameter functional form for these
   rank-ordered distributions that gives excellent fits to an impressive
   amount of very diverse phenomena, coming from the arts, social and
   natural sciences. It is a discrete version of a generalized beta
   distribution, given by f(r) = A(N+1-r)(b)/r(a), where r is the rank, N
   its maximum value, A the normalization constant and (a, b) two fitting
   exponents. Prompted by our genetic sequence observations we present a
   growth probabilistic model incorporating mutation-duplication features
   that generates data complying with this distribution. The competition
   between permanence and change appears to be a relevant, though not
   necessary feature. Additionally, our observations mainly of social
   phenomena suggest that a multifactorial quality resulting from the
   convergence of several heterogeneous underlying processes is an
   important feature. We also explore the significance of the distribution
   parameters and their classifying potential. The ubiquity of our findings
   suggests that there must be a fundamental underlying explanation, most
   probably of a statistical nature, such as an appropriate central limit
   theorem formulation.},

Abstract = {While birdsong is a model system for animal communication studies, our
   knowledge is derived primarily from the study of only one sex and is
   therefore incomplete. The study of song in a role-reversed species would
   provide a unique opportunity to study selective pressures and mechanisms
   specific to females, and to test the robustness of current theories in
   an empirically novel manner. We investigated function of female song in
   stripe-headed sparrows (Aimophila r. ruficauda), a Neotropical, duetting
   passerine, and found that during simulated territorial intrusions by a
   female, male or duetting pair, females: (i) sang more than males to
   same-sex and duet playback, (ii) played a leading singing role in all
   contexts, and (iii) showed a longer term song response than males. These
   results suggest that females sing competitively against other females,
   and that intrasexual selection may be greater among females than among
   males. This is the first songbird study to show a stronger vocal role in
   territory defence for females than males. Stripe-headed sparrows are
   group-living cooperative breeders, and preliminary data suggest that
   polyandry and/or resource defence may explain strong female singing
   behaviour. Stripe-headed sparrows may be a useful study species for
   expanding our knowledge of vocal communication in female animals.},

Title = {A comparison of traditional elasticity and variance-standardized
   perturbation analyses: a case study with the tropical tree species
   Manilkara zapota (Sapotaceae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the population dynamics of tropical trees has expanded
   considerably in the past 20 years. An important observation deriving
   from these investigations is the confirmation that population behaviour
   varies both in time and space. A tool recently developed to evaluate the
   potential for variation in vital rates, and therefore in Population
   growth rate, is variance-standardized perturbation analysis (VSPA). In
   this paper we report the results of a 2-y demographic analysis of a
   population of the tropical tree Manilkara zapota in a subtropical rain
   forest in the Mexican state of Veracruz, in which variance-standardized
   perturbation analysis was applied and compared with the results of the
   traditional elasticity analyses. To build population projection
   matrices. we tagged and followed a sample of 91 juvenile and adult
   individuals, and 635 seedlings. We subdivided the sample in nine size
   classes (defined by tree height and dbh; as well as leaf size, in the
   case of seedlings) and estimated transition probabilities and fecundity
   for each class. The demography of M. zapota varied greatly from the
   first to the second year of study (in 1998-1999. lambda = 0.987, while
   in 1999-2000, lambda = 1.038) due to negligible seed production during
   the first year and a massive reproductive event during the second. The
   largest elasticity values for both years corresponded to persistence of
   large juveniles and adults. Although the fecundity entries showed very
   low elasticity values, the variance-standardized perturbation analysis
   revealed the importance of these matrix entries; transition to larger
   categories and retrogression to smaller ones of saplings and juveniles
   were also important demographic processes contributing to variation
   lambda according to the VSPA. Thus, although the results of elasticity
   analysis and VSPA were similar for the 1998-1999 matrix, they differed
   substantially for the 1999-2000 matrix. In the latter, the VSPA enhanced
   the importance of demographic processes that are intuitively relevant
   for the population studied. This points toward the necessity of further
   exploring the use of VSPA. since it offers several advantages over the
   traditional elasticity analysis: it, concentrates on the impact on
   lambda of vital rates that actually vary, and the interpretation of the
   results is more realistic and straight forward.},

Abstract = {Studies of tropical secondary forest succession face strong limitations
   due to the slow pace of succession and the time-consuming task of
   monitoring processes. The occurrence of tree rings in secondary forest
   trees may help expand our knowledge on succession in these systems and
   may be useful for fallow dating in chronosequence studies. We examine
   here the potential of tree rings to study forest succession by sampling
   70 species along chronosequences of dry and wet forests in southern
   Mexico. Based on wood anatomical features, we estimated that about 37
   percent of the species presented distinct growth rings useful for ring
   studies. Overall, maximum number of rings matched well the
   interview-based fallow ages but, at some sites, trees had consistently
   higher numbers of rings, probably due to errors in fallow ages derived
   from interviews. Best fallow age estimations were obtained by examining
   rings in both pioneer and nonpioneer species. Reconstruction of species'
   establishment dates revealed that pioneer and nonpioneer species
   establish early during succession, and that species of both groups
   continue to recruit after many years. Our study clearly shows that tree
   ring analysis is a promising tool for studies on secondary forest
   succession in the tropics.},

Abstract = {Although initially it was thought that testosterone inhibited the
   display of paternal behavior in males or rodents, it has been shown that
   in some species high testosterone levels are needed are exhibition of
   paternal care. In captivity, males of Volcano Mouse (Neotomodon alstoni)
   provide pups the same care provided by the mother, with the exception of
   suckling. Here we measured plasmatic testosterone concentrations 10 days
   after mating, five and 20 days postpartum, and 10 days after males were
   isolated from their families in order to determine possible changes in
   this hormone, associated to the presence and age of pups. Males of
   Volcano Mouse exhibited paternal behavior when their testosterone levels
   were relatively high. Although levels of this hormone did not change
   with the presence or pups age. males that invested more little in
   huddling showed higher testosterone levels. It is possible that in the
   Volcano Mouse testosterone modulates paternal behavior indirectly, as in
   the California mouse. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (1-2): 433-439. Epub 2009 June

Abstract = {We introduce the so-called homological systems in a module category over
   a pre-ordered set, which generalize the notion of a stratifying system
   over a linearly ordered set, and study both the corresponding modules
   filtrated by the systems and algebras stratified by the systems. In
   particular, we recover the tilting theory for pre-standardly stratified
   algebras, and get a general formula for computing the Cartan
   determinants of pre-standardly stratified algebras in terms of standard
   modules and simple modules. Also, the finitistic dimension of a given
   algebra, and the relative homological dimensions of full subcategories
   of the modules related to a homological system, are discussed. As an
   application, we get a new bound for the finitistic dimension of a
   pre-standardly stratified algebra.},

Abstract = {Lithium, a drug commonly used to treat mood disorders, and the
   psychostimulant methamphetamine are both capable of altering circadian
   rhythmicity. Although the actions of lithium on the circadian system are
   thought to occur through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta
   (GSK3 beta), the mechanism by which methamphetamine alters circadian
   rhythms is unknown. We tested the effects of concurrent methamphetamine
   and lithium treatment on the circadian wheel-running behavior of mice.
   Methamphetamine alone lengthened both the active duration and the
   free-running period of locomotor activity in animals housed in constant
   conditions. Administering lithium enhanced the period-lengthening
   effects of methamphetamine in animals housed in constant darkness. This
   effect was even more pronounced when animals were housed in constant
   light. Lithium increased both methamphetamine intake and serum levels of
   methamphetamine, possibly contributing to the effects on circadian
   behavior. We also tested the effect of methamphetamine in mutant mice
   possessing only one allele for Gsk3 beta. These animals, when treated
   with methamphetamine, responded like wild-type mice treated with a
   combination of methamphetamine and lithium, displaying long,
   free-running rhythms. These data, together with many others in the
   literature, point to a complicated interaction between the circadian
   system and the development and possible treatment of psychopathologies
   such as bipolar disorder and drug addiction. Behavioural Pharmacology

Title = {SPERM VIABILITY IN THE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT OF FEMALES IN A POPULATION OF

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Asynchronous reproduction is a common phenomenon in high-elevation
   populations of lizards from Central Mexico. Sperm storage in the
   reproductive tract of females is the mechanism for making oocyte
   fertilization possible. Our study addresses questions related to
   functional oviductal sperm storage of females mating on different dates
   throughout the reproductive season. A Population of Sceloporus
   mucronatus with copulation in the summer and ovulation in the fall was
   chosen for this experiment. Eleven females that copulated in the field
   during June and 13 females that copulated in Captivity during August
   were maintained in the laboratory until parturition. The number of
   pregnant females and the litter sizes produced in each experimental
   group were indicative of the viability of the stored sperm. Sperm stored
   in the reproductive tract of females were able to fertilize eggs after 4
   months. No significant differences were found in the number of pregnant
   females between the 2 experimental groups nor in the litter sizes that
   they produced. We found that the amount of time sperm were held in the
   female reproductive tract (ca. 3 months) had no effect on the capacity
   of sperm to fertilize eggs. Histological examination of 8 oviducts
   collected before the mating season eliminated the possibility of sperm
   storage from one year to the next. In this system, sperm retention could
   have evolved as a response mechanism to deal with the asynchrony between
   sexes in die reproductive cycles. However, we cannot rule out
   alternative hypotheses.},

Abstract = {The people in Mexico still depend upon the use of medicinal plants to
   treat simple health problems, including those who live in regions like
   Tlanchinol Hidalgo, where it is still possible to find people who speak
   the pre-Hispanic Nahua language. This area is surrounded by rain forest,
   which is more or less well conserved, so ethnopharmacological field
   studies are quite relevant. The cultural knowledge about the use of
   medicinal plants converge with the richness in the surrounding flora
   making this region ideal for the selection of traditionally used
   medicinal plants.
   Aim of the study: To present the results of an ethnopharmacological
   field survey conducted in the municipality of Tlanchinol Hidalgo, Mexico
   analyzed with two different quantitative tools, with the aim of
   selecting the most important species used in traditional medicine.
   Materials and methods: Direct interviews with the people were performed
   in several short visits to the municipality of Tlanchinol Hidalgo. The
   plants were collected, and the species were determined. The interviews
   were analyzed with two quantitative tools. First, the factor informant
   consensus highlighted the agreement in the use of plants and the
   fidelity level defined as: the ratio between the number of informants
   who independently suggested the use of a species for the same major
   purpose and the total number of informants who mentioned the plant for
   any use. Furthermore, we analyzed the use-mentions for the plants.
   Results: The results of the factor informant consensus showed that the
   gastrointestinal category had the greatest agreement, followed by the
   respiratory and dermatological categories. The most important species
   according to their fidelity are: Coleus blumei, Plantago australis and
   Lippia dulcis for the gastrointestinal category: Borago officinalis,
   Foeniculum vulgare, and Eucalyptus globulus for the respiratory
   category; and Ageratum houstonianum and Solanum nigrescens for the
   dermatological category.
   Conclusion: As a result of the present study, we recommend the plants
   listed in Table 2 for further ethnopharmacological studies, especially
   Lippia dulcis var Mexicana. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Fractal development during polymerization of a dimethacrylate system

   obtained sequentially by pulsed photoacoustics. The photoacoustic
   signals as obtained in situ during photopolymerization of Bis-CMA/TEDGMA
   were analyzed by rescaled range analysis, dispersion analysis, and
   detrended fluctuation analysis methods. The analysis reveals the
   presence of more than one scaling parameter and, therefore, belongs to a
   complex process known as multifractal. The evolution of fractality
   during photopolymerization was compared under equivalent conditions with
   the chemical conversion (of dimethacrylate double bonds) as a function
   of time, as monitor by infrared spectroscopy. This kinetic Study was
   also used to correlate the fractal nature of the dimethacrylate reaction
   system with the condensed-state transitions emerging during the
   photochemical reaction. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym

Abstract = {Gonad development during the early life of Octopus maya is described in
   terms of histological, morphometric, oocytes growth. and somatic-oocyte
   relationship data obtained from Octopus Cultured at the UMDI-UNAM., in
   Sisal, Yucatan, Mexico. This Study is the first publication oil gonad
   development during the early life of Octopus maya. A total of 83 O. maya
   specimens were used; then, sizes ranged from 6.5 to 76 mm of total
   length (TL), 4 to 28 mill of dorsal mantle length (DML), 2.5 to 20 mm of
   ventral mantle length (VML), and 0.0180 to 7.2940 g of fixed body weight
   (fBW). Animals were weighed and measured only after preservation. A loss
   of 10\% of living weight was estimated for juvenile octopuses after
   formalin preservation. The relation of length to weight (VML, DML,
   TL/fBW) pooled for both sexes had a strong positive correlation (r), as
   shown by a potential power function that was quite close to 1. Compound
   images were produced from numerous microscopic fields. The histological
   examination revealed that, 4 months after hatching, male Octopus (24.5
   mill DML and 7.2940 fBW) were in gonad stages 2 (maturing) to 3
   (mature), with spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the tubule wall and
   abundant spermatids and spermatozoa ill the central lumen of the
   seminiferous tubules, suggesting the occurrence of different phases of:
   gonad development Lit different maturity stages. In contrast, females
   (22.5 mm DML and 4.8210 g fBW) at the same time since hatching were
   immature (stage 1), with many oogonia, few oocytes, and germinal
   epithelium. This suggests that males reach maturity earlier than
   females. indicating a probable onset of maturity for males at around 4
   months of culture or 8 g of wet body weight. Our results indicate the
   possibility that the size-at-weight can be recognized early with a
   degree of certainty that allows the sexes to be separated for Culture
   purposes: but more detailed studies oil reproduction in relation to
   endocrinology and nutrition are needed.},

Abstract = {Environmental pollutants, chemicals, and drugs have an impact on
   children's immune system development. Mexico City (MC) children exposed
   to significant concentrations of air pollutants exhibit chronic
   respiratory inflammation, systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and
   cognitive deficits. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to severe air
   pollution plays a role in the immune responses of asymptomatic,
   apparently healthy children. Blood measurements for markers of immune
   function, inflammatory mediators, and molecules interacting with the
   lipopolysaccharide recognition complex were obtained from two cohorts of
   matched children (aged 9.7 +/- 1.2 years) from southwest Mexico City
   (SWMC) (n = 66) and from a control city (n = 93) with criteria pollutant
   levels below current standards. MC children exhibited significant
   decreases in the numbers of natural killer cells (p = .003) and
   increased numbers of mCD14+ monocytes (p<.001) and CD8+ cells (p = .02).
   Lower concentrations of interferon gamma (p = .009) and
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (p<.001), an endotoxin
   tolerance-like state, systemic inflammation, and an anti-inflammatory
   response were also present in the highly exposed children. C-reactive
   protein and the prostaglandin E metabolite levels were positively
   correlated with twenty-four- and forty-eight-hour cumulative
   concentrations of PM2.5. Exposure to urban air pollution is associated
   with immunodysregulation and systemic inflammation in children and is a
   major health threat.},

Abstract = {Hexokinase-catalyzed glucose phosphorylation is the first and crucial
   step for glucose utilization. Although there are reported studies on
   glucose metabolism in commercial species, knowledge on it is almost nil
   in zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important model organism for biological
   research. We have searched these fish hexokinase genes by BLAST
   analysis; determined their expression in liver, muscle, brain and heart:
   measured their response to fasting and glucose administration; and
   performed homology sequences studies to glimpse their evolutionary
   history. We have confirmed by RT-qPCR studies that the six DNA sequences
   annotated as possible hexokinases in the NCBI GenBank are transcribed.
   The organ distribution of the HXK genes is similar in zebrafish as in
   mammals, to which they are distantly related. Of these, DrGLK and
   DrSHXK1 are expressed in the fish liver, DrHXK1 in brain and heart, and
   DrHXK2 in muscle. The only gene responsive to glucose was liver DrGLK.
   Its expression is induced approximately 1 h after glucose
   intraperitoneal injection, but not after saline solution injection. The
   comparison of the fish sequences and the corresponding mammalian ones
   imply that in both taxa the main muscle and brain isoforms are fusion
   products of the ancestral gene, their amino halves having separated
   before than their carboxy ones, followed by the fusion event, whereas
   fish and mammalian glucokinase genes remained unduplicated. (c) 2008

Abstract = {Seventeen different media known to support the growth and isolation of
   members of the class Actinobacteria were evaluated as selective
   isolation media for the recovery of this microbial group from marine
   sediments samples collected in the Gulf of California and the Gulf of
   Mexico. A general selective isolation procedure was employed for six
   sediments and nearly 300 actinomycetes were recovered from the selective
   isolation plates. Full 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the
   isolates belonged to several actinobacterial taxa, notably to the genera
   Actinomadura, Dietzia, Gordonia, Micromonospora, Nonomuraea,
   Rhodococcus, Saccharomonospora, Saccharopolyspora, Salinispora,
   Streptomyces, ``Solwaraspora{''} and Verrucosispora. Previous works on
   marine sediments have been restricted to the isolation of members of the
   genera Micromonospora, Rhodococcus and Streptomyces. This study provides
   further evidence that Actinobacteria present in marine habitats are not
   restricted to the Micromonospora-Rhodococcus-Streptomyces grouping.
   Indeed, this first systematic study shows the extent of actinobacterial
   diversity that can be found in marine sediments collected in Mexico and
   probably, worldwide.},

Abstract = {In this work we explored the competition between spin-orbit and
   Jahn-Teller effects as decisive influences in the ground states of the
   T-d Au-20 (+/-gamma) (gamma=1,2,3). All our electronic calculations were
   based in the relativistic density functional theory in the zeroth-order
   regular approximation (ZORA) to the Dirac equation. Calculations were
   done in both versions of ZORA: scalar relativistic and full-relativistic
   including the spin-orbit interaction. We concluded that for the Au-20
   (-3) ion is necessary to use a full-relativistic theory in order to
   predict a symmetry-lowering from tetrahedral. We predict a trigonal C-3v
   isomeric form for this trianion due to a Jahn-Teller distortion of its
   parent T-d. For the rest of ions we found a tendency to conserve their
   pristine tetrahedral configurations. In these cases we found one of both
   possibilities: a quenching of the vibronic interaction by spin-orbit
   coupling or simply a weak Jahn-Teller effect which is not enough to
   distort appreciably the cluster.},

Abstract = {Serotiny, or delayed seed dispersal, is common in fluctuating
   environments because it hedges the risks of establishment. Mammillaria
   pectinifera (Cactaceae) facultatively expels fruits in the year they are
   produced or retains them to disperse the seed over several years. We
   tested whether M. pectinifera increased fruit expulsion as a response to
   increased rainfall. While no fruit expulsion was observed in 1997. a dry
   year, in the wetter 1998 around 20\% of all fruits formed were expelled
   from the maternal plant. A greenhouse experiment showed thin high
   moisture results in the plants expelling all their fruits. Because in
   1998 establishment was five times higher than in 1997 this response
   seems to be highly adaptive: Active fruit expulsion and consequent seed
   release increases the probability of establishment during pulses of high
   precipitation.},

   An improved differential viscosity model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {130},
Number = {4},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {We propose a simple and general model accounting for the dependence of
   the viscosity of a hard sphere suspension at arbitrary volume fractions.
   The model constitutes a continuum-medium description based on a
   recursive-differential method where correlations between the spheres are
   introduced through an effective volume fraction. In contrast to other
   differential methods, the introduction of the effective volume fraction
   as the integration variable implicitly considers interactions between
   the spheres of the same recursive stage. The final expression for the
   viscosity scales with this effective volume fraction, which allows
   constructing a master curve that contains all the experimental
   situations considered. The agreement of our expression for the viscosity
   with experiments at low- and high-shear rates and in the high-frequency
   limit is remarkable for all volume fractions.},

Abstract = {Classical motion in an inverse square potential is shown to be
   equivalent to free motion on a hyperbola. The existence of a classical
   splitting between the q > 0 and q < 0 regions of motion is demonstrated.
   We show that this last property may be regarded as the classical
   counterpart of the superselection rule occurring in the corresponding
   quantum problem. We solve the quantum problem in momentum space finding
   that there is no way of quantizing its energy but that the
   eigenfunctions suffice to describe the single renormalized bound state
   of the system. The dynamical symmetry of the classical problem is found
   to be O(1, 1). Both this symmetry and the symmetry of inversion through
   the origin are found to be broken. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The effect of shell preference in the wild and field shell experience on
   choice in laboratory shell-choice experiments by hermit crabs was
   investigated. The hermit crab Calcinus californiensis prefers one of two
   different shell species in the wild site where we studied its behavior.
   The two most occupied gastropod shells were Nerita scabricosta (76\%)
   and Thais biserialis (12\%), with the remaining animals occupying a
   range of other shell species. Hermit crabs, originally collected in
   Thais and Nerita shells, showed a higher preference for Thais than for
   Nerita shells. However, shell preference was influenced by previous
   housing experience in the wild. In addition, the shell adequacy index
   showed that in the wild females occupy Thais shells relatively larger
   than the preferred size used under controlled conditions.},

   analogous theorems of finite determination for such group. This work is

Title = {History meets ecology: a geographical analysis of ecological restriction
   in the Neotropical humid montane forests avifaunas},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To analyse the ecological patterns of distribution of the avifaunas of
   the Neotropical humid montane forests, by assessing the degree of
   habitat restriction among species through the calculation of a numerical
   index, analysing their relationships with adjacent habitat, and
   exploring the relative contribution of both higher and lower habitats in
   shaping the avian assemblages.
   The Neotropical humid montane forests, from Mexico to north-western
   Argentina.
   The degree of species' restriction to the habitat was calculated through
   a restriction index based on published endemicity indexes. The index
   scores range from 0 to 1: a score of 1 indicates a totally endemic
   species (i.e. fully restricted to the habitat); values tending to 0
   indicate a widespread species.
   In Mesoamerica, completely restricted species represent a lower
   proportion of the total avifauna than in South American humid montane
   forests; whereas species shared to other habitats showed a higher
   proportion of the avifauna with affinities to higher altitude forests
   (e.g. pine and pine-oak forests). South America, on the other hand,
   holds assemblages with a high proportion of completely restricted
   species; species shared to other habitats showed a high proportion of
   taxa with affinities to lowland forests.
   The ecological distribution of the HMF's avifauna could be partitioned
   in three main components: the ecologically restricted avifauna, the high
   altitude species and, the lower altitude species, which are tightly
   associated to the floristic composition along the gradient. The history
   of formation of the HMF flora and the ecological distribution of
   different avian taxa suggest a common history. Finally, the restriction
   index allowed a detailed evaluation of the composition of avian
   assemblages, their degree of restriction to the habitat and of the
   affinities regarding adjacent habitats, as well as an accurate
   distinction between species richness and restricted species richness,
   which should be a fundamental step towards the establishment of
   conservation priorities.},

Title = {Proper actions of locally compact groups on equivariant absolute
   extensors},
Journal = {FUNDAMENTA MATHEMATICAE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {205},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-145},
Abstract = {Let G be a locally compact Hausdorff group. We study equivariant
   absolute (neighborhood) extensors (G-AE's and G-ANE's) in the category
   G-M of all proper G-spaces that are metrizable by a G-invariant metric.
   We first solve the linearization problem for proper group actions by
   proving that each X is an element of G-M admits an equivariant embedding
   in a Banach G-space L such that L\textbackslash{}\{0\} is a proper
   G-space and L\textbackslash{}\{0\} is an element of G-AE. This implies
   that in G-M the notions of G-A(N)E and G-A(N)R coincide. Our embedding
   result is applied to prove that if a G-space X is a G-ANE (resp., a
   G-AE) such that all the orbits in X are metrizable, then the orbit space
   X/G is an ANE (resp., an AE if, in addition, G is almost connected).
   Furthermore, we prove that if X is an element of G-M then for any closed
   embedding X/G hooked right arrow B in a metrizable space B, there exists
   a closed G-embedding X hooked right arrow Z (a lifting) in a G-space Z
   is an element of G-M such that Z/G is a neighborhood of X/G (resp., Z/G
   = B whenever G is almost connected). If a proper G-space X has
   metrizable orbits and a metrizable orbit space then it is metrizable (by
   a G-invariant metric).},

Abstract = {The present work analyzes the meaning of the Weak Equivalence Principle
   in the context of quantum mechanics. A quantal definition for this

   trajectory and relies upon the phase shift induced by a gravitational
   field in the context of a quantum interference experiment of two

   properties of the system and not to classical concepts as the idea of

Abstract = {The magnetic superconductor UCoGe is analyzed with an electronic
   structure package, spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic repulsion (via
   Hubbard U(H)) were included. The possibility of an antiferromagnetic
   configuration is studied, but it is found to be unstable, also the
   non-collinear magnetization seems to be ruled out. The magnetization is
   given mainly by the Co-atoms with M = 0.6 mu(B)/f.u. The U-atoms have
   two magnetic moments; M = 0.07 and 0.32 mu B/f.u. arranged in an
   alternated planes along the b-direction forming magnetic stripes.},

   applications are organized as a sequence of different stages, which may
   be independent enough to be simultaneously carried out. The original
   Pipes and Filters pattern and the Parallel Pipes and Filters pattern
   describe those actions. We present here the Secure Pipes and Filters
   pattern as a secure version of the original patterns, which contains a
   minimal set of security mechanisms to provide a set of basic security
   functions. The Secure Pipes and Filters pattern includes ways to add
   security controls at each stage of processing, controlling that only
   predefined operations are applied to data streams, as well as securing

Title = {An fMLP receptor is involved in activation of phagocytosis by hemocytes
   from specific insect species},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {728-739},
Abstract = {In mammalian phagocytes, the bacterial formylated peptide fMLP functions
   both as a potent enhancer of phagocytosis and chemoattractant. fMLP has
   been reported to be chemotactic for hemocytes of two marine
   invertebrates, and of the insect Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera). Whether
   fMLP is also able to activate phagocytosis has not been explored in
   hemocytes of any invertebrate. To determine the effect of fMLP on insect
   hemocyte phagocytosis, in vitro phagocytosis assays were performed with
   hemocytes from the insects: Gromphadorhina portentosa (Blattodea),
   Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera), Zophobas morio (Coleoptera), and
   Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera). Phagocytosis of latex, zymosan
   (yeast), Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was measured by flow
   cytometry, in the presence of increasing fMLP concentrations. G.
   portentosa hemocytes showed no enhancement of phagocytosis by fMLP. A.
   domesticus hemocytes had increased phagocytosis of latex and
   Gram-negative bacteria in the presence of fMLP. Z. morio hemocytes
   increased phagocytosis of latex, yeast, and Gram-negative bacteria after
   fMLP stimulation. Galleria mellonella hemocytes increased phagocytosis
   of latex after fMLP stimulation. Treating hemocytes with Pertussis
   toxin, a known inhibitor of the signaling pathway initiated by the
   mammalian fMLP receptor, returned phagocytosis to basal levels. Also,
   hemocytes from all insect species tested presented a similar chemotactic
   response to fMLP. These data suggest that, whereas the ability of
   hemocytes to chemotactically-respond to fMLP is conserved in insects
   ranging from Blattodea to Lepidoptera, the ability to respond to fMLP by
   activating phagocytosis is restricted to specific insect species. (C)

Abstract = {We evaluated the antiproliferative effect of aqueous extracts of 14
   plant foods consumed in Mexico on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The
   plant foods used were avocado, black sapote, guava, mango, prickly pear
   cactus stems (called nopal in Mexico, cooked and raw), papaya,
   pineapple, four different cultivars of prickly pear fruit, grapes and
   tomato. beta-Carotene, total phenolics and gallic acid contents and the
   antioxidant capacity, measured by the ferric reducing/antioxidant power
   and the 2,2-diphenyl-1,1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assays, were
   analyzed in each aqueous extract. Only the papaya extract had a
   significant antiproliferative effect measured with the
   methylthiazolydiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. We did not notice a
   relationship between the total phenolic content and the antioxidant
   capacity with antiproliferative effect. It is suggested that each
   extract of plant food has a unique combination of the quantity and
   quality of phytochemicals that could determine its biological activity.
   Besides, papaya represents a very interesting fruit to explore its
   antineoplastic activities.},

Abstract = {Double electron capture (DEC) by protons from He was studied in
   collisions at energies in the keV regime, theoretically and
   experimentally. Theoretical cross-sections were calculated using the
   electron nuclear dynamic approach and a binomial distribution method in
   the energy range 1-100 keV. Experimental cross-sections were measured by
   means of the grow-rate method in the energy range of 4-10 keV. The
   cross-sections measured are consistent with those of the previous data
   at the high energies of the measured interval and show a different trend
   for the low energy. This behavior is consistent with those of other DEC
   cross-sections measured by protons from He-like targets. With the two
   collision models, it is proven that the reference data for this system
   are consistent only with the assumption of uncorrelated electrons and
   with independent target-projectile nuclei dynamics.},

Abstract = {The role in superconductors of hole-Cooper-pairs (CPs) are examined and
   contrasted with the more familiar electron-CPs, with special emphasis on
   their ``background{''} effect in enhancing superconducting transition
   temperatures T-c even when electron-CPs drive the transition. Both kinds
   of CPs are, of course, present at all temperatures. An analogy is drawn
   between the hole of CPs in any many-fermion system with the antibosons
   in a relativistic ideal Bose gas that appear in substantial numbers only
   at higher and higher temperatures. Their indispensable role in yielding
   a lower Helmholtz free energy equilibrium state is established. For
   superconductors, the problem is viewed in terms of a generalized
   Bose-Einstein condensation (CBEC) theory that is an extension of the
   Friedberg T.D. Lee 1989 boson-fermion BEC theory of high-T-c
   superconductors in that in GBEC theory includes hole CPs as well as
   electron-CPs thereby containing as well as further extending BCS theory
   to higher temperatures with the same weak-coupling electron-phonon
   interaction parameters. We show that the Helmholtz free energy of both
   2c- and 2h-CP pure condensates has a positive second derivative, and are
   thus stable equilibrium states. Finally, it is conjectured that the role
   of hole pairs in ultra cold fermionic atom gases will likely be
   neligible because the very low densities involved imply a ``shallow{''}
   Fermi sea.},

   the main evolutionary concepts in school, most particularly the one of
   natural selection. We will draft some explanations for the obstacles

   issue which are invalid from the current evolutionary biology point of
   view and that even remain among undergraduate students. Those
   difficulties identified in the learning process are then linked to the
   historical reconstruction of evolutionary theory by variation and
   natural selection. We support some proposals and highlight some
   must-answer question for further development in this field.},

Title = {High levels of gene flow and low population genetic structure related to
   high dispersal potential of a tropical marine angiosperm},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {390},
Pages = {67-77},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are traditionally considered to be highly connected,
   caused by long-distance movements of propagules in an open fluid medium.
   But this principle is not universal, and populations of many marine
   organisms have restricted gene-flow, including ones with drifting
   propagules. Direct tracking of marine free-floating propagules over
   large distances is virtually impossible, but long-distance dispersal
   (LDD) can be deduced from their drifting time and transport rates.
   Alternatively, LDD can be estimated as genetic exchange with the use of
   allelic frequency data obtained with genetic markers. The present study
   compares both approaches of LDD estimation for the tropical seagrass
   Thalassia testudinum. Fruit dispersal potential was measured in Puerto
   Morelos reef lagoon, Mexico. Between 10 and 15\% of the fruits floated
   to the surface (floating potential <1 to 10 d), with a derived potential
   dispersal of <1 to 360 km. The remainder of the fruits dehisced in situ
   followed by limited seed dispersal (<1 to 10 m). Genetic diversity was
   characterized using 6 microsatellite loci for 16 populations distributed
   along a 1350 km long stretch of the Mexican coast, revealing a total of
   58 alleles. AMOVA showed that only 9.75\% of the total variation was
   accounted for by genetic differences between the populations. Isolation
   by distance was significant, and revealed a panmictic area of 350 km.
   The results of both approaches of LDD estimation coincided well and the
   maximum displacement of the fruits of this marine angiosperm exceeded,
   by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, the reported seed dispersal by
   terrestrial seed plants.},

   not evolved in the absence of a genetic replicating mechanism insuring
   the stability and diversification of its basic components. This does not
   imply that explanations on the appearance of life should reduce
   themselves to the issue of the emergence of RNA or its predecessors.},

Abstract = {Thanks to the availability of high-throughput omics data, bioinformatics
   approaches are able to hypothesize thus-far undocumented genetic
   interactions. However, due to the amount of noise in these data,
   inferences based on a single data source are often unreliable. A popular
   approach to overcome this problem is to integrate different data
   sources. In this study, we describe DISTILLER, a novel frame work for
   data integration that simultaneously analyzes microarray and motif
   information to find modules that: consist. of genes that are
   co-expressed in a subset of conditions, and their corresponding
   regulators. By applying our method on publicly available data, we
   evaluated the condition-specific transcriptional network of Escherichia
   coli. DISTILLER confirmed 62\% of 736 interactions described in
   RegulonDB, and 278 novel interactions v,,ere predicted.},

Abstract = {The red grouper Epinephelus morio fishery in the Campeche Bank, northern
   coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, is overfished. The main causes are high
   fishing pressure in areas of reproductive aggregation and juvenile
   nursery zones. An analysis of the spatial-seasonal variation in
   catchability was undertaken using data from 1973 to 1977, with the aim
   to detect areas of higher vulnerability to fishing, taking into account
   the red grouper developmental stages (juvenile, pre-adults, and adults).
   Results showed that the adult catchability was higher during the
   reproductive period (January-March) in the eastern part of the Campeche
   Bank. High catchability zones for juveniles were found along the year in
   coastal areas near Celestun, Dzilam de Bravo, Rio Lagartos, and El Cuyo.
   We recommend these locations to be considered as fishing restricted
   areas to reduce fishing mortality and promote stock recovery.},

Abstract = {Based on previous work in which we proposed midgut as a putative
   peripheral oscillator responsible for circadian reduced glutathione
   (GSH) crayfish status, herein we investigated the retina and optic
   lobe-brain (OL-B) circadian GSH system and its ability to deal with
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced as a consequence of metabolic
   rhythms and light variations. We characterized daily and antioxidant
   circadian variations of the different parameters of the glutathione
   system, including GSH, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione
   reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as metabolic
   and lipoperoxidative circadian oscillations in retina and OL-B,
   determining internal and external GSH-system synchrony. The results
   demonstrate statistically significant bi- and unimodal daily and
   circadian rhythms in all GSH-cycle parameters, substrates and enzymes in
   OL-B and retina, as well as an apparent direct effect of light on these
   rhythms, especially in the retina. The luminous condition appears to
   stimulate the GSH system to antagonize ROS and lipid peroxidation (LPO)
   daily and circadian rhythms occurring in both structures, oscillating
   with higher LPO under dark conditions. We suggest that the difference in
   the effect of light on GSH rhythmic mechanisms of both structures for
   antagonizing ROS could be due to differences in glutathione-system
   coupling strength with the circadian clock.},

Abstract = {Reports of epibiosis between ciliated protozoans and aquatic true bugs
   are scarce. The suctorian ciliates Discophrya elongata and Acineta
   tuberosa are recorded for the first time as epibionts of Corisella

   relationship between the architecture of the middle legs and the
   prevalence of ciliates and present data for their distribution,
   prevalence, mean abundance, intensity and density on host appendages.
   Discophrya elongata showed a prevalence of 71.5\% on hosts, being
   attached mainly to middle legs (84\%), occurring in highest abundance on
   the middle femur (mean 112) and attaching with greatest density on the
   middle tibia. Acineta tuberosa was observed only on 12 individuals of
   Corisella edulis and its prevalence was lower than that of D. elongata.
   These are the first worldwide records of such protozoans being
   associated with corixids as epibionts.},

Abstract = {A well known example in quantum electrodynamics (QED) shows that Coulomb
   scattering of unpolarized electrons, calculated to lowest order in
   perturbation theory, yields a results that exactly coincides (in the
   non-relativistic limit) with the Rutherford formula. We examine an
   analogous example, the classical and perturbative quantum scattering of
   an electron by a magnetic field confined in an infinite solenoid of
   finite radius. The results obtained for the classical and the quantum
   differential cross sections display marked differences. While this may
   not be a complete surprise, one should expect to recover the classical
   expression by applying the classical limit to the quantum result. This
   turn not to be the case. Surprisingly enough, it is shown that the
   classical result can not be recuperated even if higher order corrections
   are included. To recover the classic correspondence of the quantum
   scattering problem a suitable non-perturbative methodology should be
   applied.},

Abstract = {Antibacterial peptides are researched mainly for the potential benefit
   they have in a variety of socially relevant diseases, used by the host
   to protect itself from different types of pathogenic bacteria. We used
   the mathematical-computational method known as Hidden Markov models
   (HMMs) in targeting a subset of antibacterial peptides named Selective
   Cationic Amphipatic Antibacterial Peptides (SCAAPs). The main difference
   in the implementation of HMMs was focused on the detection of SCAAP
   using principally five physical-chemical properties for each candidate
   SCAAPs, instead of using the statistical information about the amino
   acids which form a peptide. By this method a cluster of antibacterial
   peptides was detected and as a result the following were found: 9
   SCAAPs, 6 synthetic antibacterial peptides that belong to a subregion of
   Cecropin A and Magainin 2, and 19 peptides from the Cecropin A family. A
   scoring function was developed using HMMs as its core, uniquely
   employing information accessible from the databases.},

   Related concepts are defined in article by Bican et al. {[}2] and by Van
   den Berg and Wisbauer {[}9]. For any ring, we compare the least
   semiprime preradical, the Jacobson radical and the join of all nilpotent
   preradicals, and we characterize V-rings in terms of these three
   preradicals. We study the least semiprime preradical above any
   preradical and we prove some of its properties. Using ``Amitsur
   constructions{''} we define another related operators and prove some of
   their properties.},

Title = {Contribution of Mycorrhizae to Early Growth and Phosphorus Uptake by a
   Neotropical Palm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {855-866},
Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can act as an extension of the root
   system of their host plants. In Desmoncus orthacanthos Martius
   (Arecaceae), which has thick and unbranched roots (i.e., magnolioid
   roots) and low densities of root hairs, this association may be
   essential to reach a maximum growth with minimum fertilizers. This is
   important because of the potential in the south of Mexico to use D.
   orthacanthos' shoots as a raw material to build handcrafts. To evaluate
   the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizae on phosphorus (P) uptake and
   initial growth of D. orthacanthos seedlings, a 160-day bi-factorial
   experiment was carried out in which plants were subject to one of two
   levels of mycorrhizal colonization (with or without) and one of three
   levels of P substrate addition (4, 12, and 24 ppm). Our results show
   that total dry weight (DW) and leaf area (LA) responded significantly to
   P addition but not to mycorrhizal colonization. Phosphorus concentration
   in plant tissues (Pt) was increased by both factors (mycorrhizae and P
   addition). Mycorrhizae increased relative growth rate (RGR) at low P
   level. Our results indicate that AMF play an important role in early
   growth and P uptake by D.orthacanthos seedlings; therefore, the AMF must
   be considered in plantations of this potentially economically important
   palm.},

Title = {Fractionation analysis of trace metals in humic substances of soils

Abstract = {The Mezquital Valley in Central Mexico has received wastewater from
   Mexico City for nearly 100 years. Wastewater brings in organic matter
   and nutrients but also trace metals. Humic substances, the main
   components of organic soil matter, are responsible for retaining and
   regulating the mobility of trace metals in soils. In this study, humic
   substances were extracted from the soil and separated into distinct
   fractions (humic acids, fulvic acids and humins). The particle induced
   X-ray emission (PIXE) technique was applied to determine the metal
   content in bulk soil as well as in humic acids and fulvic acids not
   soluble in H3PO4. In order to assess whether the long-term input of
   organic matter and metals modifies the metal association with these
   humic substances, parcels irrigated for three time periods (5,47 and 89
   years)were selected for this study. It was observed that metals such as
   Zn and Cu are mainly associated with the humic acids. Fulvic acids
   retain mainly Cr while Pb is distributed among humic and fulvic acids.
   It was also observed that in general, metal retention by humic
   substances increases with irrigation time. Depth also affects metal
   association with the humic substances. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Effects of land use change on the hypothetical habitat availability for
   Mexican parrots. - Habitat loss is one of the main threats for
   Neotropical parrots, being human-induced land use change a key issue. In
   this paper, we analyze the modification of vegetation cover for three
   time periods (1976, 1996, and 2000) upon the hypothetical distribution
   of 22 Mexican parrot species, through the use of ecological niche
   modeling (GARP). With the exception of three species, all others incur
   losses in the distribution areas under the land use change scenarios,
   with up to 86\% loss for Ara macao. For Aratinga strenua, Brotogeris
   jugularis, and Amazona auropalliata, all distributed in the southern
   coastal region of Mexico, an apparent recovery in area exists. We also
   analyze the modifications in species richness patterns for Mexican
   psittacids under the same scenarios and the role of protected areas as
   zones of potential habitat conservation.},

Abstract = {The annual replacement of feathers (molt) is a key event in the avian
   life cycle. We describe the duration and intensity of the primary
   feather molt in 12 resident birds of west Mexico and eight Neotropical
   migrant birds that molt in the monsoon region of west Mexico. During our
   fieldwork, we found evidence of flight feather molt occurring at the
   same time as reproduction (molt-breeding overlap) in four resident
   species, Rose-throated Becard (Pachyramphus aglaiae), Verdin (Auriparus
   flaviceps), Grayish Saltator (Saltator coerulescens), Rufous-winged
   Sparrow (Aimophila carpalis), and likely in Gila Woodpecker (Melanerpes
   uropygialis). To compare molts between species, we regressed 1)
   estimates of primary molt duration on body size and 2) estimates of
   primary molt intensity on body size. Duration of primary molt increases
   slightly, but not significantly, with body size. Birds that overlap
   primary molt and breeding replace approximately 10\% fewer feathers at
   once (about 1 feather less), than birds that do not overlap molt and
   breeding. Finally, we compare primary molt intensity (the number of
   primaries molted simultaneously) and primary molt duration to show that
   molt duration was inversely related to molt intensity. To our knowledge,
   this is the first comparative analysis to show that the time required to
   replace the primaries is inversely related to the number of primaries
   growing simultaneously in species that fly while molting. Accepted 19
   October 2009.},

Abstract = {Due to cattle ranching and agriculture, natural environments have been
   transformed into fragmented landscapes. Anthropogenic disturbance
   affects vegetation structure and microclimate, and changes patterns of
   snake diversity. This study determines snakes diversity in four habitats
   that differ in degree of anthropogenic disturbance onGorgona Island, in
   the Colombian pacific. Visual encounter surveys were conducted during
   June-July 2001 and February-April 2004 along 31 linear transects,
   encountering 51 individuals belonging to 13 snake species. We determined
   inventory completeness to be between 60 and 78\%. Highest species
   richness was found in the secondary forest followed by primary forest
   and coconut plantations (eight, six and six species, respectively).
   Highest species complementarity was detected between the prison and
   coconut plantations, and the prison and primary forest. In conserved
   habitats (secondary and primary forests) snake diversity doubled, while
   in the prison and coconut plantations snake abundance increased during
   the dry season. It is possible that anthropogenic disturbance negatively
   affects Leptophis ahaetulla, Micrurus dumerili, Oxybelis brevirostris
   and Tantilla longifrontalis snake species. It is important to invest
   more effort in snake capture in conserved environments than in disturbed
   habitats. Data on spatio-temporal dynamics in snake ensembles are
   essential to correctly focus conservation plans and management of the
   snake fauna in disturbed environments.},

Abstract = {As a function of the water quality provided by square, circular and oval
   experimental ponds, the growth, survival and oxygen requirements in
   epibenthic postlarvae of Farfantepenaeus aztecus were analysed in
   relation to their routine metabolism and apparent heat increment.
   Temperature, oxygen concentration, pH and salinity were measured daily
   in two experimental ponds of each shape. The postlarvae oxygen
   consumption during two 24-h cycles, their growth, physiological
   condition and survival and the productivity in the ponds were estimated.
   Low values of pH, oxygen concentration and phytobenthos productivity,
   and reduced postlarvae relative growth and survival were observed in the
   square ponds. We suggest that the latter results from a deficient water
   circulation related to the effect of the pond's shape on dissolved
   oxygen levels and, consequently, on growth and survival. The postlarvae
   routine metabolism, including feeding, varied between 1.91 and 2.25 mg
   O-2 h(-1) g(-1) wet weight, whereas the minimum oxygen concentration
   needed in the ponds is approximately 4.25 mg O-2 L-1. These conditions
   were achieved in the oval ponds concurrent with higher survival and
   growth values, in which individuals distributed randomly, for which we
   suggest that oval-shaped ponds could be the most adequate for the
   culture of this and other penaeid species.},

Abstract = {Growth responses, survival, and herbivory, on seedlings of Brosimum
   alicastrum were studied in a neotropical Mexican forest. We selected 122
   seedlings and divided them into three groups assigned to defoliation
   treatments: control or 0 (n=21), 50 (n=51) and 90\% (n=50). Every 4
   months during two years we measured seedling growth (in terms of
   relative growth rate in biomass, leaf area growth, produced leaves and
   height growth) and survival. In addition, we evaluated every 12 months
   pathogen damage and insect herbivory using a 2 mm(-2) grid. Separately,
   we estimated mammal herbivory in 3-month old seedlings that were
   selected within a plot of 500 m x 10 m (N=1095). Pathogen damage and
   insect herbivory were evaluated within the same plot in 113 seedlings.
   We found that 50 \% defoliated seedlings showed compensatory responses
   in all growth parameters. Relative growth rate and height growth also
   had a compensatory response in seedlings at 90\% defoliation. Relative
   growth rate and leaf area growth gradually decreased with time although
   height growth seedling showed an opposite pattern. Leaves produced were
   not affected by time. Estimated seedling survival probability increased
   with defoliation to a maximum of 97\%, decreasing at 24 month to 37\%.
   Mammal herbivory was more frequent and severe than herbivory caused by
   pathogens and insects. In some cases, mammal herbivory produced total
   defoliation. Compensatory growth in leaf area growth, produced leaves
   and height growth seedling suggest a synergic compensatory mechanism
   expressed in a whole-plant growth biomass (relative growth rate).
   Compensation and survival results suggest trade-offs at the leaf level,
   such as leaf area growth and produced leaves versus chemical defenses,
   respectively. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (4): 2055-2067. Epub 2008 December 12.},

Abstract = {In this work, a theoretical analysis is developed to predict the
   decomposition temperature of methane gas, CH4, in a planar
   stagnation-point flow over a catalytic carbon surface. Hydrogen is
   produced (without CO2 as a byproduct) by means of a heterogeneous
   reaction mechanism, which is modeled with five heterogeneous reactions,
   including adsorption and desorption reactions. The mass species,
   momentum, and energy conservation equations for the gas phase are
   solved, taking into account that the temperature of decomposition is
   characterized by the Damkohler number Therefore the critical temperature
   conditions or the catalytic thermal decomposition are found by using a
   high activation energy analysis for the desorption kinetics of the
   adsorbed hydrogen component, H(s). Specifically, the numerical
   estimations show that, for increasing values of the velocity gradient
   associated with the stagnation flow, the temperature of decomposition
   grows, depending on the surface coverages of the product species. (C)

Abstract = {the structural and ultrastructural features of gonads from endemic
   Mexican fish have received scarce attention. This study describes the
   histological and ultrastructural characteristics of the oocyte in
   Chirostoma humboldtianum. The ovary is asynchronic, and as such, most
   phases of oocyte development are found in the same ovary. The complete
   process of oogenesis was divided in five stages: oogonium and
   folliculogenesis, primary growth, cortical alveoli and lipid inclusions,
   vitellogenesis and maturation. The presence of big filaments, which
   appear at the end of primary growth, induces some common follicular
   adaptation. During primary growth, abundant ribosomes, rough endoplasmic
   reticulum, and mitochondria are grouped in the cytoplasm. At the end of
   this stage, the 71 layer of the chorion is developed, while microvilli
   start to be evident as well. In the cortical alveoli and lipid droplets
   phase, intense PAS positive vesicles, some of them containing nucleoid
   material, are observed in the peripheral cytoplasm and the lipid
   droplets take a more central position. In vitellogenesis, the proteic
   yolk accumulates in a centripetal way while the chorion is completely
   formed. In maturation, the germinal vesicle migrates to the animal pole,

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive
   fibrotic lung disorder of unknown etiology and unclear pathogenesis.
   Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is strongly upregulated and may
   contribute to the abnormal remodeling that characterizes the disease. We
   conducted a case-control study of 130 IPF patients and 305 healthy
   controls to investigate associations between two polymorphisms of the
   MMP-1 gene promoter and IPF risk. First, using PCR-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis we studied the 2G polymorphism
   at -1,607, shown previously to generate the core of an AP-1 binding site
   and correlate with high transcriptional activity and risk for IPF. The
   frequency of the 2G/2G genotype was higher in IPF than in controls (63
   vs. 49\%; P < 0.008; OR = 1.7; CI 1.15-2.79). Next, we studied a T/G SNP
   at position -755, which we identified by sequencing the MMP-1 promoter.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay performed on IPF fibroblasts
   with either -755 genotype revealed an AP-1 binding site for TT-755 and
   GT-755 genotypes. The frequency of this SNP revealed no significant
   differences between IPF and healthy controls. However, when the study
   individuals were stratified by their smoking status, a significant
   increase in the T/T genotype frequency was observed in smoking cases
   compared with smoking controls (45 vs. 26\%; P = 0.03; OR = 2.3; CI
   1.15-4.97). These findings indicate that polymorphisms of the MMP-1
   promoter may confer increased risk for IPF and reveal a putative
   gene-environment interaction between the -755 MMP-1 polymorphism and
   smoking in this disease.},

Abstract = {Independently, chronic protein malnutrition and aging have been shown to
   affect locomotor activity (LA) and body temperature (BT) rhythms in

   and other circadian parameters between LA and BT rhythms. Chronic
   protein malnourished (PM) and well-nourished (WN) male Sprague-Dawley
   rats (550-590 days of age) were implanted with activity-temperature
   intraperitoneal radio transmitters (Mini Mitter) and exposed to
   different lighting protocols during at least 10 days - light-dark cycles
   (LD 12: 12), constant darkness (DD), skeleton photoperiod (SP) and again
   LD. Results indicate that parametric entrainment, achieved by means of
   complete photoperiod, is not negatively affected in malnourished rats;
   however, it is affected under non-parametric entrainment like SP. A
   different free running period between the LA and BT circadian rhythms
   was detected for well-nourished and malnourished aged rats.},

Abstract = {The efficacy of biological control of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using
   Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is analyzed. This approach has shown to
   be very efficient on agricultural plagues and has become an alternative
   control strategy to the usual technique of insecticide application,
   which promotes resistance against chemical controls and is harmful to
   other species that live in the same mosquito habitat. By using a
   discrete cellular automata approach we have shown that in the case of
   Aedes aegypti, the spatially heterogeneous distribution of oviposition
   containers and the mosquito behavior, especially with respect to mating,
   make the application of STI difficult or impracticable.},

Abstract = {We report on the photoconductive response of nanostructured sol-gel
   films in function of the silver nitrate concentration (ions and
   colloids). Silver colloids were obtained by spontaneous reduction

   films were prepared by dip-coating method using the non-ionic diblock
   copolymer Brij58 to produce channels into the film, which house the
   silver nanoparticles. An optical absorption band located at 430 nm was
   detected by optical absorption; it corresponds to the surface plasmon. A
   fit to this band with modified Gans theory is presented.
   Photoconductivity studies were performed on films with silver ions and
   films with silver colloids to characterize their mechanisms of charge
   transport in the darkness and under illumination at 420 and 633 nm
   wavelengths. The films with silver colloids exhibit a photovoltaic
   effect stronger than the films with silver ions. While a photoconductive
   behaviour is observed in the films with silver ions.},

Abstract = {Sol-gel thin films containing Fe2O3 were deposited onto glass substrates
   by the dip-coating method at room temperature. Fe2O3 enriched with the
   isotope Fe-57 was embedded in two kinds of matrices: zinc oxide (ZnO)
   and silica (SiO2). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for morphology and
   structure determination of the nanostructures and showed that the ZnO
   exhibit a wurtzite form when the film is annealed at 450 degrees C for
   20 min. SiO2 thin films at C16H33PEO20:Fe2O3 = 1:2.7 x 10(-1) molar
   concentration exhibit a hexagonal nanophase produced by the diblock
   copolymer Brij58 (C16H33PEO20). Optical absorption and infrared
   spectroscopy techniques were used to evaluate the optical quality of the
   films. In order to determine if the Fe2O3 Was incorporated into the
   matrices, room temperature Mossbauer spectra of both samples were
   obtained. In both cases the hematite spectrum was obtained,
   corroborating that the incorporation of the Fe2O3 to the matrices was
   done without chemical reaction whatsoever.},

Abstract = {In 1658, Blaise Pascal put forward a challenge for solving the area
   under a segment of a cycloid and also its center of gravity. In 1659,
   motivated by Pascal challenge, Huygens showed experimentally that the
   cycloid is the solution to the tautochrone problem, namely that of
   finding a curve such that the time taken by a particle sliding down to
   its lowest point, under uniform gravity, is independent of its starting
   point. Ever since, this problem has appeared in many books and papers
   that show different solutions. In particular, the fractional derivative
   formalism has been used to solve the problem for an arbitrary potential
   and also to put forward the inverse problem: what potential is needed in
   order for a particular trajectory to be a tautochrone? Unfortunately,
   the fractional derivative formalism is not a regular subject in the
   mathematics curricula for physics at most of the Universities we know.
   In this work we develop an approach that uses the well-known Laplace
   transform formalism together with the convolution theorem to arrive at
   similar results.},

Abstract = {A review of recent advances in the theoretical analysis of nuclear mass
   models and their predictive power is presented. After introducing two
   tests which probe the ability of nuclear mass models to extrapolate,
   three models are analyzed in detail: the liquid drop model (LDM), the
   liquid drop model plus empirical shell corrections (LDMM) and the
   Duflo-Zuker mass formula (DZ). The DZ model is exhibited as the most
   predictive model. The Garvey-Kelson mass relations are also discussed.
   It is shown that their fulfillment probes the consistency of the most
   commonly used mass formulae, and that they can be used in an iterative
   process to predict nuclear masses in the neighborhood of nuclei with
   measured masses, offering a simple and reproducible procedure for short
   range mass predictions.},

Abstract = {Although the capacity of isolated beta-subunits of the ATP
   synthase/ATPase to perform catalysis has been extensively studied, the
   results have not conclusively shown that the subunits are catalytically
   active. Since soluble F-1 of mitochondrial H+-ATPase can bind inorganic
   pyrophosphate (PPi) and synthesize PPi from medium phosphate, we
   examined if purified His-tagged beta-subunits from Thermophilic bacillus
   PS3 can hydrolyze PPi. The difference spectra in the near UV CD of
   beta-subunits with and without PPi show that PPi binds to the subunits.
   Other studies show that beta-subunits hydrolyze {[}P-32] PPi through a
   Mg2+-dependent process with an optimal pH of 8.3. Free Mg2+ is required
   for maximal hydrolytic rates. The Km for PPi is 75 mu M and the Vmax is
   800 pmol/min/mg. ATP is a weak inhibitor of the reaction, it diminishes
   the Vmax and increases the Km for PPi. Thus, isolated beta-subunits are
   catalytically competent with PPi as substrate; apparently, the assembly
   of beta-subunits into the ATPase complex changes substrate specificity,
   and leads to an increase in catalytic rates.},

Abstract = {Papilionoidea from Sierra de Huautla, Morelos and Puebla, Mexico
   (Insecta: Lepidoptera). The Cuenca del Balsas region has significant
   biodiversity and endemicity of its herpetofauna, avifauna and vascular
   plants. Despite this, our knowledge of the Papilionoidea of the region
   is poor. We analyzed the local and temporal distribution of
   Papilionoidea at 24 localities in the states of Morelos and Puebla. The
   study sites are situated between 900 and 1300 m. a. s. l., and are
   composed of dry tropical forest (dtf). We recorded 8790 individuals of
   83 genera and 142 species of Papilionoidea (sensu Kristensen, 1975),
   over 79 days of field work, with 2-4 days at each of the 24 localities.
   Twenty five species were newly recorded for the state of Puebla. Our
   data render Morelos and Puebla among the seven richest Mexican states,
   in terms of Papilionoidea diversity. Our results show that the Sierra de
   Huautla has the lowest diversity, but the highest standard abundance,
   compared to other Mexican regions with similar vegetation. Patterns of
   diversity and seasonal abundance are atypical, in that individuals of
   many species are unusually abundant during the wet months. Rev. Biol.

Abstract = {In this study, 231 Y chromosomes from 12 populations were typed for four
   diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine
   haplogroup membership and 43 Y chromosomes from three of these
   populations were typed for eight short tandem repeats (STRs) to
   determine haplotypes. These data were combined with previously published
   data, amounting to 724 Y chromosomes from 26 populations in North
   America, and analyzed to investigate the geographic distribution of Y
   chromosomes among native North Americans and to test the Southern
   Athapaskan migration hypothesis. The results suggest that European
   admixture has significantly altered the distribution of Y chromosomes in
   North America and because of this caution should be taken when inferring
   prehistoric population events in North America using Y chromosome data
   alone. However, consistent with studies of other genetic systems, we are
   still able to identify close relationships among Y chromosomes in
   Athapaskans from the Subarctic and the Southwest, suggesting that a
   small number of proto-Apachean migrants from the Subarctic founded the
   Southwest Athapaskan populations. Am J Phys Anthropol 137:412-424, 2008.

Title = {Double capture cross sections in p-Ar collisions},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW A},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {78},
Number = {6, A},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {p-Ar collisions are investigated theoretically and experimentally at
   impact energies in the keV regime. Total cross sections for double
   electron capture of p on Ar are calculated by an independent-particle
   method in the impact energy range 3-100 keV. We have measured the
   absolute differential and total cross sections for double electron
   capture for 1.0-5.0-keV p-Ar collisions. The absolute differential cross
   section (DCS) for all the collision energies considered shows a
   decreasing behavior with increasing angle, exhibiting an overall
   decrease of three orders of magnitude. The integrated DCS is found to be
   between the range of 0.7x10(-2) and 4.5x10(-2) A(2), displays an
   increasing behavior as a function of the incident energy, and merges
   with previous data at the high-energy side. The theoretical total cross
   sections reproduce the structures around 5 keV and 15 keV reported by
   other available measurements. The analysis of the capture into the
   1s(1)4s(1) hydrogen-like configuration points in the direction of a
   common origin for these peaks.},

Abstract = {Transient laminar mixed convection in an asymmetrically and
   differentially heated vertical channel of finite length subject to an
   opposing buoyancy is investigated by solving the unsteady
   two-dimensional Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Results illustrate
   the effects of buoyancy strength or Richardson number Ri = Gr/Re-2 and
   Reynolds number Re on the overall flow structure and the nondimensional
   heat flux (Nusselt number) from the heated surface. Final steady or
   oscillatory flow response is obtained depending on the value of the
   Reynolds and Richardson numbers. The critical value of the buoyancy
   strength between the two regimes strongly depends on the value of the
   Reynolds number. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {PLANT DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT IN THE YAXCHILAN NATURAL MONUMENT, CHIAPAS,

Year = {2008},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {53-76},

Abstract = {We assessed the diversity of vascular plains in the Yaxchilan Natural
   Monument, a nature protection area located in Chiapas State, southern
   Mexico. A checklist including 547 species (337 genera, 102 families) was
   produced by combining information derived from three sources: (1) an
   initial list derived from an ecological Study on forest structure; (2) a
   systematic survey conducted over an 18-month period; and (3) an extra
   visit to the site as part of,I more ambitious project covering the
   entire Lacandon rain forest region. February was the month in which the
   largest number of fertile vouchers was collected in two consecutive
   years. The families with greatest richness were Fabaceae (47 species),
   Orchidaceae (34), Rubiaceae (23), and Asteraceae (22). The most speciose
   genera were Piper (13 species), Psychotria (9), Adiantum and Peperomia
   (8). Trees were the largest growth form group (203 species), followed by
   terrestrial herbs (129). Most species (459) were encountered in primary,
   closed forest, but secondary vegetation contributed 125 species. An
   estimation of the total size of Yaxchilan flora obtained through the
   Chao 2 algorithm indicated that this protected area may host more than
   850 plant species. Despite its relatively small area, the Yaxchilan
   Natural Monument hosts a considerable biodiversity, representing over
   16.2\% of the recorded flora in the entire Selva Lacandona region, and
   over 7.2\% of the State flora.},

Title = {Distributional patterns of the strictly aquatic vascular flora in the

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Patterns of distribution and richness of strictly aquatic vascular
   plants of the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, were analyzed. We registered
   93 species of strictly aquatic vascular plants, which 62 are typical
   from lentic environments. The Rio Tamesi sub-basin contains the highest
   number of species (68, 73.1\%), There are no endemic species to the
   state of Tamaulipas, but we found 2 species endemic to Mexico (Lobelia
   purpusii and Oserya coulteriana). Twenty nine species (31.2\%) are
   considered rare, because they are present in a single sub-basin; only 2
   species are widely distributed in most of them (Bacopa monnieri and
   Echinodorus berteroi). A parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) of the
   hydrological sub-basins represented in this state based on the shared
   presence of species suggested that the strictly aquatic vascular plants
   have a nested distributional pattern. We conclude that these plants in
   Tamaulipas are part of the same floristic unit and that their
   distribution follow altitudinal, latitudinal and climatic gradients.},

Abstract = {The morphogenesis of the sexual phase of seven species of Thelypteris
   subg. Cyclosorus (Thelypteridaceae) is described and compared. Spores of
   all species are monolete, ellipsoid and have positive photoblastism.
   They have Vittaria-type germination, germinal filaments are short and
   uniseriate, and Aspidium-type development. Adult gametophytes are
   spatulate-cordiform, and have wide wings with numerous glandular,
   marginal and superficial hairs. Antheridia have a narrow or widened
   basal cell, an undivided annular cell, and an opercular cell;
   antherozoids are liberated through three mechanisms. Archegonia have
   short necks and four triangular cells on the neck's mouth. The
   sporophyte's first leaf is lobed, with open dichotomous veins, glandular
   hairs similar to those of the gametophyte, and anomocytic stomata.
   Differences observed between the studied species are: spore size;
   ornamentation of the perispore; germination and emergence periods; size
   of hairs; developmental period of gametangia; and antherozoid liberation
   mechanisms through total detachment of the operculum, partial detachment
   of the operculurn, and development of an apical pore through tearing of
   the operculum. These taxonomically valuable characters, combined with
   the sporophyte characteristics, can be useful tools in the
   identification of the species studied to the subg. Cyclosorus. (C) 2008

Abstract = {The Faculty of Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico
   was founded with seven scientific careers, and the astronomer and
   physicists majors were two of them. But because of the subjects in each
   of these careers were almost the same, both of thern were established
   just as a Physics in 1967 (considering Astronomy as an specialty). This
   was justified because in the Astronomy career were no graduated Students
   at that time. In fact the students interested in Astronomy field
   finished the mayor in Physics and then elaborate a thesis work in
   Astronomy from their final dissertation.},

Abstract = {Three experimental diets were probed for the growth and survival rates
   of young Octopus maya (Voss and Solis 1966), using two inert foods (A2 =
   shrimp pellets, A3 = Surimi) and one alive food (A1 = Artemia), under
   controlled conditions. The results showed significant differences
   between the live food and the inert ones. Young octopus feed with
   artemia, reported better growth in weight gained compared with the inert
   diets (A1 = 11.88 g, A2 = 8.9 g, 43 = 8.83 g). All three diets obtained
   low survivorships, being the alive food the best one with a rate of
   61.3\%, followed by surimi with 42.3\%, and finally the pellet food with
   27.6\%. Statistical analysis showed differences (p > 0.05) between all
   the treatments for both growth and survival results. Artificial feeding
   of O. maya in captivity still requires many efforts to develop a food
   suitable for this organism, nutritional formulation, attractants, size,
   among others should be developed.},

Abstract = {We show, both heuristically and numerically, that three-dimensional
   periodic Lorentz gases-clouds of particles scattering off crystalline
   arrays of hard spheres-often exhibit normal diffusion, even when there
   are gaps through which particles can travel without ever colliding-i.e.,
   when the system has an infinite horizon. This is the case provided that
   these gaps are not ``too large,{''} as measured by their dimension. The
   results are illustrated with simulations of a simple three-dimensional
   model having different types of diffusive regime and are then extended
   to higher-dimensional billiard models, which include hard-sphere fluids.},

Journal = {NANO LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Pages = {4205-4209},

Abstract = {Based on the Kubo-Greenwood formula, the transport of electrons and
   phonons in nanowires is studied by means of a real-space renormalization
   plus convolution method. This method has the advantage of being
   efficient, without introducing additional approximations and capable to
   analyze nanowires of a wide range of lengths even with defects. The Born
   and tight-binding models are used to investigate the lattice thermal and
   electrical conductivities, respectively. The results show a quantized
   electrical dc conductance, which is attenuated when an oscillating
   electric field is applied. Effects of single and multiple planar
   defects, such as a quasi-periodic modulation, on the conductance of
   nanowires are also investigated. For the low temperature region, the
   lattice thermal conductance reveals a power-law temperature dependence,
   in agreement with experimental data'.},

Abstract = {The exact solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation in one dimension,
   when the square of the velocity is a linear function of the position,

   this solution as the zero order approximation for a perturbation
   expansion and apply it to the case when the square of the velocity can
   be written as a polynomial in the position. The first and second order
   perturbation terms, corresponding to quadratic and cubic terms for the
   square of the velocity, are obtained. A closed formula for the n-order
   correction in terms of integrals of the Bessel functions of the first
   kind was also explicitly obtained, this expression can be solved
   analytically for the first and second order corrections and numerically

Abstract = {A new species of Celotes is described from central Mexico, bringing the
   total number of species in this genus to three. The new Celotes is
   larger and darker than its two congeners, and is immediately
   distinguished from them by a combination of a very long and curved
   projection from the valva, broad valvae, terminally narrowing less
   massive harpe, smaller tegumen and narrower uncus. These abundantly
   distinct genitalic characters, together with whitish, but rounded,
   scales on the dorsal surface of the male metathoracic pouch strongly
   argue for the species-level recognition of this seemingly allopatric
   Celotes phenotype.},

Abstract = {A histological study of the hepatopancreas of the blue crab Callinectes
   sapidus parasitized by the rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus
   was conducted to explore if the degree of development of the parasite's
   rootlet system was correlated to its maturation process as seen by
   external characters of its reproductive body or externa. Four types of
   crabs were examined: control, with virgin and mature externa, and
   scarred. A clear progression with an increase in number and size of the
   parasite's rootlets in the hosts' hepatopancreas can be seen. Although
   the hepatopancreatic tubules remain functional, the hepatopancreas
   appears as a loose structure, completely infiltrated with L. texanus
   rootlets, in advanced stages of the parasitism. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {RNA editing changes the sequence of many transcripts in plant
   organelles, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms
   determining the specificity of the process. In this study, we have
   characterized CLB19 (also known as PDE247), a gene that is required for
   editing of two distinct chloroplast transcripts, rpoA and clpP.
   Loss-of-function clb19 mutants present a yellow phenotype with impaired
   chloroplast development and early seedling lethality under greenhouse
   conditions. Transcript patterns are profoundly affected in the mutant
   plants, with a pattern entirely consistent with a defect in activity of
   the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase. CLB19 encodes a pentatricopeptide
   repeat protein similar to the editing specificity factors CRR4 and
   CRR21, but, unlike them, is implicated in editing of two target sites.},

Abstract = {Many avian species from the temperate zone show low levels of genetic
   diversity when compared with species from the tropics, although there
   are some interesting exceptions, and species whose ranges occur across
   the temperate-tropical boundary could have characteristics of either or
   both zones. The distribution Of the Streak-backed Oriole (Icterus
   pustulatus) extends from northwestern Sonora in Mexico South along the
   Pacific coast to Costa Rica. In addition, there is a Population on the
   Tres Marias Islands. Northern Populations are migratory and dichromatic
   (sexes different), whereas southern populations are nonmigratory and
   monochromatic (sexes alike). We sequenced mtDNA (control region domain
   1) from 102 individuals across the range of this species. Maximum
   parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses did not support the existence
   of multiple species within lcterus pustulatus based on mtDNA. However,
   populations from the Tres Marias Islands seem to have been isolated long
   enough to have fixed differences from populations on the mainland. The
   species complex shows an uncommon phylogeographic pattern, with shallow
   haplotype trees and weak geographic structure, suggesting that it has
   undergone recent population expansion. We recommend that the insular
   populations be considered a separate species, Icterus graysonii, given
   the fixed differences from mainland birds in Multiple characteristics,
   including mtDNA and plumage patterns.},

Abstract = {Cryptochromes (CRY) are proteins with a dual role in the circadian
   function of different animals, participating in phototransduction and
   light signaling to the clock and as a transcriptional repressor that
   provides negative feedback in the clock feedback loop. Here we
   characterize functional expression of CRY as a marker of the
   functionality of the circadian pacemaker of crayfish (Procambarus
   clarkii) throughout postembryonic development. Using different
   experimental light protocols and by means of immunofluorescence and
   biochemical methods, we report that, as in the adult, in young crayfish
   from the first embryonic stage CRY is present in cells adjacent to the
   eyestalk hemiellipsoidal body and the anterior margin of the brain
   protocerebrum. In the brain, CRY cycles after 72 h darkness, entraining
   to LD cycles. Meanwhile, as in the adult eye, in juveniles CRY is driven
   by light, showing an arrhythmic pattern in DD and cycling under LD.
   These results, as well as the completely different period length found
   in the brain circadian oscillations of 2nd post-embryonic stage and
   juvenile animals, suggest important changes in the properties of the
   crayfish pacemaker through the development. Therefore these data support
   a previous idea about the functionality of the circadian system from
   hatching. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Collision-induced fragmentation cross sections of CO2},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW A},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {78},
Number = {5},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A combined experimental and theoretical study of the collision-induced
   dissociation of CO2+ ions colliding with He in the energy range of 1 to
   9 keV has been carried out in this work. Total cross sections for the
   dissociation products O+, C+, and CO+ are presented as a mean to
   investigate the collision dynamics of this molecular ion. A remarkable
   change on the dissociation dynamics is resolved at about similar to 4
   keV collision energy. From the comparison of the measured cross sections
   to a theoretical treatment of the collision process using
   electron-nuclear dynamics, we infer that electronic multireference
   configurations are required in the dynamics at low collision energies.
   For the C+ dissociation product, the collision dynamics is fully
   described by theory with the possible isomerization of the CO2+ being
   discarded at these collision energies. As a consequence of the
   calibration procedure in the experimental method, double electron
   capture cross section for protons on argon are also reported in good
   agreement with other available experiments.},

Abstract = {Sex steroid hormone receptors play a central role in the regulation of
   reproduction in male chickens. In this work, we evaluated by
   histomorphometric methods and Western blot analysis changes in the
   number of the different cell populations and in the content of sex
   steroid hormone receptors in testes from immature (1.5-month-old),
   mature (12-month-old), and aged (48-month-old) chickens. The number of
   Sertoli cells, germ cells, and Leydig cells per area of testicular
   tissue markedly changed according to chicken age. The highest number of
   Sertoli and Leydig cells was found in testes of immature chickens, with
   a dramatic decrease in those of mature chickens; however, the number of
   germ cells was the highest in mature chickens in comparison with other
   ages. The content of androgen receptor disminished in testes of mature
   and aged animals in comparison with that of immature chickens. In
   contrast, the content of estrogen receptor alpha and progesterone
   receptor was higher in testes of mature animals than in other ages. Both
   progesterone receptor isoforms were expressed in a similar proportion in
   testes of immature and mature animals. Interestingly, progesterone
   receptor isoform A was the predominant isoform in aged animals. These
   results suggest that there are marked age-dependent changes in chicken
   testes histology and in sex steroid hormone receptors content that
   should contribute to sex steroid hormone actions, in this tissue
   throughout the lifespan of chickens. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The high-temperature ignition (above 1100 K) of propane and air mixtures
   is studied in this work. The initial detailed mechanism consists of 177
   elementary reactions with 40 species, which reproduces the ignition time
   of propane under a wide range in the parametric space (initial
   temperature, equivalence ratio, pressure). Through a systematic
   reduction strategy, using the classical normalized sensitivity analysis,
   the minimal set of elementary chemical reactions can be reduced to 43
   with 27 species, reproducing the ignition conditions. Basically, the
   ignition delay time corresponds to the depletion time of the propane
   fuel, attacked by radicals, which produces secondary fuels such as
   ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), and acetylene (C2H2), among others,
   which are consumed in times much shorter than the consumption time of
   the primary fuel. Thus, the radical concentrations must be properly
   deduced to describe correctly the ignition delay time. A 15-step global
   reaction mechanism is proposed and tested successfully. (c) 2008 Wiley

Title = {Parthenocarpy and Seed Predation by Insects in Bursera morelensis},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BOTANY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {102},
Number = {5},
Pages = {713-722},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background and Aims While parthenocarpy (meaning the production of
   fruits without seeds) may limit fecundity in many plants, its function
   is not clear; it has been proposed, however, that it might be associated
   with a strategy to avoid seed predation. Bursera morelensis is a
   dioecious endemic plant that produces fruits with and without seeds, and
   its fruits are parasitized by insects. Its reproductive system is not
   well described and no published evidence of parthenocarpy exists for the
   species. The purpose of this work was to describe the breeding system of
   B. morelensis and its relationship to seed predation by insects.
   Methods The breeding system was described using pollination experiments,
   verifying the presence of parthenocarpic fruits and apomictic seeds.
   Reproductive structures from flower buds to mature fruits were
   quantified. For fruits, an anatomical and histological characterization
   was made. The number of fruits in which seeds had been predated by
   insects was correlated with parthenocarpic fruit production.
   Key Results The major abortion of reproductive structures occurred
   during fruit set. The results discard the formation of apomictic seeds.
   Flowers that were not pollinated formed parthenocarpic fruits and these
   could be distinguished during early developmental stages. In
   parthenocarpic fruits in the first stages of development, an unusual
   spread of internal walls of the ovary occurred invading the locule and
   preventing ovule development. Unlike fruits with seeds, parthenocarpic
   fruits do not have calcium oxalate crystals in the ovary wall. Both
   fruit types can be separated in the field at fruit maturity by the
   presence of dehiscence, complete in seeded and partial in parthenocarpic
   fruits. Trees with more parthenocarpic fruits had more parasitized
   fruits.
   Conclusions This is the first time the anatomy of parthenocarpic fruits
   in Burseraceae has been described. Parthenocarpic fruits in B.
   morelensis might function as a deceit strategy for insect seed predators
   as they are unprotected both chemically and mechanically by the absence
   of calcium oxalate crystals.},

Abstract = {Based on the Kubo-Greenwood formula, a novel renormalization plus
   convolution method is developed to investigate impurity effects on the
   electrical conductivity of periodic and aperiodic systems. This method
   combines the convolution theorem with the real-space renormalization
   technique, being able to address multidimensional quasiperiodic systems
   with defects. In this paper, the electronic transport in mirror
   Fibonacci systems with site impurity is investigated in detail. The
   results show that the mirror symmetry in quasiperiodic systems induces a
   large number of transparent states in the de conductivity spectra.
   Moreover, the introduction of symmetrically located impurities in mirror
   Fibonacci chains preserves many of these transparent states. Finally,
   impurity effects on the ac conductivity of quasiperiodic nanowires are
   also analyzed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mechanisms regulating myofibroblastic differentiation of fibroblasts
   within fibroblastic foci in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain
   unclear. Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, produce
   heritable but potentially reversible changes in DNA or its associated
   proteins and are prominent in development and oncogenesis. We have shown
   that Thy-1 suppresses myofibroblastic differentiation of lung
   fibroblasts and that fibroblasts in fibroblastic foci are Thy-1(-).
   Epigenetic down-regulation of Thy-1 has been demonstrated in cellular
   transformation and clinical cancer. We hypothesized that epigenetic
   regulation of Thy-1 affects the lung fibroblast fibrogenic phenotype.
   RT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and bisulfite genomic sequencing
   were used to determine the methylation status of the Thy-1 promoter in
   Thy-1(+) and Thy-1(-) lung fibroblasts, and MSP-in situ hybridization
   (MSPISH) was performed on fibrotic tissue. Thy-1 gene expression is
   absent in Thy-1(-) human and rat fibroblasts despite intact Thy-1
   genomic DNA. Cytosine-guanine islands in the Thy-1 gene promoter are
   hypermethylated in Thy-1(-), but not Thy-1(+), fibroblasts. RT-PCR and
   MSP demonstrate that, in IPF samples in which Thy-1 expression is
   absent, the Thy-1 promoter region is methylated, whereas in lung samples
   retaining Thy-1 expression, the promoter region is unmethylated. MSPISH
   confirms methylation of the Thy-1 promoter in fibroblastic foci in IPF.
   Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors restores Thy-1
   expression in Thy-1(-) fibroblasts. Epigenetic regulation of Thy-1 is a
   novel and potentially reversible mechanism in fibrosis that may offer
   the possibility of new therapeutic options.},

Abstract = {Macrophages play a crucial role in respiratory viral infections.
   However, the mechanisms by which these cells are recruited locally are
   not fully understood. The current authors studied the role of the
   chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, -2, -3 and -4 on
   monocyte/macrophage recruitment during respiratory viral infections.
   Levels of these chemokines were investigated in nasal aspirates from
   6-12-yr-old children suffering from respiratory viral infections, caused
   by rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses
   and respiratory syncytial virus.
   MCP-3 and -4 were significantly higher in samples derived from
   virus-infected children children when they had been asymptomatic.
   Concentrations of both chemokines were found to significantly correlate
   with the number of recruited nasal macrophages. Chemotaxis assays showed
   that purified MCP-3 and -4 from nasal aspirates showed biological
   activity in vitro. There were no significant differences in MCP-1 and -2
   levels between both groups.
   The present data indicates that monocyte chemotactic protein-3 and -4
   may have an important role in macrophage recruitment in children with
   proven upper respiratory viral infections. These chemokines could be
   potential targets for therapeutic intervention in respiratory viral
   infections.},

   in yielding a lower Helmholtz free energy equilibrium state is
   established. For superconductors, the problem is viewed in terms of a
   generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) theory that is an
   extension of the Friedberg-T.D. Lee 1989 boson-fermion BEC theory of
   high-T-c superconductors in that the GBEC theory includes hole CPs as
   well as electron-CPs-thereby containing as well as further extending BCS
   theory to higher temperatures with the same weak-coupling
   electron-phonon interaction parameters. We show that the Helmholtz free
   energy of both 2e- and 2h-CP pure condensates has a positive second
   derivative, and are thus stable equilibrium states. Finally, it is
   conjectured that the role of hole pairs in ultra-cold fermionic atom
   gases will likely be negligible because the very low densities involved
   imply a ``shallow{''} Fermi sea.},

Abstract = {Fe50-xCu50-xB2x alloy was obtained by an aqueous chemical reduction at
   pH=7.0, using fast and slow NaBH4 solution addition methods. According
   to X-ray diffraction patterns, TEM and HRTEM observations, smaller than
   10 nm nanocrystals of fcc-FeCuB were formed when the fast method was
   employed. The room temperature Mossbauer spectrum of this FeCuB
   nanoalloy shows a quadrupole doublet with an isomer shift of 0.355(1)
   mm/s and a quadrupole splitting of 0.772(2) mm/s, and a broadened
   magnetic sextet with a quadrupole splitting of 0.020(3) mm/s and an
   isomer shift of 0.436(5) mm/s, exhibiting a distinctive high average
   magnetic field of 40.57(5) T Grains with a size larger than 10 nm were
   obtained for a slow method nanoalloy, and its Mossbauer spectrum
   consisted only of a broadened sextuplet characteristic of an fcc-FeCuB
   alloy. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the electronic structure and bonding
   characteristics of a series of ternary hydrides composed of transition
   metals (iron, ruthenium, osmium) and different alkaline-earth elements.
   Using first-principle methods to compute the electronic structure, the
   systematic investigation of this isostructural series of compounds
   allows us to establish chemical trends on different properties. We
   extend our investigation to the case of low-symmetry,
   low-hydrogen-coordination ruthenium-based hydrides. We were able to
   systematize the computed properties in terms of
   transition-metal-hydrogen and interlattice interactions. We found that
   the charge state of the transition metal correlates with the hydrogen
   site energy, indicating the importance of the charge redistribution in
   the molecular anions. The H site energy exhibits an interesting
   correlation with the hydride formation enthalpy. The formation enthalpy,
   from the elements, shows a correlation with the interlattice interaction
   energy, indicating the importance of the alkaline-earth sublattice.},

Abstract = {We describe herein the first occurrence of the monogenean Urocleidoides
   vaginoclaustrum in the wild. This monogenean was originally described
   from an aquarium neotropical fish examined in India. Worms were
   collected from the gills of Xiphophorus hellerii, a species native to
   tropical Mexico but introduced to the Los Berros Spring in the State of
   Durango, Northern Mexico. These specimens showed slight morphological
   differences in the sclerotized structures of the haptor with respect to
   the specimens described from India. A brief morphological
   characterization of this species is presented.},

Abstract = {General trends in world biogeographic literature: A preliminary
   bibliometric analysis. Records with the search string biogeograph{*}
   were collected from the Science Citation Index (SCI). A total of 3456
   records were downloaded for the 1945-2006 period from titles of articles
   and reviews, and 10,543 records were downloaded for 1991-2006, taking
   into consideration also abstracts and keywords. Temporal trends of
   publications, geographical and institutional distribution of the
   research output, authorship, and core journals were evaluated. There
   were as many as 122 countries carrying out biogeographic research; in
   the most recent period. USA is the top producing country, followed by
   the United Kingdom, Australia. France, Germany, Spain, and Canada. There
   were 17,493 authors contributing to the field. During 1991-2006 there
   were 4098 organizations with authors involved in biogeographic research;
   institutions with higher number of papers are the Natural History Museum
   (United Kingdom). the University of California, Berkeley (USA), the
   Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (France). the Universidad Nacional
   Autonoma do Mexico (Mexico). the American Museum of Natural History
   (USA) and the Russian Academy of Sciences (Russia). Research articles
   are spread over a variety of journals. with the Journal of Biogeography,
   Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Molecular Ecology, and Biological
   Journal of the Linnean Society being the core journals. From 28,759
   keywords retrieved those with the highest frequency were evolution.
   phylogeny. diversity. mitochondrial DNA, pattern(s), systematics, and
   population(s). We conclude that publications on biogeography have
   increased substantially during the last),cars, especially since 1998.
   The preferred journal for biogeographic papers is the Journal of
   Biogeography. Most frequent keywords seem to indicate that biogeography
   fits well within both evolutionary biology and ecology, with molecular
   biology and phylogenetics being important factors that drive their
   current development.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive tribal-level classification for the world's subfamilies
   of Hesperiidae, the skipper butterflies, is proposed for the first time.
   Phylogenetic relationships between tribes and subfamilies are inferred
   using DNA sequence data from three gene regions (cytochrome oxidase
   subunit I-subunit II, elongation factor-1 alpha and wingless). Monophyly
   of the family is strongly supported, as are some of the traditionally
   recognized subfamilies, with the following relationships: (Coeliadinae +
   ({''}Pyrginae{''} + (Heteropterinae + (Trapezitinae + Hesperiinae)))).
   The subfamily Pyrginae of contemporary authors was recovered as a
   paraphyletic grade of taxa. The formerly recognized subfamily
   Pyrrhopyginae, although monophyletic, is downgraded to a tribe of the
   ``Pyrginae{''}. The former subfamily Megathyminae is an infra-tribal
   group of the Hesperiinae. The Australian endemic Euschemon rafflesia is
   a hesperiid, possibly related to ``Pyrginae{''} (Eudamini). Most of the
   traditionally recognized groups and subgroups of genera currently
   employed to partition the subfamilies of the Hesperiidae are not
   monophyletic. We recognize eight pyrgine and six hesperiine tribes,
   including the new tribe Moncini. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2008.},

Abstract = {Palm leaves are an important resource for family households. The effect
   of harvest on leaf production, growth and fecundity of wild individual
   palm trees has been studied, but little is known about palm harvest in
   agro-forestry systems. In the Maya area of the Yucatan Peninsula,
   Mexico, leaves of the xa'an palm (Sabal yapa, and Sabal mexicana) have
   been used since pre-Hispanic days for thatching the roofs of traditional
   Maya houses. The Maya have introduced xa'an palms in homegardens and the
   care they provide them improves their growth. Maya householders agree on
   what they consider to be the best harvest intensity for xa'an,
   recommending one or two harvest events per year, and leaving one or two
   leaves in each event; however, there is not ecological information
   documenting whether the traditional harvesting practices are the most
   adequate to maintain or increase leaf production, and their effect on
   the growth and fecundity of the palm trees. In Maxcanu, Yucatan, we
   studied eight family homegardens with S. yapa and S. mexicana. The
   selected individuals from each homegarden (n = 252) underwent six
   harvest treatments for 2 years C: control, no harvest, Al: annual
   harvest, leaving three leaves on the palm, Am: annual harvest leaving
   two leaves, Ah: annual harvest leaving one leaf, SI: two harvests per
   year leaving three leaves, Sm: two harvests per year leaving two leaves.
   Treatments Ah and Sm simulated the traditional harvest method, and the
   remaining treatments simulated higher or lower harvest intensities and
   frequencies. Leaf production was higher in individual palms under higher
   harvest intensities and frequencies (Ah, Sl and Sm), but palm growth and
   leaf size were not affected by harvest. Number of inflorescences per
   palm differed between treatments and between homegardens during the
   first year only, but we could not find a clear pattern of variation.
   Production of new leaves was affected by initial palm size and initial
   leaf number. Removing mature leaves while leaving the young ones, as
   well as the intensity and frequency, with which traditional harvest is
   practiced, stimulate palms to compensate the defoliation effects by
   producing new leaves. This practice is based on empirical Maya knowledge
   that enables the manipulation of micro-environmental conditions and the
   development of sustainable harvesting Strategies for the xa'an palm in
   traditional agro-forestry systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The objective of this work is to contributed to the knowledge of the
   taxonomy of Mexican rudists, through the description of seven species of
   radiolitid rudists. A well-preserved fossil fauna permits detailed
   descriptions that may help toward reaching a better understanding of
   incomplete and ill-preserved material from other places. The specimens
   studied come from ``El Madrono{''}, located in the extreme northeastern
   section of the state of Queretaro, in east-central Mexico. The middle to
   upper Albian deposit pertains to the reefal Taninul facies of the El
   Abra Formation. The described species are rudist bivalves of the
   Radiolitidae family. From the seven species, three are already known:
   Eoradiolites davidsoni (Hill), Radiolites abraensis Coogan and
   Radiolites costata Scott. Four new species are proposed: Radiolites
   unisulcus, Radiolites scotti, Radiolites canistra and Radiolites
   maldonadoi. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The structural and ultrastructural features of gonads from endemic
   Mexican fish have received scarce attention. This study describes the
   histological and ultrastructural characteristics of oocyte from
   Chirostoma humboldtianum. The ovary is asynchronic, and as such, most
   phases of oocyte development are found in the same ovary. The complete
   process of oogenesis was divided in five stages: oogonium and
   folliculogenesis, primary growth, cortical alveoli and lipid inclusions,
   vitellogenesis, and maturation. The presence of big filaments, which
   appear at the end of primary growth, induces some common follicular
   adaptation. During primary growth, abundant ribosomes, the rough
   endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria are grouped in the cytoplasm. At
   the end of this stage, the Z1 layer of the chorion is developed, while
   microvilli start to be evident. In the cortical alveoli and lipid
   droplets phase, intense PAS positive vesicles, some of them containing
   nucleoid material, are observed in the peripheral cytoplasm and the
   lipid droplets take a more central position. In vitellogenesis, the
   proteic yolk accumulates in a centripetal way while the chorion is
   completely formed. During maturation, the germinal vesicle migrates to
   the animal pole, meiosis is restored, and there is nuclear breakdown.
   The oocyte increases its size and holds some oil droplets and a big
   fluid mass of yolk. On the outside, filaments completely surround the
   oocyte. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (3): 1371-1380. Epub 2008 September 30.},

Abstract = {Giardia duodenalis has been described as `anucleolated'. In this work we
   analysed the subcellular distribution of several nucleolar markers in
   Giardia nuclei using silver and immunostaining techniques for electron
   and confocal laser microscopy as well as expression of epitope-tagged
   proteins in transgenic trophozoites. We identified anteronuclear
   fibrogranular structures corresponding to nucleolar organising regions
   with recruited ribonucleoprotein complexes, rRNA and epitope-tagged
   fibrillarin and rRNA-pseudouridine synthase (CBF5). Recombinant
   fibrillarin and CBF5 were targeted to this subcompartment. This study
   demonstrates the presence of nucleoli in G. duodenalis and provides a
   model to analyse minimal requirements for nucleolar assembly and
   maintenance in eukaryotic cells. (C) 2008 Australian Society for

Title = {Phase resetting, phase locking, and bistability in the periodically
   driven saline oscillator:: Experiment and model},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {78},
Number = {3, 2},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The saline oscillator consists of an inner vessel containing salt water
   partially immersed in an outer vessel of fresh water, with a small
   orifice in the center of the bottom of the inner vessel. There is a
   cyclic alternation between salt water flowing downwards out of the inner
   vessel into the outer vessel through the orifice and fresh water flowing
   upwards into the inner vessel from the outer vessel through that same
   orifice. We develop a very stable (i.e., stationary) version of this
   saline oscillator. We first investigate the response of the oscillator
   to periodic forcing with a train of stimuli (period=T-p) of large
   amplitude. Each stimulus is the quick injection of a fixed volume of
   fresh water into the outer vessel followed immediately by withdrawal of
   that very same volume. For T-p sufficiently close to the intrinsic
   period of the oscillator (T-0), there is 1:1 synchronization or phase
   locking between the stimulus train and the oscillator. As Tp is
   decreased below T0, one finds the succession of phase-locking
   rhythms:1:1, 2:2, 2:1, 2:2, and 1:1. As Tp is increased beyond T-0, one
   encounters successively 1:1, 1:2, 2:4, 2:3, 2:4, and 1:2 phase-locking
   rhythms. We next investigate the phase-resetting response, in which
   injection of a single stimulus transiently changes the period of the
   oscillation. By systematically changing the phase of the cycle at which
   the stimulus is delivered (the old phase), we construct the
   new-phase-old-phase curve (the phase transition curve), from which we
   then develop a one-dimensional finite-difference equation ({''}map{''})
   that predicts the response to periodic stimulation. These predicted
   phase-locking rhythms are close to the experimental findings. In
   addition, iteration of the map predicts the existence of bistability
   between two different 1:1 rhythms, which was then searched for and found
   experimentally. Bistability between 1:1 and 2:2 rhythms is also
   encountered. Finally, with one exception, numerical modeling with a
   phenomenologically derived Rayleigh oscillator reproduces all of the
   experimental behavior.},

Abstract = {The crown architecture of three shade-tolerant tree species (two
   subcanopy and one mid-canopy) was analyzed in relation to the light
   regime of the forest understorey. The aim was to examine to which extent
   shade-tolerant species variate in their crown architecture. Tree
   saplings (265) between 50 and 300 cm height, and distributed from
   understorey to variously-sized canopy gaps, were measured for 13
   architectural traits in the lowland rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico.
   The analysis showed that the three species changed their architecture as
   light increased but in a different way. No species conformed to the
   typical wide-crown type expected for shade-tolerant species, and in
   contrast they presented some traits of light demanding species. The two
   sub-canopy species tended to adopt a crown form between a narrow- and
   wide-crown type, and the mid-canopy species showed more traits of a
   narrow-crown type. The horizontal crown area appeared as the more
   related trait to the light and sapling height. It is concluded that
   despite being shade-tolerant, the Studied species make use of better-lit
   environments in the forest understorey. The crown architecture of
   shade-tolerant species is not Lis rigid Lis originally conceived.},

Abstract = {The phenology of butterflies was analyzed in the Calakmul Region (CR) in
   the state of Campeche, Mexico, over the course of 3 years. Altogether,
   60,662 individuals were recorded, consisting of 359 species in 207
   genera, 18 subfamilies, 5 families, and 2 superfamilies. Greatest
   species diversity was recorded during Oct and Nov. Monthly fluctuation
   in diversity was defined by rare species. Hesperiidae (135 species) and
   Nymphalidae (111 species) were the most diverse families, and showed the
   greatest variation with respect to distribution of species richness
   throughout the year. Papilionidae showed the greatest species richness
   during the dry season. Pieridae, Nymphalidae, and Lycaenidae showed
   peaks of greatest species richness and relative abundance during the
   rainy season. Results were compared to faunal studies of the Sierra de
   Atoyac de Alvarez, in the state of Guerrero, and of the Sierra de
   Manantlan, in Jalisco and Colima. Important similarities were observed
   among phenological patterns in the butterfly fauna of the 3 regions,
   especially between CR and Manantlan. The phenology of species with
   greater relative abundance was analyzed in relation to wingspan as a
   parameter of adult size. The small and medium-sized groups, taken
   together, showed variations in species richness. An analysis of species
   seasonality was conducted with NMDS, ANOSIM and SIMPER, in the program
   PRIMER 4.0. Differences among the composition of butterfly communities
   with respect to the seasons were found.},

Abstract = {The aquatic birds of Mexico include both a rich fauna of residents and a
   significant proportion of migratory species that breed in Canada and the
   United States, yet their distribution and richness patterns remain
   poorly known. We developed a detailed database of occurrences, and
   estimated distributions using niche modeling interpolations for 134
   species associated with wetlands. Validations of the resulting maps
   indicated that the niche-modeling approach yields a useful picture of
   aquatic bird species distributions in the country. Richness patterns
   among aquatic birds differ from those for landbirds: species richness is
   concentrated in coastal areas, but endemism is focused in the
   Transvolcanic Belt and the Altiplano. Place prioritization exercises
   identified sets of areas that would maximize the protection of this
   diversity.},

Abstract = {Sierra Madre Sparrows (Xenospiza baileyi) are among the least known of
   all bird species in Mexico. Recent surveys have discovered previously
   unknown populations and the current known distribution of Sierra Madre
   Sparrows consists of two populations separated by >800 km. We used
   available distributional information to develop ecological niche models
   that (1) predict much of the distribution potential of the species, (2)
   establish that the broad disjunction separating the two populations has
   ecological correlates that appear to be important to the distributional
   of these sparrows, and (3) illustrate the extremely restricted
   ecological distribution of the species. We used two sets of climatic and
   topographic variables, with one including all 22 variables available and
   the second with only six variables that were positively related to
   quality of distributional models. Although indications of differences
   between the two sets of populations were found based on the full
   22-dimensional environmental dataset, such a highly dimensional analysis
   is vulnerable to over-fitting; models based on the reduced dataset
   indicated that the two populations occur in areas with similar
   ecological conditions. Our models also suggest that southern population
   of Sierra Madre Sparrows covers most of their potential range in that
   region. The potential range of the northern population, however, extends
   beyond known points of occurrence. To clarify the distribution of Sierra
   Madre Sparrows and evaluate their status and conservation opportunities,
   detailed searches for additional populations in areas identified by the
   model are needed.},

Abstract = {Cation, anion, and neutral states in Au-M dimer clusters have been
   calculated as a way to study in a small model, the Au-sites, and M-sites
   in a supported nanoparticle (NP). These charged states can be formed
   during a charge transfer process between certain atoms of the NP with
   the atoms of the support or simply with cationic or anionic defects.
   These results can be important to evaluate in a preliminary way, the
   relation between the activity of the Au-sites and M-sites because of its
   charge and the effectiveness of the adsorption of O-2, and the
   subsequent interaction between adsorbed O-2 and CO through a
   Langmuir-Rideal unimolecular mechanism. For the O-2 adsorption over Au
   active site, the Au-Ir, Au-Au, Au-Ag, Au-Pd, and Au-Cu dimers yielded
   negative binding energies in all the charge states considered (anion,
   cation, and neutral); when M active site was considered, Au-Cu and Au-Ag
   dimers also gave negative values of binding energies in all the charged
   states. Furthermore, there was observed that electron rich Au-sites are
   essential in the O-2 adsorption. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Direct studies of mammalian carnivores are challenging due to the
   animals' secretive nature and the high costs associated with their
   capture and handling. Use of noninvasive hair sampling to survey these
   reclusive species has great potential as an alternative, with wide
   applicability in ecology and conservation. Hair-trapping has been
   extensively used for focal studies of temperate mammals, but its use and
   applicability as a means to survey mammals in tropical environs has
   never been addressed. We evaluated the effectiveness. of 2 hair-trap
   types and 2 scents along an elevational gradient within El Cielo
   Biosphere Reserve (ECBR, Mexico) to detect presence of carnivores.
   Hair-traps that used roofing nails as a hair-collecting surface
   collected more hairs and detected a greater number of species than did
   hair-traps that used velcro, strips. Different scent treatments
   (commercial fragrance and catnip oil) did not differ for these same
   variables. Of successful nail hair-traps, 60\% collected >= 20 hairs
   (max. = 439), providing enough material for DNA analyses. Hair-trap
   surveys detected 74\% of the potential target mammal species at ECBR
   with only 19 days of field effort. Developing countries have limited
   budgets for biodiversity monitoring and hair-traps compare favorably
   with other methods with a high cost-benefit ratio. Hair-traps are
   inexpensive, portable, can be made with over-the-counter materials, and
   can be successfully used to collect data applicable to population and
   genetic studies of tropical carnivores.},

Abstract = {beta-Carboline alkaloids are natural products widely distributed in
   plants and also found in alcoholic beverages, well-cooked foods and
   tobacco smoke. Various authors have reported genotoxic activities of
   several carboline in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that have been
   attributed to their abilities to intercalate into DNA. But studies on
   the genotoxic and on the cytotoxic potencies in human cells in vitro are
   not found in the literature. In the present study the toxicities of one
   full aromatic beta-carboline alkaloid (harmine) and one
   dihydro-p-carboline alkaloid (harmaline) were evaluated by means of two
   in vitro human cell assays: the cytoclialasin-B blocked micronucleus
   (CBMN) assay and the viability/colony formation assay with four
   different human cultured non-transformed (CCD18Lu) and transformed
   (HeLa, C33A and SW480) cells. Neither alkaloid was able to induce
   micronuclei levels above that of control levels in a wide range of doses
   tested; although, harmine at the highest concentrations assayed induced
   apoptotic as well as necrotic cells. Harmine produced a good viability
   of all cell lines assayed (control and tumor) while harmaline
   significantly reduced the viability of transformed and non-transformed
   cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Harmine displayed a
   dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation against all human
   carcinoma cells, but the SW480 transformed cell line showed a higher
   sensitivity. These results suggested that harmine was identified as a
   useful inhibitor of tumor development. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {Pollination in Nicotiana alata stimulates synthesis and transfer
   to the stigmatic surface of NaStEP, a vacuolar Kunitz proteinase
   inhibitor homologue},

Abstract = {After landing on a wet stigma, pollen grains hydrate and germination
   generally occurs. However, there is no certainty of the pollen tube
   growth through the style to reach the ovary. The pistil is a gatekeeper
   that evolved in many species to recognize and reject the self-pollen,
   avoiding endogamy and encouraging cross-pollination. However,
   recognition is a complex process, and specific factors are needed. Here
   the isolation and characterization of a stigma-specific protein from N.
   alata, NaStEP (N. alata Stigma Expressed Protein), that is homologous to
   Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitors, are reported. Activity gel assays
   showed that NaStEP is not a functional serine proteinase inhibitor.
   Immunohistochemical and protein blot analyses revealed that NaStEP is
   detectable in stigmas of self-incompatible (SI) species N. alata, N.
   forgetiana, and N. bonariensis, but not in self-compatible (SC) species
   N. tabacum, N. plumbaginifolia, N. benthamiana, N. longiflora, and N.
   glauca. NaStEP contains the vacuolar targeting sequence NPIVL, and
   immunocytochemistry experiments showed vacuolar localization in
   unpollinated stigmas. After self-pollination or pollination with pollen
   from the SC species N. tabacum or N. plumbaginifolia, NaStEP was also
   found in the stigmatic exudate. The synthesis and presence in the
   stigmatic exudate of this protein was strongly induced in N. alata
   following incompatible pollination with N. tabacum pollen. The transfer
   of NaStEP to the stigmatic exudate was accompanied by perforation of the
   stigmatic cell wall, which appeared to release the vacuolar contents to

Abstract = {in the last decades, a wide collection of experimental evidence has been
   found in the study of supercooled glassformers on the existence of a
   crossover between two dynamical regimes at a temperature T-c. We discuss
   the validity of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann in both regions. The breakdown
   of the Stokes-Einstein relation below T-c is presented, indicating that
   the diffusion coefficient of a tracer becomes decoupled from the
   viscosity through an exponent xi, and the diffusion process is
   intensified. We verify that a temperature shift on the diffusion
   coefficient introduces the same effect as the Stokes-Einstein breakdown
   equation. We present the dependence of this exponent on the ratio
   between the radii of the tracer and the host liquid molecule. (C) 2008

Title = {Molecular and morphological evidence reveals three species within the
   California sister butterfly, Adelpha bredowii (Lepidoptera:
   Nymphalidae: Limenitidinae)},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},
Year = {2008},
Number = {1819},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {In recent decades the butterfly Adelpha bredowii (Lepidoptera:
   Nymphalidae), known in the USA as the California Sister, has been
   considered to be a polytypic array of taxa, composed of two, three or
   four subspecies. The most recent review of the genus (Willmott 2003a)
   recognized three: A. b. bredowii, A. b. eulalia (= guatemalensis) and A.
   b. californica. We used mitochondrial (COII) and nuclear (Tpi) DNA
   sequence data, coupled with a reevaluation of traditional morphological
   characters, to determine the phylogenetic relationships between members
   of the A. bredowii complex, and to elucidate their taxonomic status.
   Phylogenetic analysis of molecular data corroborated the monophyly of
   each of the three subspecies (sensu Willmott), with the following
   topology: (bredowii + (eulalia + californica)). Average levels of COII
   variation among these taxa were much greater than the average variation
   within each taxon (3.4\% vs. 0.2\%, respectively). There were no shared
   alleles among these taxa, even from localities where two lineages
   (bredowii and eulalia) were collected in exact sympatry and synchrony.
   The degree of genetic divergence, reciprocal monophyly, and absence of
   shared alleles between taxa, coupled with unique morphological and
   distributional attributes of each, strongly suggest that A. bredowii, A.
   eulalia and A. californica are all species-level taxa, as they are
   treated herein (rev. stat.). Adelpha bredowii is endemic to western,
   central and southern Mexico: the syntype female (herein designated
   Lectotype) most likely originated near Oaxaca City, Oaxaca. Adelpha
   eulalia occurs from Guatemala, through much of Mexico, to Arizona, New
   Mexico and Texas, United States (as permanent residents; further north
   as vagrants), and occurs in exact sympatry with A. bredowii at least in
   Oaxaca, Mexico, but potentially in much of western and southwestern
   Mexico. The syntype female of eulalia (herein designated Lectotype) most
   likely originated from south-central Mexico. Adelpha californica is
   allopatric with respect to the other two species, occurring in northern
   Baja California, much of California, far western Nevada, Oregon and
   Washington. Our results highlight the continuous need for systematic
   scrutiny of familiar taxa, and raise the prospect that the genus Adelpha
   may be comprised of many more hidden species.},

Title = {Panbiogeographical analysis of the genus Bomarea

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1250-1257},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim A panbiogeographical analysis of the genus Bomarea was undertaken in
   order to determine generalized tracks and biogeographical nodes, and to
   evaluate the current distribution of the genus based on the available
   tectonic information and the biogeographical regionalization of Latin
   America.
   Location The Neotropical region from northern Mexico to northern
   Argentina, and the Nearctic and Andean regions.
   Methods A total of 2205 records of 101 species were analysed,
   representing 95\% of the species assigned to Bomarea. Localities were
   represented on maps and their individual tracks were drawn. Based on
   their comparison, generalized tracks were detected and mapped. Nodes
   were identified in the areas where different generalized tracks were
   superimposed.
   Results Five generalized tracks were recovered. One is located in the
   Eastern Central America and Western Panamanian Isthmus provinces
   (Caribbean subregion, Neotropical region), which was supported by three
   species of Central American distribution. The four remaining generalized
   tracks were located in South America, in the North Andean Paramo, Cauca
   and Puna biogeographical provinces. These tracks were supported by
   species of Bomarea with an Andean distribution. Biogeographical nodes
   were established in the Central Andean region of Colombia, central
   Ecuador and central Peru.
   Main conclusions The nodes obtained for Bomarea support a hybrid origin
   for the Andean region, which presents diverse components from both
   northern and southern South America. Likewise, the track recovered
   between Colombia and Ecuador includes Andean and Neotropical areas,
   providing further support for this hypothesis. The nodes obtained are
   coherent with vicariant elements evident for Bomarea. Species of three
   clades proposed for Bomarea are distributed in specific generalized
   tracks.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large scale structures of plasma and
   magnetic field expelled from the Sun to the interplanetary medium and
   generally observed in white light coronagraphs. During their travel, in
   the interplanetary medium these structures named interplanetary coronal
   mass ejections (ICMEs), suffer acceleration or deceleration due to the
   interaction with the ambient solar wind. This process can be understood
   as a transference of momentum between the interplanetary CME (ICME) and
   the solar wind. This process seems to be fundamentally different for
   `slow' and `fast' ICMEs (compared with the ambient solar wind velocity).
   In this work, we approach the problem from the fluid dynamics point of
   view and consider the ICMEs - solar wind system as two interacting
   fluids under the action of viscous forces. We note that this interaction
   is a special case of interaction between low density plasmas. Using
   these viscous forces in the Newtons Second Law, we obtained an
   analytical solution for the ICME velocity as a function of time. By
   comparing our analytic results with empirical models found in recent
   literature, we suggested values for the viscosity and drag parameters in
   this system. In this first approximation we have neglected the magnetic
   field.},

Abstract = {Large crystal bulks, grown by the Czochralski technique from a melt
   prepared by mixing equal molar fractions of KBr, RbCl, RbBr, KI, RbI,
   and KCl salts, are characterized by X-ray diffractometry and atomic
   force microscopy. The bulk material consists of a highly textured
   aggregation of crystallites of two different face-centered-cubic-solid
   solutions with unit-cell sizes of 7.247 +/- 0.001 and 6.536 +/- 0.005
   angstrom, in molar fractions of 1/3 and 2/3, respectively. These
   solutions are discussed to be the binary KI(34.4\%):RbI(65.6\%) and the
   quaternary KBr(42.7\%):RbCl(33.2\%):RbBr(8.1\%)KCl(16.0\%) mixed phases,
   respectively. Most of the crystallites, no matter the phase they belong
   to, are spatially coherent to each other. Freshly cleaved \{100\}-faces
   show surface domains, surrounded by canyons, and surface steps. These
   domains are plenty of knolls (1.8 +/- 0.1 knolls/mu m(2)) with a
   corresponding average knoll-profile full-width-at-half-maximum-value of
   0.054 +/- 0.003 mu m, suggesting that the material is formed by a mass
   of individual nanometric grains. Micrometric particles, showing defined
   crystallographic habits, are immersed within the growths so that they
   keep in common with the growth matrix important crystallographic
   directions. The expected consequences of the observed texture on the
   physical properties of the material, as well as the structural origin of
   both the observed surface steps and the whitish visual appearance of the
   growths, are discussed.},

Abstract = {We analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequence variation across 69
   Amethyst-throated Hummingbirds (Lampornis amethystinus), comparing with
   samples of related taxa. Although this group shows discrete phenotypic
   variation in throat color among populations in Oaxaca and Guerrero
   (Mexico), the only phylogeographic structure observed was between
   phenotypically similar populations north and south of the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec. As such, it appears that throat color variation is of
   recent origin and likely based only on minor genetic differences. (C)

Abstract = {Biogeography needs a standard, coherent nomenclature. Currently, in
   biogeography, the same name is used for different areas of biological
   endemism, and one area of endemism is known by more than one name, which
   leads to conflict and confusion. The name `Mediterranean', for example,
   may mean different things to different people - all or part of the sea,
   or the land in and around it. This results in ambiguity concerning the
   meaning of names and, more importantly, may lead to conflicts between
   inferences based on different aspects of a given name. We propose the
   International Code of Area Nomenclature (ICAN), a naming system that can
   be used to classify newly coined or existing names based on a standard.
   When fully implemented, the ICAN will improve communication among
   biogeographers, systematists, ecologists and conservation biologists.},

Title = {Successional change and resilience of a very dry tropical deciduous

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {We analyzed successional patterns in a very dry tropical deciduous
   forest by using 15 plots differing in age after abandonment and
   contrasted them to secondary successions elsewhere in the tropics. We
   used multivariate ordination and nonlinear models to examine changes in
   composition and structure and to estimate forest recovery rates and
   resilience. A shrub phase characterized early succession (0-3 yr);
   afterwards, the tree Mimosa acantholoba became dominant. Below its
   canopy, sprouts and seed-regenerated individuals of mature forest
   species slowly accumulated. Canopy height, plant density, and crown
   cover stabilized in less than 15 yr, whereas species richness,
   diversity, and basal area continued to increase. The pioneer species
   group has very low diversity and the long-lived pioneer phase typical of
   humid forests is absent; species composition may therefore recover soon
   as suggested by convergence toward mature forest species composition.
   The time trend of plant density also differed from humid forests for it
   lacked its characteristic density decline, presumably because of
   differences in regeneration mechanisms between very dry and other less
   water-stressed forest types. As opposed to the prevailing hypothesis,
   resilience was not higher than in moister forests, and thus factors
   other than structure relative simplicity must be accounted for when
   assessing resilience.},

Abstract = {The present study describes the morphology and ultrastructural features
   of postnatal follicular development in the volcano mouse (Neotomodon
   alstoni alstoni), an endemic Mexican rodent. By the first week of age,
   germ cells were organized in clusters within the ovigerous cords, and
   only 51.8\% of them were associated with somatic cells. At the
   ultrastructural level, pairing chromosomes and cellular junctions
   between germ and pregranulosa cells, such as desmosomes, were observed.
   At this time, the zona pellucida could not be detected in the formed
   follicles. From 15 to 28 days postpartum, growing follicles were located
   at the medulla and inner cortex of the ovary, but most were atretic. The
   first preovulatory follicles were seen at 40 days. Likewise, corpora
   lutea were observed at this stage of development, which shows that the
   volcano mouse is a spontaneous ovulator. The follicular development of
   the volcano mouse shows strong similarities with that of the golden
   hamster, particularly during the first week. The morphological changes
   observed during postnatal follicular development of the volcano mouse
   follow the same general histological pattern as reported for other
   mammals, although the timing of these events is species-specific.},

Abstract = {Successful fertilization requires gametes to complete several stages,
   beginning with maturation and transport along the male and female
   reproductive tracts and ending with the interaction between the sperm
   and the egg. This last step involves sperm-egg adhesion and membrane
   fusion. ADAMs (disintegrin and metalloprotease domain proteins) are a
   family of membrane-anchored glycoproteins that are thought to play
   diverse roles in cell-cell adhesion through their interaction with
   integrins. This study analyzes the presence, location, processing, and
   possible role of ADAM15 in mouse sperm. The presence of ADAM15 in mouse
   spermatozoa was detected by Western blotting, which revealed that ADAMI
   5 is post-translationally processed, during epididymal sperm maturation
   and the acrosome reaction. The 35 kDa antigen present in the
   acrosome-reacted sperm is the last proteolytic product of the 110/75 kDa
   ADAM15 found in noncapacitated sperm. This 35 kDa protein contains the
   disintegrin domain. By indirect immunofluorescence, ADAM1 5 was
   identified in the acrosomal region and along the flagellum of mouse
   spermatozoa. In acrosome- reacted sperm, ADAM15 was lost from the
   acrosomal region, but remained diffusely distributed throughout the head
   and flagellum. Furthermore, the ADAM15 disintegrin domain (RPPTDDCDLPEF)
   partially inhibited fusion and almost completely inhibited sperm-oolemma
   adhesion. in conclusion, our data indicate that ADAM15 is present in the
   testis and in spermatozoa from the caput, corpus, and cauda epididymis,
   as well as in non-capacitated and ac rosome- reacted gametes. Results
   also indicate that ADAM15 is processed during epididymal maturation and
   acrosome reaction and that it may play a role during sperm-egg binding.},

Title = {Variation of functional traits in trees from a biogeographically complex
   Mexican cloud forest},

Abstract = {Several studies have proposed a group of morpho-functional traits as
   determinants of the ecological strategy of species. Among these, four
   morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a
   plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at
   maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the
   variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups
   among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a
   montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined
   using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering.
   Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods:
   cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations
   using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations
   between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being
   between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was
   also correlated in PICs. in both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other
   traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9\% of the
   between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species
   variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main
   groups. observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported
   for other floras, with the important exception of the independent
   behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable
   successful life history strategies among the studied species. The effect
   of phylogeny in trait covariation was unimportant, in fact, a mixture of
   clades was represented in several groups among the species they
   contained, suggesting among-lineage convergence. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {Richness and endemism of helminth parasites of freshwater fishes in

Abstract = {Distribution records of 152 adult helminth taxa parasites of freshwater
   fishes in Mexico were analysed to determine areas of high richness and
   endemism. Distribution maps were prepared for each taxon and overlaid
   onto a map of Mexico divided into 1 x 1 degree grid-cells. Richness was
   determined by counting recorded helminth species in each grid-cell. A
   corrected weighted endemism index was calculated for each grid-cell, and
   the relationship between richness and endemicity was analysed with an
   Olmstead-Tukey corner test of association. Five areas of high richness
   and endemism were identified: (1) Los Tuxtlas and the Papaloapan river
   basin, on the Gulf of Mexico; (2) the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin near the
   Gulf of Mexico coastal plain; (3) the Yucatan Peninsula; (4) the Sierra
   de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve in western Mexico; and (5) the Patzcuaro
   lake, in central Mexico. The distribution of richness and endemism of
   helminth parasites of freshwater fishes in Mexico is congruent with
   distributional patterns described for other freshwater taxa in Mexico.
   Patterns of richness and/or endemism in the studied areas can be
   explained by the ichthyological composition of their bodies of water.
   The present study establishes an objective way of analysing the
   relationship between richness and endemicity, and suggests that
   helminths can make valuable contributions to regionalization of
   geographical areas and for identification of rich and biologically
   complex areas with potential for conservation of aquatic systems. (C)

Abstract = {A distinctive new species of rattlesnake is described from the western
   versant of the Sierra Madre del Sur of Guerrero, Mexico. This
   long-tailed rattlesnake cannot be confused with any other species of
   rattlesnake and is most similar to Crotalus stejnegeri and C. lannomi.
   The Guerrero species possesses a strikingly distinct color pattern and
   differs from all other rattlesnakes in aspects of lepidosis. Mexico
   continues to be the origin of newly discovered species that provide
   important insights into the evolution or ecology of particular groups. A
   few examples from recent decades include Exiliboa placata, a monotypic,
   relictual dwarf boa (Bogert, 1968), Rhadinophanes monticola, a
   monotypic, highland colubrid (Myers and Campbell, 1981), and
   Pseudoeurycea aquatica, the only aquatic bolitoglossine salamander (Wake

   2 930 and 3 250 m a.s.l. Calculated indexes were: species richness (S),
   Shannon's diversity index (W), Pielou's evenness index (J') and Simpson
   dominance (lambda). An ANOVA of two way test was used to evaluate the
   effect of attitude and sampling date on the total density of the
   springtails. The total number of species was 24 (altitude I=17, altitude
   II=14, altitude III=13). The greatest density was at altitude III and
   the highest species richness at altitude 1, Americabrya arida and
   Willowsia mexicana were dominant. There is a positive significant effect
   of altitude on their density. The highest Sorensen similarity between
   communities was 59 \% ( altitudes II and III).},

Abstract = {Recent excavations of Temple R, dedicated to the Aztec god of wind and
   rain, Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, at the archaeological site of Tlatelolco,
   Mexico City, recovered the sacrificial remains of 37 subadults and 6
   adults. It is believed that this ceremonial complex was the site of an
   extraordinary ceremony carried out during the great drought and famine
   of AD 1454-57, a date consistent with the founding of this temple. The
   ages of 31 subadults and 1 adult were estimated by standard
   morphometrics analysis of the skeletal remains. Most of the subadults
   (66\%) were children up to 3 years old. Through the extraction of
   ancient DNA from these remains, it was possible to use molecular
   techniques to determine the sex of the skeletal remains where in many
   cases (subadults and fragmentary remains) morphometrics analyses failed.
   Most, if not all, of these sacrificial victims were males. This
   remarkable gender bias is consistent with the notion that the victims
   chosen for sacrifice were a living impersonation of the god to whom they
   were offered.},

Abstract = {The effects of feeding three natural frozen diets, grass shrimp
   (Palaemonetes sp.), crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and fish (Sardina
   pilchardus) and two semi-humid artificial diets (based on fish powder)
   to mature cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, were analysed. Growth and
   feeding rates (GR and FR, \% BW day(-1)), food conversions (FC, \%), and
   total protein and lipid composition of the diets were determined.
   Digestive gland to body weight ratio and absorption efficiency were
   calculated for each diet. Cuttlefish fed shrimp and crayfish grew larger
   (1.5 and 1.1\% BW day(-1), respectively) compared to the other diets.
   Shrimp promoted the highest F, followed by crayfish, and sardine. The
   highest FR was obtained for cuttlefish fed crayfish (8.4\% BW day(-1)).
   Although both artificial diets were accepted, none produced growth. A
   positive correlation (r = 0.96) between cuttlefish ingestion rate and
   digestive gland weight was obtained. Some cannibalism occurred among
   cuttlefish fed the artificial diets during the last week of the
   experiment. According to the results obtained, P. clarkii could be used
   as an alternative prey to shrimp for rearing adult mature (> 50 g) S.

Abstract = {The species composition, altitudinal distribution and adult food
   resources of the butterfly fauna of Malinalco, Mexico State, were
   studied. Over the course of one year, systematic collections were
   carried out at 12 localities between 1000 and 2 000 in of elevation,
   resulting in 1333 specimens, which represent 2 superfamilies, 6
   families, 21 subfamilies, 147 genera and 213 species, of which 157 are
   new records (63 new regional records, 94 new state records). The most
   diverse family was Hesperiidae (74 species), followed by Nymphalidae (55
   species), Lycaenidae (30 species), Pieridae (26 species), Papilionidae
   (16 species) and Riodinidae (12 species). The best-represented genera in
   terms of species richness were Urbanus, Strymon, Emesis and Chlosyne.
   Based on a fitted species accumulation curve, following Clench's model,
   81\% of the number of species expected to occur were actually collected.
   The list of species generated from this fieldwork was increased with
   additional data from the Mariposa database at the Museo de Zoologia
   Alfonso L. Herrera, Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM, for a total of 240
   species recorded from the Municipality. The greatest diversity of
   species (102) was found in May, coinciding with the beginning of the
   annual rainy season, followed by 62 species in July, and 42 species in
   August. Thirty one percent of the species were only found below 1400 m.
   Based on feeding preferences and available food resources of adults,
   three feeding guilds were determined: nectar.-feeding (54\%),
   mud-puddling (2\%) and yeast-feeding (3\%).},

Abstract = {Commercial product irradiation using ionizing radiation has provided a
   method to safely treat products in a variety of ways. Temperature is a
   very important factor when determining the absorbed dose of the product.
   However, most irradiation complexes apply dosimetric knowledge and
   calculations in a temperature range above water-freeze temperature to
   products that Could be at a much lower temperature. This could lead to
   systematic errors in the irradiation procedures and to health issues.
   In this paper, we study the response of the Fricke dosimeter as a
   function of the irradiation temperature. The temperatures studied were:
   77 K (liquid nitrogen), 198 K (dry ice as powder), 263 K, 298 K (room
   temperature), 306 K and 328 K.
   The results obtained show that the change in valence of iron (11) as a
   function of the dose was linear for frozen solutions. There is a change
   of the slope in the doses-response curve that shows the effect of the
   irradiation temperature. This suggests that a temperature correction
   should be considered for low-temperature irradiation. This led to the
   conclusion that the Fricke dosimeter can be used as a dosimeter for
   low-temperature, and up to 600 Gy.
   An attempt has been made to theoretically model the chemical response of
   the Fricke dosimeter and results agreed with the experimental values
   fairly well.},

   fragmentation, and degree of anthropogenic impact. We also provide some
   nouvelle data on the systematics of some select taxa, their geographical
   ranges, microhabitats, activity, and other relevant ecological and
   natural history features. Finally, we comment on the present
   conservation status of the herpetofauna in the region. Previous
   literature and collection records indicate a higher number of species
   occurring in this area, which suggests that some declines have occurred,
   especially of amphibians, in last decades.},

Abstract = {The phylogenetic placement of the limbless lizard genus Anelytropsis
   within Squamata was investigated using partial mitochondrial 16S rRNA
   sequences (422 bp). A total of 30 species, representing most of the
   major currently recognized squamate clades, was included in the
   analysis. As in previous morphological studies, Anelytropsis was
   strongly supported in Bayesian (mixture and unpartitioned models) and
   maximum-likelihood analyses as the sister taxon of Dibamus. Thus, a
   monophyletic Dibamidae composed of these two genera is supported by
   molecular data for the first time. Furthermore, several relationships in
   the inferred tree, although weakly supported, were congruent with those
   found in previous molecular phylogenetic analyses. Among these, Gekkota
   and the Dibamidae were recovered as relatively basal groups within
   Squamata. A nonmonophyletic Scleroglossa and Lacertiformes (=
   Amphisbaenia + Lacertidae + Teiidae + Gymnophthalmidae) also were
   recovered. Although only weakly supported, a major difference from other
   recent molecular studies is the basal position of Serpentes.},

Title = {Uniqueness of the Fock representation of the Gowdy

Abstract = {After a suitable gauge fixing, the local gravitational degrees of
   freedom of the Gowdy S-1 x S-2 and S-3 cosmologies are encoded in an
   axisymmetric field on the sphere S-2. Recently, it has been shown that a
   standard field parametrization of these reduced models admits no Fock
   quantization with a unitary dynamics. This lack of unitarity is
   surpassed by a convenient redefinition of the field and the choice of an
   adequate complex structure. The result is a Fock quantization where both
   the dynamics and the SO( 3)- symmetries of the field equations are
   unitarily implemented. The present work proves that this Fock
   representation is in fact unique inasmuch as, up to equivalence, there
   exists no other possible choice of SO( 3)- invariant complex structure
   leading to a unitary implementation of the time evolution.},

Abstract = {Identifying appropriate larval husbandry is a key to improve larval
   quality and shorten duration of larval stages, and culture costs of
   ornamental cleaner shrimps Lysmata amboinensis. Several feeding and
   zootechnical experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions to
   test the effect of food during the first day posthatch, the effect of
   feeding with microalgae on larval digestion after 24 h posthatch, the
   effect of enriched rotifers upon survival and the combined effect of
   stocking density and food concentration on growth and survival of young
   larvae. For the first time, oxygen consumption values, trypsin-like
   activity and metabolite content (protein and triacylglycerols) were
   determined for L. amboinensis early stage larvae. When starved during
   the first day of life, L. amboinensis larvae had the same oxygen
   consumption as fed larvae, indicating that food ingestion is not crucial
   during that period. Nevertheless, energy reserves such as TAG were
   significantly lower in 24 h starved larvae when compared with fed larvae
   indicating facultative primary lecitotrophy. Trypsin-like activity of
   digestive enzymes (U mg prot(-1)) was low when compared with other
   decapod larvae. Larvae fed with Tetraselmis chuii showed a significant
   increase in enzyme activity after 24 h. Present results showed that
   enriched rotifers result in higher larval survival during the first days
   of life when compared with larvae fed with non-enriched rotifers and
   that survival is not dependent on the relation between larval density
   and food concentration. In addition, stocking densities of 10 larvae
   ml(-1) showed higher survival compared to that obtained at the stocking
   density of 20 larvae ml(-1). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigated whether administration of MOD in rats during the
   lights-on period into wake-promoting areas, such as anterior
   hypothalamus (AH) or into the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg)
   would enhance waking. Results showed that microinjections of 1 mu L of
   MOD (10, 20, or 30 mu g) into both brain areas increased the total time
   of alertness and decreased sleep. Additionally, MOD-treated rats showed
   an enhancement in alpha power spectra but delta power spectra was
   diminished. Finally, c-Fos expression was found increased into either AH
   or the PPTg. Collectively, these results suggest that MOD induces waking
   via the activity of two wake-related brain areas such as AH and the
   PPTg. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Genetic variation in the common bush-tanager Chlorospingus ophthalmicus
   complex in Mesoamerica was studied. An 800-bp mitochondrial DNA
   fragment, including a portion of COII, full tRNA-Lys, ATP8, and partial
   ATP6, was sequenced and analyzed for 96 individuals of the species and
   related taxa, resulting in a detailed framework of genetic
   differentiation in the northern half of the distribution of the complex.
   Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood,
   and Bayesian optimality criteria found deep divergence between South
   American and Mesoamerican isolates, and seven differentiated populations
   corresponding to clear geographic breaks across the highlands of
   Mesoamerica. These distinct populations coincide with geographic
   structure found in previous analyses of morphological and molecular data
   for Chlorospingus ophthalmicus, as well as in previous phylogeographic
   studies of other taxa in the region. Species status for these
   populations is discussed under the evolutionary and biological species

Abstract = {We study the problem of the adjustment of an initial condition to an
   exact supersonic soliton solution of the Toda latice equation. Also, we
   study the problem of soliton propagation in the Toda lattice with slowly
   varying mass impurities. In both cases we obtain the full numerical
   solution of the soliton evolution and we develop a modulation theory
   based on the averaged Lagrangian of the discrete Toda equation. Unlike
   previous problems with coherent subsonic solutions we need to modify the
   averaged Lagrangian to obtain the coupling between the supersonic
   soliton and the subsonic linear radiation. We show how this modified
   modulation theory explains qualitatively in simple terms the evolution
   of a supersonic soliton in the presence of impurities. The quantitative
   agreement between the modulation solution and the numerical result is
   good.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to describe some theoretical aspects
   related to the migration, trafficking and smuggling of people,
   particularly women. The study intends to explain the connections and
   disconnections among these social phenomena, Trafficking as well as
   smuggling forms a part of migratory processes, which may occur with or
   without the immigrant's consent. When it occurs without a person's
   consent or through coercion it is called immigrant trafficking; on the
   other hand, when the movement occurs with the complete consent of an
   individual in order to enter a country illegally, it is called
   smuggling. The main purpose behind both of these activities is the same:
   the commerce of sex workers, the exploitation of people who are forced
   to perform work under conditions of slavery, among other activities, a
   situation which, to a certain point is the same in the case of the
   migration phenomenon when it occurs with or without a person's consent.},

Title = {Nurse rocks are more important than nurse plants in determining the

Abstract = {While it is widely acknowledged that nurse-plants facilitate the
   establishment of seedlings in drylands, there are several anecdotal
   reports on associations between cacti and rocks. We assessed the
   preference for rocks or shrubs from the spatial distribution of eight
   cactus species (Mammillaria spp.). We experimentally assessed if
   distribution results from facilitation evaluating the survival of
   Mammillaria pectinifera seedlings growing next to rocks or under nylon
   sunblockers that simulated shrub shading. We found that more than half
   of the species avoided shrubs, while 50\% of them were positively
   associated with rocks. Longevity and growth were highest for seedlings
   placed next to stones, so it may be concluded that the observed
   association is due to differential survival and not to other processes
   such as non-random seed dispersal. It is broadly accepted that the
   association between cacti and shrubs is mainly due to shading, however
   it may also represent a cost for the seedling in terms of
   photosynthetically active radiation. Rocks may provide a fresh and moist
   environment without reducing sunlight. Our results are relevant for
   conservation and reintroduction programs. It is important to continue
   the research on stress amelioration in drylands and to consider other
   kinds of nurse objects besides plant canopies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {MFe2O4 (M = Ni and Zn) nanoparticles were prepared by the hydrothermal
   method. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray and electron
   diffraction, Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy and Mossbauer
   spectroscopy. The transmission images show homogeneous shape and
   particle size ranging from 10 to 40 nm, depending on the nature of the M
   cation. Mossbauer spectroscopy yields to a ratio Of Occupancy between
   the A and B sites of 0.7 in the case of NiFe2O4 oxide. DC magnetization
   (2-300 K) measurements reveal a superparamagnetic behavior for the
   ZnFe2O4 sample with a blocking temperature of 20 K. By contrast, in the
   case of the NiFe2O4 ferrite the blocking temperature appears to be above
   300 K and at lower temperature, it shows a ferrimagnetic behaviour
   arising from the superexchange interactions that take place in this
   inverse spinel. Mossbauer spectroscopy results confirm the bulk magnetic
   measurements.},

Abstract = {Volcanic soils of several coffee-producing regions of Soconusco,
   Chiapas, Mexico, classified as Andisols, have peculiar physical and
   chemical characteristics and a udic moisture regime. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the function of phosphorus and
   phosphorus-related problems in the cultivation of coffee (Coffea
   arabica). Physical and chemical properties of the volcanic ash soils
   under a representative coffee plantation were determined. Two sources of
   phosphate fertilizers (triple superphosphate, ST; rock phosphate, RF)
   were compared. Phosphorus content in soil and plant was assessed, as
   well as its effect in four seasons of the year over five years. Besides,
   the residual effect of the phosphate sources and the effect of organic
   fertilizer on phosphorus contents of soil and plant was compared. The
   commercial formula (18-12-06) and two controls (18-00-12 and 00-00-00)
   were used. The study was conducted in the Municipality of Union Juarez,
   Chiapas, Mexico. An analysis of variance was performed with the data,
   and means were compared with the Tukey test. A high,level of P fixation
   in the soil was found. The highest concentrations of P in the soil and
   coffee plant were obtained with 18-20-12 RF and 18-20-12 ST. The highest
   concentrations of P were observed in June and September. There was
   better P residuality in the soil with RF than with ST, while with
   organic fertilizer there was no satisfactory response.},

Abstract = {The study of biogeographical patterns of the Neotropical humid montane
   forest avifauna has been prevented due to the lack of phylogenetic
   hypotheses for most taxa, and to the paucity of detailed studies about
   the geographical distribution for most of the species. Distributional
   patterns of this avifauna were explored by integrating predictive
   distributional models and Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE).
   Distributional maps were generated using the Genetic Algorithms for Rule
   Set Prediction for 442 species; this information was transformed into a
   data matrix for analysis with PAE. Hierarchical information
   corresponding to the genus level was incorporated to help resolve the
   relationships between areas. A strict consensus cladogram showed a clear
   separation between the Mesoamerican and South American avifaunas. Within
   the Mesoamerican clade, three geographically structured groups were
   obtained, whereas the South American clade showed a polytomy of three
   groups, with two of them, the South Andean Yungas and the Tepuis,
   located outside the main clade. The third group is a well resolved
   clade, including areas from eastern Panama and northern Venezuela to
   central Bolivia. Area relationships suggest a mixed history of dispersal
   and vicariant events, with the latter being the most important for
   explaining the biogeographical patterns found. (C) 2008 The Linnean

Title = {Demographic mechanisms in the coexistence of two closely related

Abstract = {The demographic variability and life history differentiation of two
   closely related shrubs (Atriplex canescens and A. acanthocarpa) were
   investigated in the Chihuahuan Desert, and the results were interpreted
   in the context of theories of coexistence in fluctuating environments.
   Demographic information was recorded during three annual intervals and
   analyzed employing matrix projection models. A. canescens had lower
   lambda (finite rate of population increase), higher longevity and
   generation time and slower convergence to a stable population structure
   than A. acanthocarpa. In favorable years for recruitment (those when,
   for both species, lambda > 1), the lambda of A. acanthocarpa was higher
   than that of A. canescens; in unfavorable years (when lambda < 1), the
   reverse was true. Regardless of conditions (year), A. acanthocarpa had a
   type 2 survivorship curve (constant rate of mortality with age), while
   A. canescens had a type 3 survivorship curve (declining mortality with
   age). Elasticity analyses highlighted the larger influence that
   fecundity and growth would have in modifying the lambda of A.
   acanthocarpa in comparison to that of A. canescens. In contrast,
   survival would have a larger influence on the lambda of A. canescens.
   Atriplex acanthocarpa behaved as an opportunistic species that
   benefitted from sporadic favorable conditions and declined rapidly when
   conditions deteriorated. In contrast, A. canescens behaved as a tolerant
   species able to withstand years when conditions were poor, but which
   could not gain any advantage over A. acanthocarpa when conditions
   improved. By each having a relative advantage over the other on opposite
   ends of the contrasting climatic conditions experienced in the
   Chihuahuan Desert, they are able to coexist. Their contrasting life
   histories agreed with the theoretical predictions for the operation of
   the two mechanisms of species coexistence in fluctuating environments:
   the storage effect and the relative non-linearity of competition. Based
   on these results, we conclude by speculating on the nature of succession
   in arid communities.},

Abstract = {The soils of montane cloud forests (MCF) are still insufficiently
   studied. A number of researchers report Podzols to be the main soil
   group for MCF ecosystems; however, a great deal of contradictory data
   exists. We studied an altitudinal sequence of soils formed on ferrous
   chlorite shale under natural MCF vegetation in Sierra Juarez, Southern
   Mexico, from 1500 to 2500 in asl. The soils of the upper part of the
   toposequence were Folic Stagnic Podzols, with inclusions of Folic
   Stagnosols in local depressions, while the soils of the lower part of
   the toposequence were Folic Cambisols (Humic, Hyperdystric). All the
   soils in the toposequence were extremely acid, and had thick organic
   surface horizon. Mineral horizons of all soils were poor both in
   exchangeable and total reserves of bases; the bases were concentrated
   mainly in organic topsoil. With decreasing altitude both the thickness
   of albic horizons, the depth of the maximum acid oxalate-ex tractable Fe
   and Al concentrations, and the difference in clay content between the
   eluvial and illuvial horizons decreased. In the upper part of the
   toposequence the composition of soil clays was similar to that of parent
   material (chlorite and mica), with some mixed-layered 2:1 minerals.
   However, gibbsite and kaolinite were also present in the soils of the
   other site within the same upper MCF belt. The phenomenon was ascribed
   to parent material heterogenity. In the medium and lower parts of the
   toposequence gibbsite and kaolinite were the dominant minerals. We
   consider that the main pedogenic, processes in the study area are raw
   humus accumulation, weathering in situ, podzolization, and iron
   reduction due to water stagnation in mineral topsoil. The intensity of
   weathering decreases, while the extent of water stagnation increases
   with altitude. To a great extent the genesis and altitudinal
   distribution of the soils in the MCF depends on parent material. (C)

Abstract = {A cladistic analysis of 22 species of Synalpheus, represented primarily
   by species of the Paulsoni species group from the American Pacific and
   selected species from the Gambarelloides, Neomeris, Brevicarpus, and
   Biunguiculatus species groups was undertaken, based on 51 morphological
   characters. The Paulsoni species group proved to be paraphyletic,
   because species of the Neomeris, Brevicarpus, and Biunguiculatus species
   groups nested within it. It is proposed herein that in order to achieve
   a more natural classification, only two groups should be maintained
   within Synalpheus: Gambarelloides and Paulsoni, the latter in its
   broadest sense, treating the remaining species groups as synonyms.},

   of C. doubledayi as a full species (not a subspecies of C. latirostris,

Abstract = {Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a lung inflammatory disease caused
   by the inhalation of a variety of antigens. Previous studies support the
   role of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class It genes in the
   susceptibility to develop HP. However, the putative role of other MHC
   loci has not been elucidated. Transporters associated with antigen
   processing (TAP) genes are located within the MHC class 11 region and
   play an important role transporting peptides across the endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane for MHC class I molecules assembly. The distribution
   of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TAP1 genes was analyzed in
   73 hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) patients and 58 normal subjects. We
   found a significant association of the allele Gly-637 (GGC) (p =
   0.00004, OR = 27.30, CI = 3.87-548.04) and the genotypes Asp-637/Gly-637
   (p = 0.01, OR = 16.0, CI = 2.19-631.21), Pro-661/Pro-661 (p = 0.006, OR
   = 11.30, CI = 2.28-75.77) with HP. A significant decrease in the
   frequency of the allele Pro-661 (CCA) (p = 0.008, OR = 0.06, CI =
   0-0.45), the genotype Asp-637/Asp-637 (p = 0.01, OR = 0.17, 95\% CI =
   0.05-0.58) and the haplotype {[}Val-333 (GTC), Val-458 (GTG), Gly-637
   (GGC), Pro-661 (CCA)] was detected in HP patients compared with controls
   (p = 0.002, OR = 0.07, CI = 0.0-0.57). These findings suggest that TAPI
   gene polymorphisms are related to HP risk, and highlight the importance
   of the MHC in the development of this disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The action of an electric discharge on reduced gas mixtures such as
   H(2)O, CH(4) and NH(3) (or N(2)) results in the production of several
   biologically important organic compounds including amino acids. However,
   it is now generally held that the early Earth's atmosphere was likely
   not reducing, but was dominated by N(2) and CO(2). The synthesis of
   organic compounds by the action of electric discharges on neutral gas
   mixtures has been shown to be much less efficient. We show here that
   contrary to previous reports, significant amounts of amino acids are
   produced from neutral gas mixtures. The low yields previously reported
   appear to be the outcome of oxidation of the organic compounds during
   hydrolytic workup by nitrite and nitrate produced in the reactions. The
   yield of amino acids is greatly increased when oxidation inhibitors,
   such as ferrous iron, are added prior to hydrolysis. Organic synthesis
   from neutral atmospheres may have depended on the oceanic availability
   of oxidation inhibitors as well as on the nature of the primitive
   atmosphere itself. The results reported here suggest that endogenous
   synthesis from neutral atmospheres may be more important than previously
   thought.},

Abstract = {The Buarremon brush-finches represent a complex suite of populations
   distributed in the montane New World Tropics from Mexico south to South

   of this genus into three species, based on plumage variation, although
   plumage patterns are well known to exhibit homoplasy. We present a first
   detailed phylogeographic and phylogenetic study, focused on Mesoamerican
   populations, and signal the existence of strong differentiation among
   populations with a clear geographic structure. We find well
   differentiated clades for (1) the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre
   del Sur in Oaxaca, (2) western Mexican populations, including the B.
   brunneinucha populations in the Sierra Madre del Sur and B. virenticeps,
   (3) Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra de los Tuxtlas, (4) northern
   Central America, (5) southern Central America, (6) middle Central
   America, and (7) South America. We demonstrate a lack of concordance
   with plumage patterns, and argue for several additional species to be
   recognized in the complex. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The recent discovery of a fifth planet bound to 55 Cancri (Fischer et.
   al 2007) motivated us to investigate if this exo-planetary system fits
   some form of the Titius-Bode (TB) law. We found that a simple
   exponential TB relation reproduces very well the five observed major
   semi-axis, provided we assign the orbital n = 6 to the largest a. This
   way of counting leaves empty the position n = 5, a situation curiously
   reminiscent of TB law in our planetary system, before the discovery of
   Ceres. The application of an exponential TB relation to 55 Cancri allows
   us to predict the existence of a planet at a approximate to 2.0 AU with
   a period of P 1130 days located within the large gap between a = 0.781
   AU (P = 260 days) and a = 5.77 AU (P = 5218 days). With less certainty,
   we also predict a seventh planet at a 15 AU, with P 62 years.},

Title = {MMP1 and MMP7 as potential peripheral blood biomarkers in idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {623-633},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background
   Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic
   lung disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The
   objective of this study was to determine whether there is a peripheral
   blood protein signature in IPF and whether components of this signature
   may serve as biomarkers for disease presence and progression.
   Methods and Findings
   We analyzed the concentrations of 49 proteins in the plasma of 74
   patients with IPF and in the plasma of 53 control individuals. We
   identified a combinatorial signature of five proteins MMP7, MMP1, MMP8,
   IGFBP1, and TNFRSF1A-that was sufficient to distinguish patients from
   controls with a sensitivity of 98.6\% (95\% confidence interval {[} CI]
   92.7\%-100\%) and specificity of 98.1\% (95\% CI 89.9\%-100\%).
   Increases in MMP1 and MMP7 were also observed in lung tissue and
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from IPF patients. MMP7 and MMP1
   plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis and distinguished IPF
   compared to subacute/chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease
   that may mimic IPF, with a sensitivity of 96.3\% (95\% CI 81.0\%-100\%)
   and specificity of 87.2\% (95\% CI 72.6\%-95.7\%). We verified our
   results in an independent validation cohort composed of patients with
   IPF, familial pulmonary fibrosis, subclinical interstitial lung disease
   (ILD), as well as with control individuals. MMP7 and MMP1 concentrations
   were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to controls in this
   cohort. Furthermore, MMP7 concentrations were elevated in patients with
   subclinical ILD and negatively correlated with percent predicted forced
   vital capacity (FVC\%) and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing
   capacity (DLCO\%).
   Conclusions
   Our experiments provide the first evidence for a peripheral blood
   protein signature in IPF to our knowledge. The two main components of
   this signature, MMP7 and MMP1, are overexpressed in the lung
   microenvironment and distinguish IPF from other chronic lung diseases.
   Additionally, increased MMP7 concentration may be indicative of
   asymptomatic ILD and reflect disease progression.},

Abstract = {The present study was designed to test the effects of type of binder on
   growth, nutritional physiology, total apparent digestibility, and some
   elements of the energetic balance of early O. maya juveniles. Two
   experiments were performed. One was aimed at evaluating the effect of
   type of binder on growth, nutritional physiology, and energetic balance
   and the other at knowing the effect of the binder on total apparent
   digestibility of O. maya. Binder type affected growth and survival of
   early O. maya juveniles. Octopuses fed alginate-bound crab meat lost
   weight and died, revealing that this type of binder limits nutrient
   absorption from the diet. In contrast, when gelatin was used as binder,
   energetic balance was similar to that obtained in animals fed natural
   crab, indicating that octopuses can digest gelatin. Apparently, gelatin
   promotes absorption of nutrients similar to that observed when octopuses
   were fed pieces of fresh crab. Salivary glands produce enzymes that are
   used to predigest the food. Results of the present study indicate that
   octopuses require higher enzyme activity to digest fresh crab than when
   animals are fed gelatin-bound crab paste, and that intracellular
   digestion in the digestive gland is similar in animals fed either type
   of diet. The present study reports, for the first time, differences
   among binders used for cephalopods' diet. Although no compounded feed
   formulations are available for cephalopods, it is a necessary step in
   the search for an adequate compounded feed for this novel species in
   aquaculture. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sedative and anxiolytic efficacy of Tilia americana var.
   mexicana inflorescences used traditionally by communities of

Year = {2008},
Volume = {116},

Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Aim of the study: Increasing demand of herbal products acquired in
   stores and markets, as well as medicinal plants collected for personal
   consume are a known modem tendency. In this study, the ethnomedicinal
   use of Tilia americana var. mexicana inflorescences as sedative and
   anxiolytic is reinforced by examinating inflorescences used by
   communities of the State of Michoacan, Mexico.
   Materials and methods: Experimental mouse models were used to evaluate
   the sodium pentobarbital (SP)-induced hypnosis potentiation, ambulatory
   activity, as well as sedative and anti-anxiety responses via oral
   administration of the aqueous extracts (10, 30 and/or 100 and 300
   mg/kg).
   Results: All samples tested produced a lengthening in the time of SP.
   Moreover, a significant attenuation in the anxiety-response in the
   plus-maze test and a diminution in both the head dipping response and
   ambulatory activity were observed resembling the response to diazepam
   (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.). TLC profiles of the samples showed similar pattern of
   flavonoids; HPLC-DAD exhibited peaks identified as derived of quercetin
   and kaempferol that may be responsible for the plant activity.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that inflorescences of stored
   specimens obtained from popular local markets show the same
   effectiveness with regard to sedative and anxiolytic-like actions than
   freshly collected samples. Since no toxicity was observed through this
   route of administration (up to 5000 mg/kg); therefore, it suggests that
   this plant is secure when used as tranquilizer in folk medicine. (C)

Abstract = {Gaps in recent studies of hognosed pit vipers in the genus Porthidium
   have left researchers with an incomplete estimate of the evolutionary
   history of this group. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the poorly
   known A hespere and additional Porthidium sequences obtained from
   GenBank were used to re-analyze the phylogenetic relationships of
   Porthidium. Using sequence data from the South American Porthidium, we
   also updated a previous molecular clock calibration based on the uplift
   of the Isthmus of Panama, and utilized this updated calibration to
   evaluate the phylogeography of arid-adapted Porthidium. Results from
   Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogenetic methods underscore the
   historical pattern of bi-directional dispersal into and out of South
   America within Porthidium, and place A hespere as the sister species to
   A dunni. The three species of arid-adapted Porthidium distributed across
   the Pacific coast of southern Mexico and northern Central America may
   have diverged in the late Miocene after the enlargement of the Rio
   Balsas drainage following the formation of the Mexican Transvolcanic
   Belt and the volcanic uplifting across the Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands.},

Abstract = {The root of the ``Elemuy{''} tree (Malmea depressa) is highly used in
   south east Mexico by the Mayan communities to treat type 2 diabetes. The
   long-term hypoglycemic effect (HbA1c) and the stimulation of insulin
   secretion resulting from the treatment with butanolic extract was
   studied using (n5-stz)-induced diabetic rats. We show that after 30 days
   of daily administration of 10 mg/kg of the butanolic extract, the
   glucose levels as well as the (HbA1c) levels were lower compared to the
   control group. This effect was also observed after 45 days of treatment,
   leading to the conclusion that the effects of chronic butanolic extract
   treatment are comparable to treatment with the standard drug Bieuglucon
   (R). In an acute experiment, we found that a single administration of
   the extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg stimulates insulin release, which is
   similar to the result seen with Tolbutamide administration. The new
   compound, 3-(3-hydroxy-2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl) propane-1,2 diol, was
   isolated from the active fraction of the butanolic extract. The results
   presented here support the utility of the traditional use of the root
   and suggest that the active fraction of the plant extract could be
   developed as a phytomedicine. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {This study tested the effect of sustained swimming on growth, ingestion
   rate, and morphology of juvenile montezumae swordtails (Xiphophorus
   montezumae). Because montezurnae swordtails inhabit running freshwater
   systems, it was expected that moderate exercise would increase feeding
   and growth rates, promoting also the hydrodynamic form of the fish.
   Experimental groups were subjected to different levels of sustained
   exercise by being forced to swim against water currents at four
   different velocities (0, 4.1, 7.8, and 12.9 cm/s). The results showed
   that growth-rate decrease in fish forced to swim, while the increase in
   exercise did not modify the ingestion rate. Thus, it is likely that the
   extra energy expenditure associated with the swimming cost was not
   compensated by an increase in food ingestion. Sustained exercise
   increased the fineness ratio towards a more hydrodynamic form.
   Morphological traits linked with minimum drag, such as caudal peduncle
   depth and amplitude of the caudal fin were not modified. Our results
   suggest that water velocity has an important role determining the
   physiology and, to a lesser extent, the morphology of young montezumae
   swordtails.},

Abstract = {Type A response regulators are a family of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana
   involved primarily in cytokinin signal transduction. A member of this
   family was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from bean plants
   (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown under conditions of phosphate starvation. The
   complete cDNA sequence showed the presence of the DDK domain, which is
   the hallmark of the response regulator family. Expression of the P.
   vulgaris response regulator 1 (PvRR1) showed clear regulation based on
   phosphate availability because transcript levels increased during
   phosphate starvation and returned to basal levels after
   resupplementation with phosphorus. Nitrogen and potassium starvation
   also upregulated PvRR1, indicating that cross talk with other nutrient
   signaling pathways might occur. Addition of cytokinins to plants growing
   under phosphate-sufficient conditions stimulated PvRR1 transcript levels
   both in detached leaves and in roots. However, cytokinins strongly
   inhibited PvRR1 expression in phosphate-starved plants after 24 h of
   incubation. At the protein level, subcellular localization of PvRR1
   indicated that it is a nuclear protein and that phosphate starvation
   modified protein levels but not the localization.},

Title = {Harvesting grasshoppers Sphenarium purpurascens in Mexico for

Abstract = {Predominant crops (corn, bean and alfalfa) in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley
   are routinely attacked by the grasshopper Sphenarium purpurascens
   (Orthoptera: Pyrgomophidae). The traditional method for managing this
   pest in Mexico has been the application of organophosphorus insecticides
   such as malathion. Inhabitants from Central Mexico also capture the
   grasshoppers for sale as food. In this study, we compared the capture of
   grasshoppers for human consumption to the conventional application of
   insecticides as a pest management strategy. The number of oothecae (egg
   pod), eggs, eggs per ootheca and the reproductive rate (Ro) were
   estimated over 2 years of the study. Counts were made on the edge and
   inner part of nine alfalfa plots. Egg density was found to be
   significantly affected by control tactic, with control > manual harvest
   > insecticide application. Egg density at the edge of farming plots was
   14.9 times higher than within a plot. Ros ranged from 1.74 to 4.88 in
   the control, from 0.21 to 0.98 in the plots under manual harvest and
   from 0.38 to 0.77 in the plots under insecticide application. Similar
   results were found comparing oothecae densities. A mean of 39.5
   eggs/ootheca was found, which constitutes the highest recorded value for
   this species. This research shows that manual harvest reduces the
   density of S. purpurascens and suggests that implementation of this
   mechanical method of control may be substituted for chemical control.
   Mechanical control provides general advantages: (1) a second profitable
   product for the human community; (2) savings realized from reduced cost
   of insecticides; and (3) reduced risk of soil and water contamination by
   insecticides. We propose that the manual harvest of insects is a
   practical method of pest control, which could be extensively applied in
   other crop systems in the world. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Mexico, a rich country in terms of amphibian diversity, hosts about 375
   described species. Population declines have been documented for several
   species where it is evident that their habitat is being destroyed or
   modified. However, other species which inhabit pristine areas are
   declining as well. It has been suggested that the chytrid fungus
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B.d.) may be one of the causes of the
   enigmatic declines in Mexico. We surveyed a total of 45 localities, in
   12 states across Mexico, examining a total of 360 specimens representing
   14 genera and 30 species. We also examined 91 specimens of Ambystoma
   mexicanum from a captive population in Mexico City as well as one
   Pachymedusa dacnicolor obtained in a pet shop. We used a two-tiered
   technique to detect the pathogen. For wild-caught specimens, we utilized
   light microscopy to identify presence of B.d. sporangia in amphibian
   skin. Then, to verify the infection, we used a quantitative real-time
   PCR assay on collected skin sections which is specific for B.d. For
   captive animals, we used a nonlethal version of the real-time PCR
   technique. We found evidence of B.d. infection in 111 animals comprising
   14 species in 13 localities. A large percentage (84\%) of Ambystoma
   mexicanum from the colony were infected with B.d. The two most highly
   infected individuals were the endangered Ambystoma mexicanum, from a
   captive colony, and Pachymedusa dacnicolor, purchased at a pet shop.},

Abstract = {Plant cover loss due to changes in land use promotes a decrease in spore
   diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), viable mycelium and,
   therefore, in AMF colonization, this has an influence in community
   diversity and, as a consequence, in its recovery. To evaluate different
   AMF propagules, nine plots in a tropical dry forest with secondary
   vegetation were selected: 0, 1, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 25, and 27 years
   after abandonment in Nizanda, Oaxaca, Mexico. The secondary vegetation
   with different stages of development is a consequence of slash and burn
   agriculture, and posterior abandonment. Soil samples (six per plot) were
   collected and percentage of AMF field colonization, extrarradical
   mycelium, viable spore density, infectivity and most probable number
   (MPN) of AMF propagules were quantified through a bioassay. Means for
   field colonization ranged between 40 \% and 70 \%, mean of total
   mycelium length was 15.7 +/- 1.88 mg(-1) dry soil, with significant
   differences between plots; however, more than 40 \% of extracted
   mycelium was not viable, between 60 and 456 spores in 100 g of dry soil
   were recorded, but more than 64 \% showed some kind of damage.
   Infectivity values fluctuated between 20 \% and 50 \%, while MPN showed
   a mean value of 85.42 +/- 44.17 propagules (100 g dry soil). We conclude
   that secondary communities generated by elimination of vegetation with
   agricultural purposes in a dry forest in Nizanda do not show elimination
   of propagules, probably as a consequence of the low input agriculture
   practices in this area, which may encourage natural regeneration.},

Abstract = {The state of Queretaro, Mexico is at the confluence of three
   physiographic provinces: Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Mexican Plateau and
   Sierra Madre Oriental. A list of its mosses has been compiled from field
   work and specimens at MEXU. A total of 212 species were recorded for the
   state, including Schistidium agassizii new for the country. The Sierra
   Madre Oriental province is the richest in terms of number of species,
   with about 82\% of the total moss diversity. A parsimony analysis of
   endemism (PAE) roughly identified three distinct regions in the state:
   the conifer-cloud-temperate forests in the northeast (Sierra Madre
   Oriental), the more xeric parts in the center and southeast (Mexican
   Plateau and ecotone areas of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt), and the
   almost temperate areas in the south (Transmexican Volcanic Belt). Moss
   diversity and distribution in the state is associated with the
   environmental diversity and the complex geological history of the
   region, but human activities may have modified the distributional
   patterns.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the electrical and optical characterization of glow
   discharge pulsed plasma in N-2/H-2 gas mixtures at a pressures range
   between 0.5 and 4.0 Torr and discharge current between 0.2 and 0.6 A.
   Electron temperature and ion density measurements were performed
   employing a double Langmuir probe. They were found to increase rapidly
   as the H-2 percentage in the mixture was increased up to 20\%. This
   increase slows down as the H-2 percentage in the gas mixture was
   increased above 20\% at the same pressure. Emission spectroscopy was
   employed to observe emission from the pulsed plasma of a steady-state
   electric discharge. The discharge mainly emits within the range 280-500
   nm. The emission consists of N-2 (C-X) 316, 336, 358 nm narrow peaks and
   a broad band with a maximum at lambda(max) = 427 nm. Also lines of N-2,
   N-2(+) and NH excited states were observed. All lines and bands have
   their maximum intensity at the discharge current of 0.417 A. The
   intensities of the main bands and spectral lines are determined as
   functions of the total pressure and discharge current. Agreement with
   other theoretical and experimental groups was established.},

Abstract = {A total of 21 pupfish Cyprindon meeki was collected from the spring
   Abraham Gonzalez, Durango, Mexico. Seven helminth taxa were recovered:
   Salsuginus angularis, Posthodiplostomum minimum, Clinostomum
   complanatum, Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, Cyclustera cf. ralli,
   Atactorhynchus duranguensis and Spiroxys sp. Among them, B.
   acheilognathi and A. duranguensis were the most frequent and abundant
   species. The remaining species were rare and found at low mean
   abundance. The observed species richness, individual parasite abundance,
   and diversity were low at component community and infracommunity levels.
   These features are in accordance with those recorded for other
   freshwater fish species in the Nearctic part of Mexico. Host feeding
   habits, along with its role as intermediate host, are suggested as the
   main factors in determining the helminth community structure in this
   fish species.},

Title = {Developmental morphology of the neonatal alligator (Alligator

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY},

Volume = {269},
Number = {3},
Pages = {302-312},

Abstract = {American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) ovary development is
   incomplete at hatching. During the months following hatching, the
   cortical processes of oogenesis started in ovo continues and
   folliculogenesis is initiated. Additionally, the medullary region of the
   gonad undergoes dramatic restructuring. We describe alligator ovarian
   histology at hatching, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months of age in order to
   characterize the timing of morphological development and compare these
   findings to chicken ovary development. At hatching, the ovarian cortex
   presents a germinal epithelium containing oogonia and a few primary
   oocytes irregularly scattered between somatic epithelial cells. The
   hatchling medulla shows fragmentation indicative of the formation of
   lacunae. By 1 week of age, oocytes form growing nests and show increased
   interactions with somatic cells, indicative of the initiation of
   folliculogenesis. Medullary lacunae increase in diameter and contain
   secretory material in their lumen. At 1 month, nest sizes and lacunar
   diameters continue to enlarge. Pachytene oocytes surrounded by somatic
   cells are more frequent. Trabeculae composed of dense irregular
   connective tissue divide cortical nests. Three months after hatching
   oocytes in meiotic stages of prophase I up to diplotene are present. The
   ovary displays many enlarged follicles with oocytes in diplotene arrest,
   thecal layers, lamp-brush chromosomes, and complete layers of follicular
   cells. The medulla is an elaborated complex of vascularized lacunae
   underlying the cortex and often containing discrete lymphoid aggregates.
   While the general morphology of the alligator ovary is similar to that
   of the chicken ovary, the progression of oogenesis and folliculogenesis
   around hatching is notably slower in alligators. Diplotene oocytes are
   observed at hatching in chickens, but not until 3 months in alligators.
   Folliculogenesis is completed at 3 weeks in chickens whereas it is still
   progressing at 3 months in alligators.},

Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is an endocrine disease, which accounts for 9\% of
   deaths worldwide. The aim of oral therapy is to reach normoglycemia to
   prevent later complications. Among glucose-lowering medications,
   a-glucosidase inhibitors delay the absorption of ingested carbohydrates,
   reducing the postprandial glucose and insulin peaks. In the present
   study, we tested the butanolic extracts of four Mexican plants with
   respect to their alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity, without
   excluding other possible mechanisms of action. The plants Cecropia
   obtusifolia Bertol., Equisetum myriochaetum Schlecht \& Chain, Acosmium
   panamense (Benth.) Yacolev and Malmea depressa (Baill) R.E. Fries are
   used in traditional medicine to treat type 2 diabetes. In previous
   studies, we have demonstrated these plants' hypoglycemic activity and
   determined the phytochemical composition of their extracts. Our results
   in n-STZ diabetic rats loaded with maltose showed that Malmea and
   Acosmium extracts decreased plasma glucose significantly from 30 min on
   resembling the effect of acarbose. Cecropia extract produced the highest
   reduction of plasma glucose, and at 90 min, the glucose level was lower
   than the fasting level, which suggests another mechanism of action.
   Equisetum did not exert any effect. In vitro assays of alpha-glucosidase
   activity showed an IC50 of 14 mu g/ml for Cecropia, 21 mu g/ml for
   Malmea, and 109 mu g/ml for Acosmium, which were lower than that of
   acarbose (128 mu g/ml). Equisetum did not show any significant effect on
   this assay, either. These results contribute to understand the mechanism
   of action of these plants on glucose metabolism. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {Cecropia obtusifolia Bertol. (Cecropiaceae) is a tree that grows in
   secondary vegetation in the tropical rain forest along both coasts of
   Mexico. Its leaves are used in folk medicine for the treatment of
   diabetes mellitus type 2. The aim of the present studies was the
   evaluation of possible genotoxic effects of the aqueous extract from the
   leaves of Cecropia obtusifolia by means of two different experimental
   assay models: the wing somatic mutation and recombination test in flies
   and the micronucleus test from lymphocytes obtained from patients
   treated with the extract. No toxicity was found to be induced by the
   leaves of Cecropia obtusifolia. The Drosophila wing somatic mutation and
   recombination test (SMART) was applied in the standard version with
   basal biotransformation activity as well as in a variant version with
   increased cytochrome P450-dependent bioactivation capacity. The ranges
   of exposure concentrations for these genotoxicity experiments were
   between 0.82 and 13.32 mg/ml. The extract did not produce any genotoxic
   effect; however it showed a non significant antigenotoxic effect. The
   human micronucleus assay in vivo was performed with cultured lymphocytes
   obtained from six diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients treated daily with
   13.5 g of the aqueous extract between 32 and 85 days. No statistically
   significant increases in cytotoxicity and/or genotoxicity between
   control and diabetic blood samples were observed. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {Marine planktonic dinoflagellates of the order dinophysiales (Dinophyta)
   from coasts of the tropical Mexican Pacific, including two new species
   of the genus Amphisolenia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM},

Volume = {88},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Despite a recent revision of the dinoflagellates of the order
   Dinophysiales on Mexican coasts and a checklist of dinoflagellates from
   the Mexican Pacific, many records still need to be confirmed, for there
   are very few reliable illustrations and/or descriptions. In this paper,
   species composition and distribution of dinoflagellates belonging to the
   Dinophysiales, the product of the analysis of net phytoplankton material
   collected from coasts of the tropical Mexican Pacific (Jalisco to
   Chiapas) are presented. The material has been studied using light
   microscopy, although a few species were also studied by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). Forty-one species from five genera were
   identified, with two new records annotated for the Mexican Pacific:
   Amphisolenia thrinax and Metaphalacroma skogsbergii, and two new species
   of the genus Amphisolenia, Amphisolenia fusiformis sp. nov. and
   Amphisolenia michoacana sp. nov. Illustrations, dimensions and
   distribution data are provided for each species, and descriptions of the
   new species are also given. Amphisolenia palmata, A. rectangulata, A.
   truncata, Dinophysis apicata, D. hindmarchii, Histioneis biremis, H.
   crateriformis, H. pulchra, Ornithocercus cristatus, O. heteroporoides
   and O. orbiculatus arc illustrated for thefirst time in the waters of
   the Mexican Pacific. The number of species found in this study is
   relatively low. The species Dinophysis norvegica and D. sacculus,
   reported in previous papers, do not seem to occur in Mexican waters, as
   their distribution is rather limited to the Mediterranean Sea and the
   North Atlantic, respectively. Finally, the identity of certain species
   of Dinophysis and the nature of the new species described here are
   discussed.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {117},

Abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) is an evolutionarily conserved structure
   that mediates synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase
   I. Previous studies have established that the chromatin of homologous
   chromosomes is organized in loops that are attached to the lateral
   elements (LEs) of the SC. The characterization of the genomic sequences
   associated with LEs of the SC represents an important step toward
   understanding meiotic chromosome organization and function. To isolate
   these genomic sequences, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assays in rat spermatocytes using an antibody against SYCP3, a major
   structural component of the LEs of the SC. Our results demonstrated the
   reproducible and exclusive isolation of repeat deoxyribonucleic acid
   (DNA) sequences, in particular long interspersed elements, short
   interspersed elements, long terminal direct repeats, satellite, and
   simple repeats. The association of these repeat sequences to the LEs of
   the SC was confirmed by in situ hybridization of meiotic nuclei shown by
   both light and electron microscopy. Signals were also detected over the
   chromatin surrounding SCs and in small loops protruding from the lateral
   elements into the SC central region. We propose that genomic repeat DNA
   sequences play a key role in anchoring the chromosome to the protein
   scaffold of the SC.},

Abstract = {Two genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunits, Cox2a and Cox2b, are
   present in the nuclear genomes of apicomplexan parasites and show
   sequence similarity to corresponding genes in chlorophycean algae. We
   explored the presence of COX2A and COX2B subunits in the cytochrome c
   oxidase of Toxoplasma gondii. Antibodies were raised against a synthetic
   peptide containing a 14-residue fragment of the COX2A polypeptide and
   against a hexa-histidine-tagged recombinant COX2B protein. Two distinct
   immunochemical stainings localized the COX2A and COX2B proteins in the
   parasite's mitochondria. A mitochondria-enriched fraction exhibited
   cyanide-sensitive oxygen uptake in the presence of succinate. T gondii
   mitochondria were solubilized and subjected to Blue Native
   Electrophoresis followed by second dimension electrophoresis. Selected
   protein spots from the 2D gels were subjected to mass spectrometry
   analysis and polypeptides of mitochondrial complexes 111, IV and V were
   identified. Subunits COX2A and COX2B were detected immunochemically and
   found to co-migrate with complex IV; therefore, they are subunits of the
   parasite's cytochrome c oxidase. The apparent molecular mass of the T
   gondii mature COX2A subunit differs from that of the chlorophycean alga
   Polytomella sp. The data suggest that during its biogenesis, the
   mitochondrial targeting sequence of the apicomplexan COX2A precursor
   protein may be processed differently than the one from its alga]
   counterpart. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fibrocytes are a potential source of lung fibroblasts in idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY \& CELL BIOLOGY},

Pages = {2129-2140},
Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of
   fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and aberrant remodeling of the lung
   parenchyma. However, the sources of fibroblasts in IPF lungs are
   unclear. Fibrocytes are circulating progenitors of fibroblasts
   implicated in wound healing and fibrosis. In this study we evaluated
   evidence for the presence of fibrocytes in the lung of patients with
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by immunofluorescence and confocal
   microscopy. Fibrocytes were identified in tissues in 8 out of 9 fibrotic
   lungs. Combinations including CXCR4 and a mesenchymal marker stained
   significantly more fibrocytes/mm(2) of tissue compared with combinations
   using CD34 or CD45RO with mesenchymal markers: CXCR4/procollagen-I (10.3
   +/- 2.9 fibrocytes/mm(2)) and CXCR4/prolyl-4-hydroxylase (4.1 +/- 3.1),
   versus CD34/procollagen-I (2.8 +/- 3.0), CD34/alpha SMA (2.2 +/- 1.6)
   and CD45RO/prolyl-4-hydroxylase (1.3 +/- 1.6); p < 0.003. There was a
   positive correlation between the abundance of fibroblastic foci and the
   amount of lung fibrocytes (r=0.79; p < 0.02). No fibrocytes were
   identified in normal lungs. The fibrocyte attractant chemokine CXCL12
   increased in plasma {[}median: 2707.5 pg/ml (648.1-4884.7) versus 1751.5
   pg/ml (192.9-2686.0) from healthy controls; p < 0.003)] and was
   detectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 40\% of the patients
   but not in controls. In the lung CXCL12 was strongly expressed by
   alveolar epithelial cells. A negative correlation between plasma levels
   of CXCL12 with lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)
   (r=-0.56; p < 0.03) and oxygen saturation on exercise was found
   (r=-0.41; p < 0.04). These findings indicate that circulating
   fibrocytes, likely recruited through the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, may
   contribute to the expansion of the fibroblast/myofibroblast population
   in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Rationale: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) exhibits a diverse outcome.
   Patients with acute/subacute HP usually improve, whereas patients with
   chronic disease often progress to fibrosis. However, the mechanisms
   underlying this difference are unknown.
   Objectives: To examine the T-cell profile from patients with subacute HP
   and chronic HP.
   Methods: T cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 25
   patients with subacute HP, 30 patients with chronic HP, and 8 control
   subjects. T-cell phenotype and functional profile were evaluated by flow
   cytometry, cytometric bead array, and immunohistochemistry.
   Measurements and Main Results: Patients with chronic HP showed higher
   CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio (median, 3.05; range, 0.3-15; subacute HP: median,
   1.3; range, 0.1-10; control: median, 1.3; range, 0.7-2.0; P < 0.01), and
   a decrease of gamma delta T cells (median, 2.0; range, 0.5-3.4, subacute
   HP: median, 10; range, 4.8-17; control: median, 15; range, 5-19; P <
   0.01). Patients with chronic HP exhibited an increase in the terminally
   differentiated memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets compared with
   patients with subacute HP (P < 0.05). However, memory cells from chronic
   HIP showed lower IFN-gamma production and decreased cytotoxic activity
   by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Chronic HP displayed a Th2-like phenotype with
   increased CXCR4 expression (median, 6\%; range, 1.7-36, vs. control
   subjects: median, 0.7\%; range, 0.2-1.4; and subacute HP: median, 2.2\%;
   range, 0.1-5.3; P < 0.01), and decreased CXCR3 expression (median,
   4.3\%; range, 1.4-25\%, vs. subacute HP: median, 37\%; range, 4.9-78\%;
   P < 0.01). Likewise, supernatants from antigen-specific-stimulated cells
   from chronic HP produced higher levels of IL-4 (80 +/- 63 pg/ml vs. 25
   +/- 7 pg/ml; P < 0.01), and lower levels of IFN-gamma (3,818 +/- 1671
   pg/ml vs. 100 61 pg/ml; P < 0.01) compared with subacute HP.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that patients with chronic HP lose
   effector T-cell function and exhibit skewing toward Th2 activity, which
   may be implicated in the fibrotic response that characterizes this

   propagation},
Journal = {COMBUSTION THEORY AND MODELLING},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-133},
Abstract = {The propagation of premixed laminar flame in ducts of circular
   cross-section considering a thermal-diffusive model is investigated
   numerically. Heat losses by conduction to the channels walls are taken
   into account using the thermally thin wall regime. The effects and the
   relationship between thickness and diameter of the tube with the flame
   speed propagation are studied and the quenching condition is obtained as
   a function of the heat-loss parameter. The mathematical model employs
   the axisymmetric energy and species equations. The calculations are
   based on a two-step chemistry, with an Arrhenius, energetically neutral,
   radical production reaction followed by an exothermic radical
   recombination reaction. For large values of the heat-loss parameter, the
   wall temperature is close to the free stream temperature and all the
   heat losses through the wall are convected away. No heat feedback
   occurs. On the other hand, for small values of the heat-loss parameter,
   a feedback mechanism occurs by transferring heat from the burned gas to
   the fresh mixture along the tube wall. For values of the heat-loss
   parameter of order unity, the heat feedback mechanism is able to sustain
   the flame propagation and the quenching condition disappears, producing
   an almost planar flame front as the propagation velocity reduces. For
   this two-step reaction mechanism, the radical species behaviour at the
   duct walls seems to have negligible effect on the quenching process.},

Abstract = {The Upper Cretaceous (late Campanian) Cerro del Pueblo Formation,
   Coahuila, Mexico, contains a diverse group of angiosperms represented
   mainly by their reproductive structures. Among these, a new
   permineralized infructescence is recognized based on its morphological
   and anatomical characters. It is a multiple infructescence composed of
   berry fruits With Six locules, each containing a single seed with a
   curved embryo developed from a campylotropous ovule with pendulous
   placentation; integumentary anatomy is similar to that of Phytolacca
   spp. (Phytolaccaceae). Though this new plant from Coahuila shares
   reproductive characters with Phytolacca, the constant number (six) of
   carpels per fruit and pendulous placentation strongly support the
   recognition of a new taxon, Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides
   Cevallos-Ferriz, Estrada-Ruiz, et Perez-Heriandez (Phytolaccaceae,
   Caryophyllales). This new record adds to the known plant diversity of
   low latitude North America (northern Mexico) and demonstrates the long
   geologic history of the group.},

Abstract = {The evolution of a propagating kink in a Sine-Gordon lattice is studied
   asymptotically using an averaged Lagrangian formulation appropriately
   coupled to the effect of the radiation. We find that unlike the
   continuum case the interaction with the Goldstone mode is important to
   explain the acceleration of the kink as it hops along the lattice. We
   develop a discrete WKB type solution to study the interaction of the
   kink and the radiation. In particular using this solution we show how to
   calculate the effect of the Peyrard and Kruskal resonant radiation in
   the energy loss of the kink. We obtain a set of modulation equation
   which explains qualitatively the evolution of the kink with remarkable
   quantitative agreement. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR SIMULATION},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {We have amorphised Si0.5C0.5 by ab initio generating random networks
   with the experimental density of 2.75g/cm3. Two types of crystalline
   supercells were used at the start: one was a diamond-like periodic
   supercell of 64 atoms, containing 32 carbons and 32 silicons, chemically
   ordered, amorphised using Fast Structure, and the other was an fcc
   crystalline periodic supercell with 108 atoms, 54 carbons and 54
   silicons, chemically ordered, amorphised using DMol3 from the suite in
   Materials Studio 3.2. The amorphisation is made by heating the periodic
   samples to just below the melting point (the undermelt-quench approach),
   and then cooling them down to 0K. Then the structures are relaxed by
   annealing and quenching, and finally a geometry relaxation is carried
   out. Our simulations show that Cerius2 and Materials Studio 3.2 give
   equivalent results in general: atoms of one kind are almost completely
   surrounded by the atoms of the other kind. We also find that the two
   codes lead to total and partial radial distribution functions such that
   after weighting them with the corresponding experimental structure
   factors yield curves that are similar and comparable with experiment.
   Also C-C bonds with an average bond length of 1.35 are found.},

   methodology of ARTMAP network and Wavelet Transform is presented. It
   consists of two non-supervised networks which are then used to build a

   trained with time-scale information of perpendicular reflectivity maps.},

Abstract = {The sprouting of modern Mexican ornithology has been drawn up towards
   its beginning in the decade of the 1820, with the explorations by
   Humboldt, Bullock and Deppe. In the middle of the 19(th) century,
   ornithologists associated to the British Museum initiated a period of
   blossoming of the knowledge based on expeditions made by Sumichrast,
   Craveri, and Botteri, which were continued through investigations by
   researchers from Great Britain and United States. It is not until the
   1860s that Montes de Oca, Villada, and Herrera, amongst others, began to
   produce local scientific knowledge. During most of the 20th century, the
   activity of ornithological surveying was carried out by professional
   collectors to obtain specimens that later were sold to the major museums
   and private collectors. Phillips (1960) attributed a greater development
   of the ornithology in Mexico from 1910 to 1960 to the growth of the road
   network and to the activity of the North American researchers and
   students. By 1970s, an important takeoff of ornithological investigation
   in local research institutions takes place, and international
   collaborations are strengthened. In this work, we analyze those initial
   contributions and assess the contribution of the Mexican and foreign
   scientists and aficionados in the knowledge of the birds of Mexico from
   the decade of 1960, based on scientific literature and the scientific
   collections.},

Title = {CONSERVATION OF NEOTROPICAL HERPETOFAUNA: RESEARCH TRENDS AND CHALLENGES},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-375},
Abstract = {The Neotropics harbor between 30-50\% of the world's herpetofauna.
   However, little is known about the ecology and natural history of many
   species, making conservation strategies difficult to plan. After
   reviewing published papers on world herpetofauna conservation, it was
   shown that conservation biology has a low impact factor in scientific
   journals in comparison with other related disciplines such as
   evolutionary biology and ecology. Moreover, herpetology has one of the
   lowest impact factors within the biological sciences journals. The
   number of publications on amphibian and reptile conservation has
   increased in recent years; however, only 31\% of the papers on
   herpetofaunal conservation have been published in high impact journals.
   There are many challenges to overcome in the conservation of the
   Neotropical herpetofauna. Uniform and stable taxonomic nomenclature is
   critical to avoid overestimation of species richness and diversity for
   conservation assessments, and in the context of legal proceedings.
   Herpetofaunal research needs to be conducted within the appropriate
   socio-political and economic framework, in order to effectively
   implement conservation area networks. It is important to reevaluate the
   role of protected area systems in ensuring the persistence of
   communities and populations, and to identify strategies and future
   conservation priorities, based on climate-change scenarios. Population
   and community studies at different spatial and temporal scales are
   necessary to understand herpetofauna responses to anthropogenic
   disturbances, habitat loss and fragmentation, edge and matrix effects,
   and their synergy with micro-climatic gradients, emergent diseases and
   shifting patterns of genetic diversity. One of the biggest challenges
   for herpetofaunal conservation science in the neotropics is to control
   habitat loss and increase landscape connectivity along altitudinal
   gradients, while at the same time control species invasion that alter
   native species' interactions and spread emergent diseases (e.g.
   Chytridiomycosis) facilitated by climate change.},

Title = {Applying niche-based models to predict endangered-hylid potential
   distributions: are neotropical protected areas effective enough?},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Pages = {417-445},
Abstract = {Tropical amphibians face a severe decline crisis with ca. 35\% of
   species being currently threatened in the Neotropics. We selected 16
   endangered-hylid species and used species records to model their
   potential geographical distribution for the continental Neotropics. We
   found that there is a strong influence of slope in hylid geographical
   distribution that interacts synergistically with maximum rainfall and
   temperature changes over the year. We identified some intersecting areas
   of species overprediction along southern Neotropics, which could be
   important for future biological surveys searching for undescribed
   microendemic hylid species. Nine of the 16 studied hylids have small
   geographic ranges with only 25\% of its potential distribution being
   currently protected in the Neotropics. The remaining seven species are
   still in need of additional conservation areas to ensure the protection
   of at least 25\% of its original distribution range in Mesoamerica. Most
   Neotropical endangered hylids have only the periphery of their
   distribution protected with its core distribution outside protected
   areas. These species may be especially threatened because they now occur
   in small, isolated subpopulations due to habitat fragmentation and loss.
   We suggest that conservation efforts for Neotropical hylids should be
   focused on restricted-range species and in the establishment of
   additional conservation area networks in Mesoamerica. Remaining habitats
   for threatened hylids need to be managed as a coordinate network
   including site-scale and landscape-scale actions to buffer the
   extinction-driven process caused by inbreeding, genetic drift, and
   demographic stochasticity.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Referential integrity is an essential global constraint in a relational
   database, that maintains it in a complete and consistent state. In this
   work, we assume the database may violate referential integrity and
   relations may be denormalized. We propose a set of quality metrics,
   defined at four granularity levels: database, relation, attribute and
   value, that measure referential completeness and consistency. Quality
   metrics are efficiently computed with standard SQL queries, that
   incorporate two query optimizations: left outer joins on foreign keys
   and early foreign key grouping. Experiments evaluate our proposed
   metrics and SQL query optimizations on real and synthetic databases,
   showing they can help in detecting and explaining referential errors.

Title = {Approaching the degradome in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY \& CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {1141-1155},
Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, lethal and
   currently untreatable lung disorder of unknown etiology. It is
   characterized by epithelial injury and activation, fibroblastic foci
   formation, and exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
   with the destruction of the lung parenchyma. Despite important progress
   in our understanding of the general mechanisms involved in lung
   fibrogenesis, the pathogenesis of the IPF remains unclear. Although the
   irreversible and progressive fibrosis in the lung suggests a decrease in
   lung degradative machinery, an increasing body of evidence, primarily
   obtained by global gene expression studies, demonstrates a significant
   upregulation of degrading enzymes in IPF In this context, this review
   will focus on some families of the degradome, a term proposed for the
   complete set of proteases that are expressed at a specific time by a
   cell, tissue or an organism. In particular, we will approach recent
   progress in our understanding of the behavior of two families of
   metalloproteases M10 and M12 which are significantly changed in the IPF
   lungs. In general, evidence highlights the increasing diversity in both
   substrates and functions of these enzymes and the complexity of the
   processes in which they are involved, and indicate a critical role in
   the abnormal remodeling of IPF. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Observing Delta Scuti stars is most important as their multi-frequency
   spectrum of radial pulsations provide strong constraints on the physics
   of the stars interior; so any new detection and observation of these
   stars is a valuable contribution to asteroseismology. While performing
   uvby-beta photoelectric photometry of some RR Lyrae stars acquired in
   2005 at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional, Mexico, we also observed
   several standard stars, HD115520 among them. After the reduction this
   star showed indications of variability. In view of this, a new observing
   run was carried out in 2006 during which we were able to demonstrate its
   variability and its nature as a Delta Scuti star. New observations in
   2007 permitted us to determine its periodic content with more accuracy.
   This, along with the uvby-beta photoelectric photometry allowed us to
   deduce its physical characteristics and pulsational modes.},

Abstract = {The recent discovery of a fifth planet bound to 55 Cancri (Fischer et.
   al 2007) motivated us to investigate if this exo-planetary system fits
   some form of the Titius-Bode (TB) law. We found that a simple
   exponential TB relation reproduces very well the five observed major
   semi-axis, provided we assign the orbital n = 6 to the largest a. This
   way of counting leaves empty the position n = 5, a situation curiously
   reminiscent of TB law in our planetary system, before the discovery of
   Ceres. The application of an exponential TB relation to 55 Cancri allows
   us to predict the existence of a planet at a approximate to 2.0 AU with
   a period of P approximate to 1130 days located within the large gap
   between a = 0.781 AU (P = 260 days) and a = 5.77 AU (P = 5218 days).
   With less certainty, we also predict a seventh planet at a approximate
   to 15 AU, with P approximate to 62 years.},

Abstract = {Performance of industrial and utility combustion systems is often
   constrained by limits on pollutant emissions such as CO and NOx. The
   widespread use of the catalytic converter was the response of the
   automotive industry to the legislation of the countries which sets
   limits on pollutant emissions. The catalytic combustion of CO + NO and
   air mixtures in a planar stagnation-point flow over a platinum foil is
   numerically studied in this paper. In order to optimize the operation of
   the platinum converter, chemical kinetic knowledge is necessary,
   therefore a kinetic model is proposed, based on elementary reaction
   steps, that allows to describe the experiments quantitatively. The
   heterogeneous reaction mechanism is modeled with the dissociative
   adsorption of the molecular oxygen and the non-dissociative adsorption
   of CO, together with a surface reaction of the Langmiur-Mnshelwood type
   and the desorption reaction of the adsorbed products, CO(s) and NO(s).
   The resulting governing equations based on the boundary layer theory
   have been numerically integrated by using Runge-Kutta method and the
   response curve has been obtained as a function of the initial mixture
   concentration. The reduction of NO and oxidation of CO in absence and
   presence of 02 has been investigated, and the optimal oxygen feeding
   into the initial mixture concentration for the maximum reduction of CO
   and NO was found and corresponds to the reported experimental results.},

Abstract = {We analyzed genetic variation in the Emerald Toucanet (Aulacorhynchus
   prasinus), a species complex that ranges primarily along the montane
   forests of southern and eastern Mexico south to Bolivia. Segments of
   three mitochondrial DNA genes (cytochrome b, ND2, and ND3) were
   sequenced for a total of 1,159 base pairs. Using maximum parsimony,
   maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis, we found a set of seven
   differentiated populations that correspond to clear geographic breaks
   throughout the highlands of the Neotropics. These genetically distinct
   populations also correspond with the geographic breaks found in previous
   analyses of morphological data. Molecular evidence suggests species
   treatment for four of the Central American clades and three South
   American clades.},

Abstract = {The height of the aquaculture of shrimp, the high demand of the product,
   the overexplolation of wild larvae, the loss of life, the propensity to
   diseases and the little resistance of the larvae of natural mean's,
   impelled the development of investigations of reproduction of shrimps
   for the obtaining of larvae by means of egg-layings in laboratory to
   replace the capture of cultivated wild organisms by, assuring one better
   quality these, which originated the sprouting of the culture of larvae
   of shrimp known like larviculture. In monitoring the shrimp to detect
   mortality factors, slow growth or aspects during its cultivation farms
   and laboratories. Is very important physico-chemical studies on
   environmental, microbiological and physiological; Within the latter are
   the histological studies that allow Lis to know the normal structure of
   each larval stage until it reaches the adult and be able to determine
   the damage caused by various pathogens that affect them.},

Abstract = {Trading ``profits{''} can be obtained by luck or by the implementation
   of a superior trading strategy. In this chapter we discuss the
   difficulties of distinguishing between the two. First, a suitable
   characterization of profit that distinguishes between trading gains and
   market gains is required. Secondly, one needs to be able to characterize
   trading ``strategies{''}. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of a
   genotype-phenotype map to finance, where the genotype is associated with
   the information set and associated decision rules that lead to a given
   set of trading decisions for a given trader, while the phenotype is
   described by the set of observable trading decisions themselves. In AI
   based systems, such as agent-based markets, a strategy is implemented
   algorithmically and so the genotype is explicitly known. In real markets
   however, the genotypic trading strategy of one trader is hidden from the
   rest. The phenotype however, is, in principle, observable. A microscopic
   description at the level of the set of individual trades, however, is
   not sufficient to understand or characterize the strategies at a more
   macroscopic and intuitive one. By introducing a set of coarse grained
   variables that can be used to classify strategy types, we show how these
   variables can then be data mined to understand what differs between an
   intelligent and a lucky strategy. We show that these variables can be
   used to distinguish between different strategy types and can be further
   used to infer the presence of learning and adaptation in the market. We
   illustrate all of the above using data from an experimental political
   market.},

Abstract = {Aberrant wound-healing responses to injury have been implicated in the
   development of pulmonary fibrosis, but the mediators directing these
   pathologic responses have yet to be fully identified. We show that
   lysophosphatidic acid levels increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
   following lung injury in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, and
   that mice lacking one of its receptors, LPA(1), are markedly protected
   from fibrosis and mortality in this model. The absence of LPA1 led to
   reduced fibroblast recruitment and vascular leak, two responses that may
   be excessive when injury leads to fibrosis rather than to repair,
   whereas leukocyte recruitment was preserved during the first week after
   injury. In persons with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lysophosphatidic
   acid levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were also increased, and
   inhibition of LPA1 markedly reduced fibroblast responses to the
   chemotactic activity of this fluid. LPA1 therefore represents a new
   therapeutic target for diseases in which aberrant responses to injury
   contribute to fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

Year = {2008},

Pages = {119-124},
Abstract = {Synchrony in the anthesis of male and female flowers of the hydrophilous
   dioecious marine angiosperm Thalassia testudinum was studied by
   following flower buds of 64 staminate and 34 carpellate flowers in situ
   during night and day to observe the timing of flower opening. Anthesis
   of female flowers occurred throughout the day, with a slight peak
   between 15:00 and 17:00 h. The time lapse between initiation of anthesis
   and full opening of the flowers was similar to 2 to 3 h. Anthesis in
   male flowers was highly synchronized, and all ripe primordia initiated
   anthesis within 1 h at dusk at similar to 18:00 h, and pollen was
   released within 1 to 2 h. Male flowers in anthesis, or briefly after
   anthesis, were a targeted food source for herbivorous fish and >30\% of
   the staminate flowers were consumed during our observations. The highly
   synchronized nocturnal pollen release is unusual for an abiotic
   pollinator, and we hypothesize that this may be a mechanism to ensure
   fertilization or, alternatively, may be a reponse to avoid pollen
   predation by fish.},

Title = {Organic matter in tepetate cultivated with fig tree and grass,

Abstract = {Plants and amendments increase quality of the tepetates once these hard
   layers, abundant in the Mexican Volcanic Belt, have been rototilled. In
   tepetate, which has a mass structure and lacks organic reserves, the
   addition of organic matter (OM) has proven to have a significant effect
   on fertility by supplying N and P, essential for the development of
   biota, and which promotes a stable structurization. Although it is known
   that soil quality is related to the nature of the organic compounds,
   there are few studies referring to the basic compounds of OM, once it
   has been incorporated into hard layers such as tepetate. The objective
   of the present study was to quantify the total organic carbon,
   polysaccharides, humic acids and fulvic acids, supplied to the tepetate
   by cultivation of fig (Ficus carica L.) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana
   Knuth), with the addition of bovine manure and fertilizer, for two
   years. The experiment was conducted in the greenhouse with duripan
   tepetate. The equivalent of 72 Mg ha(-1) of manure was applied per
   experimental unit and fertilization dose of 80-80-20 for fig and
   250-200-00 for grass. The manure doubled the organic carbon content of
   the tepetate from the first months of application. The fertilizer
   influenced the production of polysaccharides. The plants, with and
   without amendments, provided an increase of as much as 100\% of organic
   carbon and polysaccharides. The humic and fulvic acids were not modified
   by the treatments. The highest content of carbon and polysaccharides was
   at 12 months.},

Title = {The effects of fish hydrolysate (CPSP) level on Octopus maya
   (Voss and Solis) diet:: Digestive enzyme activity, blood metabolites,
   and energy balance},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {273},

Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {As has been demonstrated in previous studies, Octopus maya can be fed on
   artificial diets. In the present study six different diets were assayed.
   Five diets were designed to test the effect of percentage of inclusion
   of fish protein concentrate (CPSP: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20\%) and were
   offered to octopuses as a specifically designed artificial diet. The
   sixth diet consisted of frozen crab (Callinectes spp) and was used as
   control diet. Blood metabolites and energy budget of octopuses were
   evaluated to determine how CPSP levels modulate the digestive capacity
   and allow retaining energy for growth. Wild animals (316.4 +/- 9.8 g)
   were used in the study. Results showed that CPSP produced a positive
   specific growth rate (SGR, \% day(-1)) with high value in octopuses fed
   15\% CPSP level. A maximum growth rate of 0.86\% day(-1) was recorded in
   these animals, a value that is extremely low when compared with the SGR
   obtained when animals were fed fresh crab (3.7\% day(-1)). In general,
   blood metabolites were affected by diet composition, indicating that
   some metabolites could reflect the nutritional and/or physiological
   status of octopus. Preliminary reference values for O.maya fed crab were
   found for glucose (0.09 +/- 0.02 mg/ml), lactate (0.004 +/- 0.002
   mg/ml), cholesterol (0.16 +/- 0.02 mg/ml), acylglycerol (0.14 +/- 0.01
   mg/ml), protein (0.37 +/- 0.04 mg/ ml), hemocyanin (1.85 +/- 0.04
   mmol/1), and digestive gland glycogen (1.86 +/- 0.3 mg/g). Total energy
   content can be used as an indicator of tissue metabolic reserves. In the
   present study, higher energy content in the digestive gland and muscle
   was observed in octopuses fed crab, followed by animals fed 15\% CPSP.
   Results from the digestive gland indicated that the retained energy
   derived from glycogen, suggesting that lipids and protein were the main
   sources of variation linked with energy content. In general, digestive
   gland proteases activity and trypsin were induced in octopuses fed 15\%
   CPSP. The capacity of O. maya juveniles to adjust their digestive
   enzymes to different types of food was evidenced. Essential amino acid
   content (EAA) of the diet was not a limiting factor. When dietary EAA
   profiles were compared with O. maya EAA profiles, all dietary EAA
   resulted in a higher concentration than whole body octopus composition.
   In the present study, all experimental groups ingested between 3300 and
   4106 kJ wk(-1) kg(-1) without statistical differences among treatments,
   indicating that experimental diets were as attractive as crab.
   Differences were recorded in the proportion of absorbed energy (Ab, \%)
   between CPSP-based and crab meat diets, suggesting digestion limitations
   associated with artificial diets. The present results indicate that the
   15\% CPSP diet had characteristics that stimulate digestive enzymes and
   reduce energetic costs associated with its digestion (HiE or SDA),
   channeling more biomass production than the other experimental diets.

Title = {Interactions between dopamine and melatonin organize circadian

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {515-523},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Circadian physiology in the vertebrate retina is regulated by several
   neurotransmitters. In the lateral eyes of the green iguana the circadian
   rhythm of melatonin content peaks during the night while the rhythm of
   dopamine peaks during the day. In the present work, the authors explore
   the interaction of these 2 neurotransmitters during the circadian cycle.
   They depleted retinal dopamine with intravitreal injections of
   6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and measured ocular melatonin content in vivo
   throughout I circadian cycle. The circadian rhythm of ocular melatonin
   not only persisted but increased 10-fold in amplitude. This increase was
   substantially reduced by the intraocular administration of dopamine.
   6-OHDA-treated retinas, unlike those from untreated animals, did not
   express a circadian rhythm of melatonin synthesis in vitro. To deplete
   retinal melatonin, the authors pinealectomized iguanas and blocked
   retinal melatonin synthesis by depleting serotonin with intraocular
   injections of 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine. In animals so treated, they found
   that the circadian rhythm of retinal dopamine content was abolished, the
   levels of dopamine were lowered, and the levels of dopamine metabolites
   were greatly increased. The data suggest that in iguanas, the amplitude
   of the circadian rhythm of melatonin synthesis in the eye is suppressed
   by dopamine while the rhythm of dopamine depends, at least in part, on
   the presence of melatonin.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {76},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The linearly polarized Gowdy T-3 model is paradigmatic for studying
   technical and conceptual issues in the quest for a quantum theory of
   gravity since, after a suitable and almost complete gauge fixing, it
   becomes an exactly soluble midisuperspace model. Recently, a new
   quantization of the model, possessing desired features such as a unitary
   implementation of the gauge group and of the time evolution, has been
   put forward and proven to be essentially unique. An appropriate setting
   for making contact with other approaches to canonical quantum gravity is
   provided by the Schrodinger representation, where states are functionals
   on the configuration space of the theory. Here we construct this
   functional description, analyze the time evolution in this context and
   show that it is also unitary when restricted to physical states, i.e.
   states which are solutions to the remaining constraint of the theory.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the connection between the epistemic and the
   ``political{''} dimensions of the metaphor of biformation during the
   early days of the study of Molecular Evolution. While preserving some of
   the meanings already documented in the history of molecular biology, the
   metaphor acquired a new, powerful use as a substitute for ``history.{''}
   A rhetorical analysis of Emile Zuckerkandl's paper, ``Molecules as
   Documents of Evolutionary History,{''} highlights the ways in which
   epistemic claims on the validity and superiority of molecular evidence
   for evolution were intimately connected with authority issues in
   evolutionary biology. The debate is situated within the framework of the
   battle for resources between traditional evolutionists and molecular
   biologists at the beginning of the 1960s. The architects of evolutionary
   synthesis questioned the idea that molecular characters constitute
   ``cleaner{''} and ``more direct{''} evidence of evolution. Nevertheless,
   the information discourse constituted a productive space for the
   development of a new research program that, paradoxically, has made
   explicit the limitations of the information metaphor in reconstructing
   life's history.},

Title = {The importance of birds for conservation in the Neotropical region},

Abstract = {Habitat loss remains the major threat to birds in the Neotropics,
   although there are several additional specific threats, for example
   trade, nest parasitism, invasives on islands, and for seabirds, bycatch.
   Capacity building also remains a key issue for conservation in the area.
   Nevertheless, the region has benefited by a surge in research, with an
   increase in Neotropical avian studies over the last decade, many of them
   incorporating modern techniques for analyzing a variety of data, for
   example vocalization and molecular data. These studies have improved our
   general understanding of the taxonomic status of several forms, and
   their ecology and conservation needs, and the bird-watching community
   has become an important force that can be mobilized to gather
   information and to support conservation efforts. But birds themselves
   are playing now a key role in the development of conservation strategies
   in the region. The important bird areas (IBAs) promoted by BirdLife are
   now a key component in our strategy for defining key biodiversity areas
   (KBAs), by means of which Conservation International is attempting to
   broaden the taxonomic spectrum of the IBA concept. Migratory birds and
   those with large home range are becoming important elements in our
   strategy as we try to move from IBAs and KBAs to large-scale
   biodiversity corridors.},

Abstract = {Twenty five species and seven genera of micorrhizal arbuscular fungi
   (AMF) are reported for the region of Nizanda, Oaxaca, Mexico. To this
   end, soil samples were taken randomly, during the rainy and the dry
   seasons, in corn fields, secondary vegetation areas, as well as in
   primary tropical dry forest. Spores were isolated, identified and
   propagation pots were set. The family Glomeraceae accounted for 44\% of
   the species, followed by Acaulosporaceae (24\%) and Gigasporaceae
   (20\%). In the corn fields 13 species were found, 24 in secondary
   vegetation, and 12 in the tropical dry forest. Among these, Glomus
   dussi, G. verruculosum, Pacispora scintillans and Scutellospora
   erythropa are new records for Mexico. G. constrictum was encountered
   only in the corn fields, whereas Acaulospora delicata, A. foveata, A.
   mellea, A. scrobiculata, Entrophospora infrequens, Gigaspora decipiens,
   Glomus claroideum, G.fulvum and G. geosporum occurred in the three
   environments. No species were restricted to the tropical dry forest.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted in a subtropical mountainous area of the Sierra
   Sur de Oaxaca, southern Mexico. This region has been reported to have a
   high diversity of soils due to erosion and deposition by slope processes
   triggered by seismic activity and rainstorms. In this study, lithologic
   properties indicate that 18 of 24 soil profiles received sediments as
   result of slope processes (landslides, colluvialion, accumulation of the
   material washed out by sheet and inter-rill erosion). The profiles
   showing sediment deposition on the surface were formed on all landforms,
   except steep backslopes, where the loss of material is more intensive.
   The effect of newly accumulated sediment was previously underestimated,
   and varies from slight modification of soil properties to complete
   burial of a soil that forces pedogenesis to begin from ``time zero{''}.
   Sediment accumulation due to slope processes should be included into a
   general pedogenie model for the study area.},

   on the soil. The extraction of residues, and burns with disk caused a
   fall in the organic carbon soil OC of the 20\% and 37\% in the 0-5 cm
   and 5-15 cm layer. The loss of light carbon was of the 35\% in surface
   and of the 50\% in subsurface. The aggregate mean weight diameter wet
   sieving was affected by residue extraction. The smaller aggregates were
   found following the application of burning and tillage practices. The
   change in aggregate diameter indicated a marked process of loss of the
   structure associated with the decrease of the organic carbon and with
   the light carbon to apply intensive practices of site.},

Abstract = {In spite of the development of ever more elaborate techniques for the
   calculation of nuclear properties, the calculation of the most basic
   property of atomic nuclei, their mass, still represents a challenging
   task. The differences between measured masses and Liquid Drop Model
   (LDM) predictions have well known regularities. They contain information
   related to shell closures, nuclear deformation and the residual nuclear
   interactions, and display a well defined pattern, which can be viewed as
   a two-dimensional image. In the present work the more than 2000 known
   nuclear masses are studied as an array in the N-Z plane viewed through a
   mask, behind which the approximately 7000 unknown unstable nuclei that
   can exist between the proton and neutron drip lines are hidden.
   Employing a Fourier transform deconvolution method these masses can be
   predicted. Measured masses are reconstructed with and r.m.s. error of
   less than 100 keV. Potential applications of the present approach are
   outlined.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The proliferation of methods in the last decades has led some authors to
   question whether biogeography is a coherent discipline. Biotas are
   complex mosaics due to dispersal (expansion of distributions) and
   vicariance (fragmentation of distributions), having complex, reticulate
   histories, which necessarily need to be studied through the integration
   of different methodologies. An evolutionary biogeographical analysis may
   involve five steps: (1) recognition of biotic components (sets of
   spatio-temporally integrated taxa due to common history), through
   panbiogeography and methods used to identify areas of endemism; (2)
   contrastation of the biotic components and identification of the
   vicariant events that fragmented them, through cladistic biogeography
   and comparative phylogeography; (3) establishment of a hierarchic
   arrangement of the components in a biogeographic system of realms,
   regions, dominions, provinces and districts; (4) identification of
   cenocrons (sets of taxa with similar origins and ages), dated using
   intraspecific phylogeography, molecular clocks and fossils; and (5)
   formulation of a geobiotic scenario, that explains the evolution of the
   biotic components and cenocrons, integrating geological and tectonical
   information.},

Abstract = {Lake Huetzalin (Xochimilco) is a shallow waterbody in Mexico City with a
   dominance of the littoral cladocerans Simocephalus vetulus, Alona
   rectangula, and Pleuroxus aduncus. Here, we present data on the life
   table and population dynamics of these three cladoceran species on two
   types of diets (alga Scenedesmus acutus and detritus). We also analyzed
   the effect of competition on population growth using Scenedesmus, which
   proved to be the better diet than detritus. We hypothesize that feces of
   the larger cladoceran species (S. vetulus) could be a food source for
   the smaller taxa (A. rectangula and P. aduncus). Experiments were
   conducted in 100 ml beakers with 50 ml of medium in each at a
   temperature of 23 +/- 1 degrees C. We studied the demography of three
   test species using two food types with four replicates for each
   treatment in the life table experiments. Based on the data thus obtained
   we further studied the competition between the cladocerans on a diet of
   Scenedesmus. The maximal growth rates obtained for P. aduncus, S.
   vetulus, and A. rectangula fed Scenedesmus acutus were: 0.1, 0.3, and
   0.5 d(-1), respectively. Among the test species, S. vetulus had the
   highest survivorship of 77 days when cultured on detritus and P. aduncus
   the lowest of 20 days on Scenedesmus. The gross reproductive rate
   (offspring female(-1) lifespan(-1)) ranged from 6 neonates in Pleuroxus
   to 160 in Simocephalus per female. From the competition experiments
   conducted using alga as the diet, we observed that A. rectangula and,

Abstract = {The composition and temporal changes of edaphic microarthropods in both
   litter layer and soil were analyzed in a tropical dry forest ecosystem
   in Western Mexico. Sampling was carried out from June 1991 to July 1992
   in two small watersheds at the Chamela Biological Station (Jalisco
   State, Mexico). At each watershed 10 random cores samples, 11 cm in
   diameter and 5 cm depth, were taken monthly from each biotope from an
   area of 100 m(2) supercript stop. Fauna was extracted by
   Berlese-Tullgren funnels and preserved in 75\% ethanol. The total
   abundance of arthropods was 96,338 specimens, belonging to 33 taxa.
   Numerically dominant groups were Prostigmata, Cryptostigmata, Collembola
   and Mesostigmata, which constituted 92.6\% of the total abundance. The
   effect of current monthly precipitation and temperature on density of
   total Arthropoda and different Orders was also investigated.
   Precipitation and temperature were significantly correlated with
   Collembola and Mesostigmata densities and also with total arthropod. The
   seasonal variation in the amount of litterfall was also significantly
   related to the abundance of arthropod in the litter layer biotope.},

Abstract = {The essence of pedogenesis, as a synergetic process, consists in
   generation, selection, accumulation and differentiation of the solids
   produced in the course of bio-abiotic processes functioning within a
   soil body. Soil formation in the broad sense is the result of synergetic
   processes of self-organization of an in situ soil system during its
   functioning in time and space. Soil formation, sensu stricto, is the
   transformation of the solid-phase lithomatrix (parent material) of the
   soil system into the pedomatrix (soil body, soil mantle). Pedogenesis is
   perceived as an integration of specific pedogenic processes (SPP); each
   of them characterized by a definite set of solid-phase pedogenic
   features. Each soil body is formed by a combination of some SPP. The
   whole set of SPP may be grouped in accordance with their essence,
   characteristic times (rates) and reversibility-irreversibility. In terms
   of characteristic times (rates) they may be arranged in three main
   groups: rapid (10(1-2) years), medium-rate (10(3-4) years), and Slow
   (10(5-6) years). Soil system functioning and soil formation are
   intimately linked but fundamentally different processes: the former is
   infinite in time, if not interrupted by external factors; the latter, as
   any self-organization process, is finite in time and tends to reach a
   steady state. The theoretical grouping of the pedogenic processes
   according to their essence and self-termination or quasi-equilibrium is
   proposed. All the diagnostic soil horizons (as defined in WRB) are
   perceived as more or less stable and ``mature{''} degrees of soil
   self-development. They may be separated into favorable and unfavorable
   with respect to their suitability for biota. Favorable conditions are
   generally common in 12 out of 39 diagnostic horizons and properties
   (32\%). They are mainly influenced by biotic fluxes and cycles, which
   are comparable to, or exceed, abiotic fluxes and cycles in their
   strength and capacity. In this case, biota transforms and improves the
   environment rather than adapts to it. Unfavorable conditions are more
   common in 27 out of 39 diagnostic horizons and properties (68\%). They
   are influenced by the mutual action both of biotic and abiotic fluxes
   and cycles. In this case, biota adapts to the environment rather than
   improves it. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We document variation among 13 populations of distinct species of the
   lizard genus Xenosaurus in four key reproductive traits: minimum size at
   maturity, litter size, size at birth, and relative clutch mass (RCM).
   Despite a common flattened morphology, considerable variation occurs in
   the examined traits. Minimum size at maturity varied between 92 and 110
   mm snout-vent length (SVL), average litter size ranged between 2.1 and
   5.7 newborns per female, mean size at birth varied between 40.6 and 51.6
   mm SVL, and average RCM ranged between 0.16 and 0.35. We also found
   considerable interpopulational variation in mean size of reproductive
   females (from 102.9-119.2 mm SVL) and in the length of the birth season
   (from about one month to four months distributed between early May and
   late September). Litter size and RCM were the most variable traits with
   coefficients of variation above 20, whereas the other traits showed
   coefficients of variation between 4 and 7.4. Only the minimum size at
   maturity showed an allometric effect. Litter size and size at birth were
   negatively correlated, which we interpret as evidence of a trade-off
   between these two traits. Cluster analyses revealed the existence of two
   main life-history strategies: populations with relatively large litters
   of small young and populations with small litters of large young. We
   suggest further ecological and phylogenetic analyses to explain the
   patterns of variation and covariation observed in the studied traits.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of temperature fluctuations of a gas of Brownian particles
   in local equilibrium with a nonequilibrium heat bath are described using
   an approach consistent with Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics. We use

   Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution in phase space
   including the local intensive variables fluctuations. We contract the
   description to obtain an effective probability distribution (EPD) from
   which the mass density, van Hove's function and the dynamic structure
   factor of the system are obtained. The main result is to show that in
   the long time limit the EPD exhibits a similar behavior as the
   superstatistics distribution of nonextensive statistical mechanics
   (NESM), therefore implying that the coarse-graining procedure is
   responsible for the so-called nonextensive effects. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},

Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {The 5d electron-based Sr2-xLaxIrO4 system ( 0 <= x <= 0.2) has been
   synthesized by a solid-state route. The x = 0 composition is a
   nonmetallic weak ferromagnet with a Curie temperature at about 240 K.
   The crystal structure behaviour and magnetic properties exhibited by
   this Sr2-xLaxIrO4 system can be explained on the basis of the extended
   character of the 5d electrons of the Ir cation and its valence states.
   Rietveld analysis of x-ray powder diffraction on Sr2IrO4 agrees well
   with previous structural neutron experiments. Furthermore, density
   functional theory ( DFT) calculations predict that I 4(1)/ acd
   represents a more stable crystal structure than K2NiF4 ( I 4/ mmm).
   Electrical resistivity and magnetic properties of Sr2-xLaxIrO4 are
   strongly dependent on the Ir3+ content. The Sr2-xLaxIrO4 magnetic
   behaviour in the range of 2-240 K can be ascribed to a weak ferromagnet,
   produced by an array of canted antiferromagnetically ordered Ir4+
   magnetic moments.},

Title = {Rhythms of high-grade block in an ionic model of a strand of regionally
   ischemic ventricular muscle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {249},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-45},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Electrical alternans, a beat-to-beat alternation in the
   electrocardiogram or electrogram, is frequently seen during the first
   few minutes of acute myocardial ischemia, and is often immediately
   followed by malignant cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular
   tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. As ischemia progresses,
   higher-order periodic rhythms (e.g., period-4) can replace the period-2
   alternans rhythm. This is also seen in modelling work on a
   two-dimensional (2-D) sheet of regionally ischemic ventricular muscle.
   In addition, in the experimental work, ventricular arrhythmias are
   overwhelmingly seen only after the higher-order rhythms arise. We
   investigate an ionic model of a strand of ischemic ventricular muscle,
   constructed as a 3-cm-long 1-D cable with a centrally located 1-cm-long
   segment exposed to an elevated extracellular potassium concentration
   ({[}K+](o)). As {[}K+](o) is raised in this ``ischemic segment{''} to
   represent one major effect of ongoing ischemia, the sequence of rhythms
   \{1:1 -> 2:2 (alternans) -> 2:1\} is seen. With further increase in
   {[}K+](o), one sees higher-order periodic 2N:M rhythms \{2:1 -> 4:2 ->
   4:1 -> 6:2 -> 6:1 -> 8:2 -> 8:1\}. In a 2N:M cycle, only M of the 2N
   action potentials generated at the proximal end of the cable
   successfully traverse the ischemic segment, with the remaining ones
   being blocked within the ischemic segment. Finally, there is a
   transition to complete block \{8:1 -> 2:0 -> 1:0\} (in an n:0 rhythm,
   all action potentials die out within the ischemic segment). Changing the
   length of the ischemic segment results in different rhythms and
   transitions being seen: e.g., when the ischemic segment is 2 cm long,
   the period-6 rhythms are not seen; when it is 0. 5 cm long, there is a
   3:1 rhythm interposed between the 2:1 and 1:0 rhythms. We discuss the
   relevance of our results to the experimental observations on the
   higher-order rhythms that presage reentrant ischemic ventricular
   arrhythmias. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Application of parsimony analysis of endemicity to Mexican gymnosperm

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {92},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) was used to analyse the
   distributional patterns of 124 species of Mexican gymnosperms, using two
   different sample units: grid-cells and biogeographical provinces. PAE
   analyses were based on distributional data from herbarium specimens and
   specialized literature. Two data matrices were constructed for 60
   grid-cells of 2 degrees and 14 biogeographical provinces. The analysis
   of the 2 degrees grid-cell matrix led to 7084 cladograms. The strict
   consensus cladogram showed several clades equivalent to the results
   obtained with the biogeographical provinces. Three clades agree with
   some principal regions of distribution of Mexican pines, previously
   identified by several authors, located at the northern portion of the
   Baja California peninsula, the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Sierra
   Madre Oriental. These areas represent important centres of species
   diversity and endemism for Mexican gymnosperms. The analysis of the
   province matrix led to two most parsimonious cladograms, which only
   differed in the position of the Sierra Madre Occidental province. The
   iterative procedure PAE with progressive character elimination was
   applied to identify generalized tracks, where clades of provinces were
   considered equivalent to generalized tracks, and each time a cladogram
   was obtained, species defining its clades were deleted and a new run was
   undertaken. We found five generalized tracks, mainly located in montane
   provinces. The distribution patterns of gymnosperms agree with the
   existence of several Mexican biogeographical provinces, and a different
   historical biogeography of the Mexican peninsulas from the rest of the
   country is evident.},

Title = {Glutathione depletion activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)

Abstract = {Because mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are downstream
   effectors of antioxidant responses, changes in GSH levels in an organism
   might induce organ-specific responses. To test our hypothesis, mice were
   treated intraperitoneally with L-buthionine-S-R-sulfoximine (BSO) to
   inhibit GSH synthesis. A time-related GSH depletion in the liver and
   kidney correlated with p38(MAPK) phosphorylation and induction of
   thioredoxin ! (Tx-1) transcription. This positive regulation was
   associated with nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B and ATF-2 and
   gamma-Jun phosphorylation in the liver, but only c-Jun phosphorylation
   in the kidney. Increased levels of GSH were observed in the brain
   together with extracellular regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) activation, Nrf2
   nuclear accumulation, and increases in transcription of Nrf2, xCT,
   T-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma GCSr), and Tx-1. Pretreatment with
   MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and U0126, or addition of the exogenous thiol
   N-acetylcysteine, abrogated both p38(MAPK) and ERK2 activation as well
   as downstream effects on gene expression. No effect on gamma GCSr was
   observed. These results indicate that in mice, GSH depletion is
   associated with p38(MAPK) phosphorylation in the liver and kidney and
   with ERK2 activation in the brain, in what could be considered part of
   the brain's protective response to thiol depletion. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {A model based on the in vitro-to-glasshouse system used in potato seed
   production programs was implemented to investigate the effects of
   abscisic acid (ABA) on the induction of freezing tolerance in
   microplants of two potato cultivars with different sensitivity.
   Microplants 28 days old, cultured in the presence of ABA, were
   transferred to soil and exposed to -6 C for 4 h. ABA enhanced survival
   two-fold but inhibited stem growth by 91\%. Recovery from the ABA effect
   was evaluated under in vitro and glasshouse conditions. Plants recovered
   from the ABA stress had increased growth rate. When microplants
   incubated in ABA were subcultured to ABA-free medium for 28 days, growth
   increased 10.4 and 6.9-fold, whereas the growth in controls was 0.36 and
   0.6-fold for `Atlantic' and `Alpha', respectively. Enzymatic activities
   of peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, along with H2O2 content,
   significantly increased in microplants incubated in ABA. When the
   microplants were transferred to ABA-free medium, these parameters
   declined to control levels. No significant differences were obtained for
   any of the parameters evaluated in microplants transferred for 120 days
   to a glasshouse for recovery. ABA did not induce long-term effects on
   tuber production. These results demonstrate the potential of ABA in the
   induction of freezing tolerance in microplants transferred to soil.
   Responses to ABA were associated with the antioxidant system and H2O2
   content in the induction of freezing tolerance in potato.},

Title = {The ornithology of the Real Expedicion Botanica a Nueva Espana

Abstract = {Until recently, a major gap has existed in our knowledge regarding
   Mexican bird information from the Real Expedicion Botanica a Nueva
   Espana in the late 1700s. This expedition (1787-1803) was commanded by
   Martin de Sesse; the Mexican scientist Jose Mariano Mocino joined the
   group in 1790, but his ornithological findings were never published and
   have long been considered lost. However, study of the Sesse-Mocino
   ornithological results began in 1979 with the appearance of a small
   collection of original paintings, apparently from the expedition. Later,
   in 1997, unpublished manuscripts were discovered in the library of the
   Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid that included descriptions
   of many bird species, again apparently Sesse-Mocino material. These
   discoveries, covering an important portion of the overall ornithological
   results of the expedition, make possible a broader study of the
   Sesse-Mocino ornithology: a taxonomic list using modern nomenclature, an
   analysis of the correspondence between the paintings and the
   manuscripts, and conclusions regarding the provenance of those
   materials. Of a total of 83 paintings available, we were able to
   identify 78 to species, and 5 only to family. In the manuscripts, 290
   species were treated, but for 27, the descriptions were fragmentary and
   insufficient for identification; of the remaining 263 species, we
   arrived at a species-level identification for 242, and identified the
   remainder to genus (19) or family (2). The recent discovery of these
   ornithological texts and paintings offers a unique view of the history
   of ornithology as well as of the environmental history of Mexico.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted using a bioenergetics approach to generate
   information on energy requirement and feed utilization of Litopenaeus
   stylirostris. Animals (initial mean weight 21 +/- 1 g were fed ad
   libitum six experimental diets, ranging from 25 to 58\% crude protein
   (CP), for 50 days.
   Weight gain increased from 21 to 30 g with increasing dietary protein
   level. Survival rates averaged 80\%. Basal metabolism (HeE) and heat
   increment of feeding (HiE) were monitored using respirometry. HeE was on
   average I U shrimp(-1) day(-1) or 47 U kg live weight(-1) day (22
   kJ/kg(0.8). d(-1)), slightly more than what is observed in fish. HiE
   averaged 0.2 W/sbrimp(-1) day(-1) or 10 W kg live weight(-1) day(-1) (4
   kJ/kg(0.8) d(-1)). It represented 3 1 \% and 12\% digestible energy
   intake (DET) for shrimp fed on 58\% CP and 25\% CP diet respectively.
   Non-fecal (UE + ZE) energy calculated on the basis of N-ammonia
   excretion averaged 0.2 jig N-ammonia/g dry wt./ mn or 25 J live
   shrimp(-1) day(-1) in fasting stage and increased to 40 J in
   post-prandial stage. Ammonia production increased with increasing
   dietary crude protein (CP). The O:N ratio indicated that protein was
   increasingly used as an energy substrate as CP increased. The
   information was used to construct an energy budget for shrimp fed a
   protypical 40\% CP diet. Gross energy intake (IE) was estimated at 6.5 W
   live shrimp(-1) day(-1); digestible energy intake (DEI) at 5, urinary
   and branchial excretion (UE +ZE) at 1.2, total heat production (HE) at
   3.2; recovered energy (RE) at 0.6 (or 11\% DEI). L. stylirostris adults
   issued from domesticated strain appeared to be more efficiently
   utilizing (i.e. converting into carcass energy) protein than
   carbohydrates. This preliminary energy budget can be used to construct
   theoretical feed requirement and waste outputs model for L.
   stylirostris. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {We use a nonintrusive optical technique for heterodyne detection of the
   light scattered elastically by the molecules of a moving transparent
   gas, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. It can be shown that the
   signal that comes out of the photodetector is proportional to the
   spatial Fourier transform as a function of time of the density
   fluctuations, for a wave vector given by the optical set-up. This is the
   only technique we are aware of that can study density fluctuations
   inside a flow.
   In this paper we present results obtained from a supersonic axisymmetric
   air jet. The signal that comes out of the photodetector is processed,
   and the power spectrum calculated. In the spectrum, density fluctuations
   of two different origins can be identified: acoustic, that is, those
   that propagate at the speed of sound and are related to pressure
   variations, and entropic, those that have constant pressure and are
   convected by the flow. At certain locations we have found an additional
   peak related to the interaction between the flow and the shock
   structure. Furthermore, Rayleigh scattering can be used to visualize the
   shock structure of the flow. We provide supporting images for our
   results.},

Abstract = {One of the main problems in Mexico is soil degradation due to the change
   of its use as cropland; this change causes deterioration, which may lead
   to total loss and outcrop of tepetate. Tepetates are hardened layers of
   volcanic origin in zones of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt; they
   present low percentages of organic matter and of nutrients, and a
   massive structure, which makes them impermeable and limits plant growth.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three organic
   amendments, one vegetal species (Ficus carica L.), mycorrhiza (Glomus
   spp), and time, on the physical and chemical characteristics of a
   fragmented tepetate. The experimental design was completely randomized
   with a 4x3x2 factorial arrangement of treatments with the following
   factors and levels: 1) amendment (without amendment, compost,
   vermicompost, and manure), 2) rig tree (without plant, with plant, and
   plant plus inoculum); time (6 and 12 months). Application of organic
   matter, rig tree, and mycorrhiza favored the formation of aggregates
   from tepetate and their stability. The pH, CIC, content of organic
   matter, and exchangeable cations of tepetate were favorably modified and
   allowed developing of the rig tree. The changes in physical and chemical
   characteristics of tepetate through addition of amendments, time, and
   fig tree, favor its habilitation and incorporation to productivity.},

Abstract = {Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were carried out in an
   experimental investigation of laminar mixed convection in a vertical
   duct with a square cross-section. The main downward water-flow is driven
   by gravity while a portion of a lateral side is heated, and buoyancy
   forces produce non-stationary vortex structures close to the heated
   region. Various ranges of the Grashof number, Gr are studied in
   combination with the Reynolds number, Re varying from 300 to 700. The
   values of the generalized buoyancy parameter or Richardson number, Ri =
   Gr/Re-2 parallel to the Grashof number are included in the results. The
   influence of these nondimensional parameters and how they affect the
   fluid flow structure and vortex sizes and locations are reported. The
   flow patterns are nonsymmetric, periodic, and exhibit increasing
   complexity and frequency for increasing buoyancy. For the averaged
   values of the resulting vortex dimensions. it was found that a better
   and more congruent representation occurs when employing the Grashof and
   Reynolds numbers as independent parameters. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {A new system to optimize both control rod pattern and fuel-loading
   design in boiling water reactors is shown. The system is named OCOTH,
   and it is based on heuristic techniques such as genetic algorithms,
   neural networks, and ant colonies. Each heuristic technique is used to
   design a part of the optimization process. So, the neural network finds
   an initial fuel loading with a Haling burnup calculation. The ant colony
   system optimizes full-power control rod pattern of the initial fuel
   loading. Finally, the genetic algorithm optimizes fuel loading with the
   optimized control rod patterns. The ant colony system and the genetic
   algorithm perform an iterative loop until a stop criterion is
   fulfilled;for example, control rod pattern and fuel-loading convergence.
   The OCOTH system was tested in an equilibrium cycle of Mexico's Laguna
   Verde Nuclear Power Plant. We found very good results in control rod
   pattern and fuel-loading coupled optimization.},

Title = {Elastic properties of superconducting NbB2+x obtained from
   first-principles calculations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {19},
Number = {37},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {First-principles calculations have been performed on NbB2+x to obtain
   its elastic constants using the plane wave pseudopotential method based
   on density functional theory, within the generalized gradient
   approximation. We have derived the bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's
   moduli, Poisson's ratios and elastic anisotropies for NbB2+x
   polycrystalline aggregates. The elastic properties obtained here show
   that the structure becomes less symmetrical as the boron content
   increases. The higher elastic anisotropies A(K) and A(G) were associated
   with the higher superconducting transition temperature T-c reported for
   this material (Escamilla et al 2004 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 16 5979).
   Using the Debye temperature, theta(D), and T-c, the electron-phonon
   coupling constant. was obtained from the McMillan equation. For the
   concentrations from (B/Nb) = 2.20(1) to 2.34(1), the values of lambda
   increase from 0.497 to 0.572; this suggests that NbB2+x is a weakly
   coupled Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type superconductor.},

Title = {Firing of transcription and compartmentalization of splicing factors in
   tomato radicle nuclei during germination},

Abstract = {Background information. Germination is a well-characterized process in
   which embryo cells of seeds experience a programmed transition from
   quiescence to proliferation. For this reason they constitute a very good
   system to analyse nuclear evolution from a dehydrated practically
   inactive state until the steady state of proliferation. We analysed the
   temporal and spatial organization of transcription and splicing factors
   in nuclei of tomato radicle cells during germination. To address this
   issue we performed in situ immunodetection of several markers of these
   processes: the Z-DNA stretches forming behind the active RNA
   polymerases, the splicing proteins U2B{''} and Sm, and the trimethyl
   guanosin cap of small nuclear RNA. The concomitant structural changes of
   the different nuclear compartments were studied in meristematic nuclei
   by electron microscopy and high-resolution cytochemistry for DNA and
   ribonucleoproteins.
   Results. In quiescent cells practically no Z-DNA stretches were detected
   and splicing components localized mainly to one or two Cajal bodies
   associated to the nucleolus. In early germination, a massive
   de-condensation of chromatin and nucleolar Z-DNA conformation stretches
   were first detected, followed by the relocation of scarce splicing
   components to the small interchromatin spaces. Nucleoplasmic Z-DNA
   stretches were not detected until 4 h of imbibition and were accompanied
   by an important increase of splicing components in this nuclear domain.
   Soon after the post-germination stage, transcription and splicing
   topology and nuclear organization in meristematic nuclei resemble those
   in steady state growing tomato roots.
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that, in tomato, dormant nuclei
   splicing factors are stored in nucleolar Cajal bodies. In early
   germination, RNA polymerase I transcription is first activated, whereas
   mRNA transcription is fired later and is accompanied by a massive
   de-condensation of chromatin and accumulation of splicing factors in the
   interchromatin domains. Nucleoplasmic Cajal bodies appear later in
   germination.},

Abstract = {A generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) statistical theory of
   superconductors accounts not for BB interactions but rather for
   boson-fermion (BF) interactions. It extends the 1989 Friedberg-Lee BEC
   theory by including as bosons two-hole (2h) singlet Cooper pairs (CPs)
   in addition to the usual two-electron (2e) ones. It contains BCS theory
   when both kinds of pairs are equal in the BE condensate and in excited
   states-at least as far as identically reproducing the BCS gap equation
   for all temperatures T as well as the T = 0 BCS condensation energy for
   all couplings. As a ternary BF model with BF interactions, it yields
   T(c)s one-to-three orders-of-magnitude higher than BCS theory with the
   same Cooper/BCS model electron-phonon interaction. These T(c)s appear to
   be surprisingly insensitive to the BF interaction. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {The structure community of cunaxids mites was studied at a tropical dry
   forest in the Chamela Biological Station. Jalisco, Mexico. Monthly
   samples of litter and soil were taken during one year (July 1991-May
   1992), in two small watersheds. A total of 43 species was recorded. We
   studied their abundance, species frequency (F), rareness and relative
   abundance (Ar), density (ind m(-2)), species richness (S), Shannon's
   diversity index (W), and Pielou's evenness index (J'). The species
   richness was similar in litter and soil (38 species), but species
   composition was different. The higher density was found in soil, with 5
   074 ind m(-2); litter density was 2 199 ind m(-2). The subfamilies with
   the highest density in both biotopes were Coleoscirinae (H = 1 127 ind
   m(-2); S=2 235 ind m(-2)) and Cunaxiinae (H=887 ind m(-2); S = 1 936 ind
   m(-2)). The genus Pulaeus had the most species, and all were new to
   science. Mean and variance indicate an aggregate distribution for these
   cunaxids. By permanency and relative abundance, the dominant species
   were: Cunaxa potchensis, Coleoscirus simplex, Armascirus harrisoni,
   Cunaxoides sp. nov. 1, Cunaxoides sp. nov. 2, Pulaeus sp. nov. 15 and
   Pulaeus sp. nov. 16. An significant effect of the month and the biotope
   were recorded on the diversity and composition of cunaxid communities.
   Most of the species presented a significant effect of the month (24
   spp.) and biotope (23 spp,), and five species only had a significant
   effect of the watersheds. The highest similarity was in litter (75 \%)
   and soil (74 \%). The highest temporal variation in density, diversity
   and species richness was from April through June in litter, and from
   September through November in soil. The evenness was constant in both
   biotopes. In the dry period the soil presented higher values of density,
   while in the litter it was in the rainy season, The species with high
   soil density (February-June: dry season) in both watersheds, were: C,
   simple, C potchensis, Cunaxa sp. nov. 1, Cunaxa sp. nov. 2, C.
   veracruzana, Dactyloscirus sp. nov. 2, A. harrisoni, Cunaxoides sp. nov.
   1, Cunaxoides sp. nov. 2, P. pectinatus. Pulaeus sp. nov. 14, Pulaeus
   sp. nov. 15 and Pulaeus sp. nov. 16. They were the most representative
   species in the soil and litter of Chamela communities. The most abundant
   dry season species were C. potchensis in the soil and A. harrisoni in
   the litter.},

Abstract = {To assess the health status of aquatic ecosystems, specialized tools and
   strategies are needed to study the changes induced in oceanic systems by
   human activity. The Gulf of Mexico has a tremendous ecological
   importance because of its biological diversity. The present paper
   defines baseline levels of blood metabolites and immune components for
   wild tropical populations of F. duorarum: an important shrimp species of
   the Gulf of Mexico. Osmotic pressure (OP), osmotic capability (OC), oxy
   hemocyanin (OxyHc), glucose, digestive gland glycogen, proteins,
   cholesterol, lactate, acylglycerols (AG) were used as indicators of
   physiological and nutritional status; phenoloxidase activity,
   quantification of hemocytes, as well as respiratory burst, were used to
   assess the immunological status. There were no differences between sexes
   in either live weight or physiological and nutritional conditions. Only
   total blood protein, oxy hemocyanin, and digestive gland glycogen showed
   normally distributed data. All the remaining blood parameters were
   right- or left-skewed. A median live weight of 9.5 g was registered for
   the sampled population. Median values of 955 and -91.85 mOsm/kg (OP and
   OC, respectively) were obtained, indicating that shrimp were slightly
   hypo-osmotic in relation to sea water. A proportion of 27\% of OxyHc of
   the total protein (OxyHc/Prot) was calculated for the F. duorarum
   population. ProPO and PO showed no normal distribution and were not
   different between sexes. A right-skewed distribution was observed. Total
   hemocytes, hyaline (HC) and granular cells (GC) showed differences
   between sexes, with higher values in females than males. A similar
   proportion of HC (69\%) and GC (30\%) of total cells were observed
   between sexes. Basal and activated respiratory burst showed differences
   between sexes with higher values for females than for males. The current
   results provide indicators of the nutritional and immune status of F.
   duorarum that can be used to detect changes in trophic relations and
   health at a population level.},

Abstract = {The nervous system developmental programs proceed in orderly fashion
   following strict timetables. However, the mechanisms regulating
   developmental timing remain largely unknown.
   Increases or decreases in glucocorticoids in the fetal brain can be
   detrimental. We present evidence supporting that corticosterone forwards
   the migration of cerebellar granule neurons when applied acutely during
   pregnancy. This change in developmental tempo enhances dendritic growth
   of Purkinje neurons, increases the nuclear area, accelerates
   perinucleolar rosette appearance and decreases the development of Nissl
   bodies. Our observations thus support that forwarding the occurrence of
   developmental events does not always arrest neuronal growth, as some
   heterochronic developmental models imply. We suggest that prenatal
   glucocorticoids alter the trajectory of Purkinje neurons development
   soon after birth. These changes could represent a transient condition or
   could produce medium or long-term later consequences. More studies are
   needed to evaluate these intriguing possibilities.},

Title = {A phylogenetic hot spot for evolutionary novelty in middle American
   treefrogs},

Abstract = {Among the various types of evolutionary changes in morphology, the
   origin of novel structures may be the most rare and intriguing. Here we
   show statistically that the origins of different novel structures may be
   correlated and phylogenetically clustered into ``hot spots{''} of
   evolutionary novelty, in a case study involving skull elements in
   treefrogs. We reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within a clade of
   Middle American treefrogs based on data from 10 nuclear and four
   mitochondrial genes and then analyze morphological evolution across this
   tree. New cranial elements are rare among anurans and tetrapods in
   general, but three novel elements have evolved within this clade, with a
   40\% increase in the number of skull roof elements in some species. Two
   of these elements also evolved in a related clade of treefrogs, and
   these two novel elements may have each evolved repeatedly within one or
   both clades. The molecular phylogeny suggests striking homoplasy in
   cranial morphology and shows that parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the
   morphological data have produced misleading results with strong
   statistical support. The origins of the novel elements are associated
   with an overall increase in the ossification of dermal skull roof
   elements (suggesting peramorphosis) and with the evolution of a novel
   adaptive behavior. Our study may be the first to statistically document
   significant phylogenetic clustering and correlation in the origins of
   novel structures, and to demonstrate the strongly misleading effects of
   peramorphosis on phylogenetic analysis.},

Title = {Seasonal variations in sexual behavior, testosterone, testicular size

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of day length on
   seminal characteristics, testicular size, sexual behavior and
   testosterone concentration (T4) in dominant and subordinate Pelibuey
   rams. Six groups of three animals were evaluated every 2 weeks over a 12
   month period. Dominant (D), medium (M) and subordinate (S) animals in
   each group were identified through a food competition test every 15
   days. All rams ejaculated and produced semen throughout the year. A
   linear hierarchy was clearly established and maintained during the year.
   S rams had lower levels (P < 0.05) of semen volume, sperm concentration
   and testicular volume than D rams, regardless of season. Scrotal
   circumference was not influenced (P > 0.05) by their social position. D
   rams were more affected by the photoperiod, decreasing (P < 0.05)
   reaction times, increasing (P < 0.05) T-4 and producing more (P < 0.05)
   sperm per ejaculation than S rams during short days (14.65 +/- 1.22 vs
   26.92 +/- 1.65 s; 8.68 +/- 0.44 vs 7.37 +/- 0.40 ng/mL and 3.37 +/- 0.17
   vs 2.04 +/- 0.16 sperm/10(9), respectively). Semen volume and sperm
   concentration were significantly (P < 0.05) greater during short days in
   all rams, regardless of their social status, with the exception of sperm
   concentration in D rams where no variation was found. M rams displayed
   variable values in the range between the D and S rams. It was concluded
   that the magnitude of the seasonal effects was not sufficient to prevent
   the rams being used for breeding throughout the year and that seasonal
   variation within the variables affected the social ranks differently.},

Abstract = {Distributional patterns of 81 species of three genera of Mexican
   gymnosperms (Ceratozatnia, Dioon, Pinus) were analvzed to evaluate their
   contribution to the cladistic biogeography of the Mexican Transition
   Zone, applying Brooks Parsimony Analysis (BPA) and parsimony analysis of
   paralogy-free subtrees (PAPS). BPA showed three main groups of areas:
   clade A is corriprised of the Baja California, Great Basin, and Mojavean
   provinces; clade B includes the Valle de Tehuac6n-Cuicatl n, Balsas
   Basin, Planicie Costera del Noreste, Planicie Costera del Niloroeste.
   Costa del Golfo de M6xico, and Costa Pacifica provinces, located along
   the coasts and in the central lowlands of Mexico-, arid clade C includes
   the Appalachian, Atlantic and Gulf Coastal, Yucatan Peninsula,
   Caribbean, Californian, VanCOLIverian, Eastern Central America,
   Soconusco, Serranias Transistinicas, Serranias Meridionales, Sierra
   Madre Occidental, Altiplano, and Sierra Madre Oriental provinces,
   corresponding to the montane areas of the Mexican Transition Zone,
   Central America and some areas of the U.S.A. PAPS showed three groups of
   areas: clade D includes the Vancouverian, Appalachian, arid Atlantic and
   Gulf Coastal provinces; clade E the Balsas Basin, Planicie Costera del
   Noreste, and Planicie Costera del Noroeste provinces; arid clade F the
   Serranfas Transistrnicas, Socoriusco, Serranias Meridionales, Sierra
   Madre Occidental, Altiplano, Sierra Madre Oriental, Baja California,
   Californian, Great Basin and Mcjavean provinces. Comparing both
   analyses, three common area relationships ernerge: (1) Appalachian and
   Atlantic and Gulf Coastal provinces, (2) Great Basin, `Mojavean and Baja
   California provinces, and (3) Altiplano, Sierra Madre Oriental and
   Sierra Madre Occidental provinces. Differences between the general area
   cladograms can be accounted for by dispersal having a stronger influence
   in BPA, and the PAPS general area cladograrn showing a clearer vicariant
   signal. The aerieral area cladograrns obtained support some area
   relationships not explained in previous studies, and rriay complement
   the historical distributional patterns of the biota of the Mexican
   Transition Zone.},

Abstract = {The effect of a dry pelleted diet on growth of the Yucatan octopus
   (Octopus maya) was determined and compared with crab diet (Callinectes
   spp). Two groups of 15 wild collected animals were used. Octopuses were
   placed in isolation, in a flow-through system composed of 30 circular
   tanks ( 80 L), with a bottom of 40 cm in diameter and a water depth of
   80 cm. Experiment lasted 40 days, and octopuses were weighed every 10
   days to determine growth rates. Octopuses were fed between 7\% and 10\%
   body weight (BW) per day, twice a day at 9:00 h and 17:00 h. Uneaten
   food was removed after 4 h in the tanks and weighed, to determine food
   ingestion and conversion. No mortality as a result of natural causes was
   observed. The 15 octopuses fed on frozen crabs and the 15 fed on the
   artificial diet had similar weights (P > 0.05) at the start of the
   experiment, of 486.2 +/- 214.8 and 472.5 +/- 228.3 g, respectively. At
   the end of the experiment, octopuses fed on frozen crabs weighed 1466.5
   +/- 484.0 g, and were significantly larger (P < 0.05), than octopuses
   fed on artificial diets (438.9 +/- 202.6 g). Growth rates for the
   experiment were of 3.3 +/- 0.2 and -0.0 +/- 0.3\% BW per day, for
   octopuses fed frozen crabs and the artificial diet, respectively. The
   artificial diet did not promote growth, but animals did not loose weight
   and more important, ate regularly all the food supplied, with feeding
   rates higher than reported in the literature for prepared diets. This
   makes O. maya a good research animal for cephalopods.},

Abstract = {Absolute differential and total cross-sections for the production of H+
   and H-0 fragments in the energy range of 1-5 keV and scattering angles

   reported. The differential and total cross-sections for dissociative
   capture 2 (DC) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) were estimated.
   The differential cross-sections (DCS) of DC and CID for all acceleration
   energies show a monotonic decrease with increasing angle, showing an
   overall decrease of three and two orders of magnitude for DC and CID
   respectively. The total cross-section for the DC process is found to be
   in the range of 10.0-40.0 angstrom(2), while for the CID process it is
   between 0.8 and 2.3 angstrom(2). Both measured total cross-sections
   display a slowly increasing behavior as a function of the incident
   energy. The results show that the cross-section for the DC process is
   about 13.2 times higher in average than that for the CID process. (c)

Abstract = {The effect of the luteinizing hormone (LH) on the oogenesis of ovaries
   from newly-hatched chicks treated in vivo on days 13, 15, and 17 of
   embryonic development was analyzed. Changes in oogonial proliferation,
   meiotic prophase, degeneration of germ cells, and primordial follicular
   organization were determined. Results indicate that the total number of
   germ cells was not affected by the LH treatment, but significant
   differences existed in the number of oogonia and oocytes between the
   ovaries of control and LH-treated chicks. LH treatment increased the
   percentage of oocytes and diminished the percentage of oogonia. The
   mitotic activity of oogonia and degeneration of germ cells decreased,
   but the number of follicles during development increased in LH-treated
   ovaries. These findings suggest that LH treatment might trigger a
   cascade of endocrine events, resulting in inhibition of oogonial
   proliferation and induction of the meiotic prophase and follicle
   formation. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Freshwater Rhodophyta populations from high altitude streams
   (1,725-2,900 m a.s.l.) in the Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB), between 18-19
   degrees N and 96-100 degrees W, were investigated through the sampling
   of six stream segments from 1982 to 2006. Three species are documented,
   Batrachospermum gelatinosum, B. helminthosum and Sirodotia suecica,
   including their descriptions and physical and chemical water quality
   data from their environment. Batachospermum helminthosum and S. sitecica
   are reported for the second time in MVB streams, with a first
   description in detail for the freshwater red algal flora from Mexico.
   All species were found in tropical climates (two seasons along a year,
   dry and rainy), at high altitudes (> 1,700 m a.s.l.), mild water
   temperatures (9.0-20.4 degrees C), circumneutral (pH 6.0-8.2,
   bicarbonate as the dominant anion), and with a relative low ionic
   content (salinity 0.1 to 0.2 g l(-1), specific conductance 77-270 mu S
   cm(-1)). Two ecological groups of species were clearly distinguished on
   the basis of nutrient content. The first group, which includes B.
   helminthosum, is characterized by clean waters with low nutrient
   concentration, while the other, with B. gelatinosum and S. suecica,
   thrive surprisingly well in nutrient-rich waters. The overall species
   composition for streams in the MVB revealed strong similarities with
   freshwater red algal floras from other temperate regions in North
   America and other continents.},

Title = {Energy balance of Octopus maya fed crab or an artificial diet},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {152},
Number = {2},
Pages = {371-381},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of a natural prey
   (the crab Callinectes sp.) and an artificial diet (pellet with squid
   paste and offered as a paste) on the survival and assimilation
   efficiency of subadult octopuses with 486 g of initial live weight. In
   order to reach this goal, the effects of the type of diet on energetic
   balance were assessed by recording ingestion rate (C), respiratory rate
   (R = R routine, R (rout) + R apparent heat increment, R (AHI)), ammonia
   production rate (U = U routine, U (rout) + U post-prandial, U (PP)) and
   biomass production (P) of Octopus maya during its growing process.
   Energy lost from faeces (H) was calculated as H=C-(U+R+P) and
   assimilated energy (As) as R + P. Octopuses fed an artificial diet had
   almost five times higher ingestion rate compared to that observed in
   octopuses fed crab. However, growth rate and production (P) were high in
   octopuses fed crab in comparison to octopuses fed artificial diet. An
   inverse relation between faeces (H) and type of food was observed,
   indicating that animals lost 77\% of the ingested energy when fed
   artificial diet and only 5\% when fed crab. A higher assimilation and
   production efficiency were obtained in octopuses fed crab (P/As: 61\%)
   than in animals fed the artificial diet (P/As: -5\%). The routine O : N
   ratio for animals in fasting was 9.1 and 2.3 for octopuses being fed
   crabs and the artificial diet, respectively. The post-alimentary O : N
   ratio was 3.6 and 2.2 for animals fed crabs and the artificial diet,
   respectively. This indicates that animals fed on both diets rely almost
   exclusively on protein. Based on energy balance data, a value of 472 kJ
   week(1) kg(1) of live octopus was estimated as the energy needed to
   obtain a growth rate near 9 g day(1) (2.8\% BW day(1)) for O. maya
   subadults. The total crab biomass needed to obtain 1 kg of fed O. maya
   biomass was calculated. A comparison with other different energy balance
   measurements made in other octopus species indicates that O. maya and
   Enteroctopus megalocyathus (Perez et al. 2006) tend to be more efficient
   by channelling more ingested energy to biomass production (P = 69.5\% of
   C) than O. vulgaris (P = 23\% of C; Petza et al. 2006) or Paraledone
   charcoti (P = 4\% of C; Daly and Peck 2000).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {313-329},

Abstract = {A superdiffusive random-walk action in the depletion zone around a
   growing protein crystal is considered. It stands for a dynamic boundary
   condition of the growth process and competes steadily with a
   quasistatic, curvature-involving (thermodynamic) free boundary
   condition, both of them contributing to interpret the (mainly
   late-stage) growth process in terms of a prototype ion-channeling
   effect. An overall diffusion function contains quantitative signatures
   of both boundary conditions mentioned and indicates whether the new
   phase grows as an orderly phase or a converse scenario occurs. This
   situation can be treated in a quite versatile way both numerically and
   analytically, within a generalized Smoluchowski framework. This study
   can help in (1) elucidating some dynamic puzzles of a complex crystal
   formation vs biomolecular aggregation, also those concerning ion-channel
   formation, and (2) seeing how ion-channel-type dynamics of non-Markovian
   nature may set properly the pace of model (dis)ordered protein
   aggregation.},

Abstract = {The first reports of wild caught Australian redclaw crayfish from
   Mexico, in the states of Morelos and Tamaulipas, are presented. Redclaw
   crayfish were first brought to Mexico in 1995 to initiate experimental
   cultures at several research centers. In the following years a number of
   private ventures started commercial cultures, several of which in the
   states of Morelos and Tamaulipas are thought to have been the sources
   for the wild populations recorded in this study. The farms that acted as
   the original sources have not been operating for at least 2 years. In
   Morelos, high densities and all size classes of redclaws, including
   ovigerous females, were captured in natural waterways; whereas in
   Tamaulipas they were found at four sites occurring in irrigation canals
   in an agricultural district. The size attained by the wild redclaws, the
   abiotic conditions in which they were found and the potential for spread
   within the drainage systems of the Balsas and Tamesi Rivers are
   discussed.},

Title = {Local and circulating microchimerism is associated with hypersensitivity

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {176},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-95},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Rationale: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a lymphocytic alveolitis
   provoked by exposure to a variety of antigens. However, the disease
   occurs in only a subset of exposed individuals, suggesting that
   additional factors may be involved. Microchimerism has been implicated
   in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, especially in those showing
   increased incidence after childbearing age.
   Objectives: To evaluate the presence of circulating and local
   microchimeric cells in female patients with HP.
   Methods: Male microchimerism was examined in 103 patients with HP, 30
   with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and 43 healthy women. All of
   them had given birth to at least one son, with no twin siblings, blood
   transfusions, or transplants. Microchimerism was examined by dot blot
   hybridization (peripheral blood), and by fluorescence in situ
   hybridization in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and lungs.
   Measurements and Main Results: Blood microchimerism was found in 33\% of
   the patients with HP in comparison with 10\% in those with IPF (p =
   0.019) and 16\% in healthy women (p = 0.045). Patients with HP with
   microchimerism showed a significant reduction of diffusing capacity of
   carbon monoxide (DLCO; 53.5 +/- 11.9\% vs. 65.2 +/- 19.7\%; p = 0.02)
   compared with patients with HP without microchimerism. In
   bronchoalveolar lavage cells, microchimerism was detected in 9 of 14
   patients with HP compared with 2 of 10 patients with IPF (p 0.047). Cell
   sorting revealed that microchimeric cells were either macrophages or
   CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. Male microchimeric cells were also found in
   the five HP lungs examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
   Conclusions: Our findings (1) demonstrate that patients with HP exhibit
   increased frequency of fetal microchimerism, (2) confirm the
   multilineage capacity of microchimeric cells, and (3) suggest that
   microchimeric cells may increase the severity of the disease.},

Title = {UBVRI photometry of stellar structures throughout the disk of the

Journal = {ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {134},
Number = {1},
Pages = {142-157},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We report new detailed surface U, B, V, R, and I photometry of 81
   stellar structures in the disk of the barred galaxy NGC 3367. The images
   show many different structures, indicating that star formation is going
   on in most parts of the disk. NGC 3367 is known to have a very high
   concentration of molecular gas distribution in the central regions of
   the galaxy and bipolar synchrotron emission from the nucleus, with two
   lobes (at 6 kpc) forming a triple structure similar to a radio galaxy.
   We have determined the U, B, V, R, and I magnitudes and U - B, B - V, U
   - V, and V - I colors for the central region (nucleus), a region which
   includes supernova 2003 AA, and 79 star associations throughout NGC
   3367. The estimation of ages of star associations is very difficult due
   to several factors, among them the filling factor, metallicity, spatial
   distribution of each structure, and the fact that we estimated the
   magnitudes with a circular aperture of 16 pixels in diameter, equivalent
   to 6.8{''} similar to 1.4 kpc. However, even though the colors derived
   for NGC 3367 were similar to the colors expected of star clusters with
   theoretical evolutionary star tracks developed for the LMC and had a
   similar metallicity, NGC 3367 shows 56\% of the observed structures with
   age type SWB I (a few tens of megayears), with seven sources outside the
   high surface brightness visible disk.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {We discuss an operator solution for the bound states of the
   non-relativistic hydrogen atom. The method adds the phase of a state and
   its associated operator to the set of variables of the system. The
   augmented set of operators is found to form a closed set of commutation
   relations thus comprising an operator Lie algebra. From these relations,
   the energy spectrum and bounded radial eigenfunctions are calculated.
   Our approach is analogous to the one employed to compute the angular
   momentum spectrum and eigenfunctions but with operators satisfying an
   su(1,1) Lie algebra instead of su(2). This method, with the same
   operator algebra and minor modifications, may be used to solve the Dirac
   relativistic hydrogen atom. (c) 2007 American Association of Physics

Journal = {AUK},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {124},
Number = {3},
Pages = {806-814},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {New specimens from Sinaloa, Mexico, as well as two older specimens, show
   that both adult and recently fledged Lucy's Warblers (Vermivora luciae)
   often move far south of their breeding grounds to molt in the tropical
   deciduous forests of northwestern Mexico. Remarkably, the first
   preformative (= first prebasic) molt is complete in Lucy's Warblers,
   including the replacement of flight feathers, primary coverts, and
   rectrices; thus, previous aging criteria based on the wear and
   appearance of these feathers are invalid. We suggest that the recent
   conclusion that Lucy's Warblers molt on their breeding grounds (Voelker
   and McFarland 2002) is an artifact of more collecting in the
   southwestern United States than in western Mexico during late summer. An
   index of relative collecting in Mexico and the United States, as well as
   data from constant-effort mist netting, suggest that most Lucy's
   Warblers move south to molt.},

   against the exact case of the Moshinsky absorbing (and reflecting)

   contains seven species, T. calamarina, Tantilla cascadae, Tantilla
   coronadoi, Tantilla deppei, Tantilla sertula, Tantilla vermiformis, and
   the new species described herein. Collectively, members of the group are
   distributed along the Pacific versant of Middle America in three
   disjunct regions: (1) from northern Sinaloa to Guerrero, including the
   Tres Marias Islands; (2) the Balsas Basin of Morelos, Puebla, Distrito
   Federal, and the State of Mexico; and (3) from El Salvador to
   northwestern Costa Rica. We provide a small list of specimens collected
   in the highlands of Nayarit, and report Lithobates psilonota, Ambystoma
   rosaceum, Elgaria kingi, Plestiodon lynxe and Rhadinaea hesperia for the
   first time from the state. We report the second specimen of T. sertula,

Abstract = {An analysis of the distribution patterns of 124 Mexican gymnosperm
   species was undertaken, in order to detect the Mexican areas with high
   species richness and endemism, and with this information to propose
   areas for conservation. Our study includes an analysis of species
   richness, endemism and distributional patterns of Mexican species of
   gymnosperms based on three different area units (states, biogeographic
   provinces and grid-cells of 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude/longitude).
   The richest areas in species and endemism do not coincide; in this way,
   the Sierra Madre Oriental province, the state of Veracruz and a
   grid-cell located in the state of Oaxaca were the areas with the highest
   number of species, whereas the Golfo de Mexico province, the state of
   Chiapas and a grid-cell located in this state were the richest areas in
   endemic species. A weighted endemism and corrected weighted endemism
   indices were calculated, and those grid-cells with high values in both
   indices and with high species richness were considered as hotspots;
   these grid-cells are mainly located in Southern and Central Mexico.},

Title = {Does the Trans-mexican Volcanic Belt represent a natural biogeographical
   unit? An analysis of the distributional patterns of Coleoptera},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim We analysed the geographical distribution of beetle species of the
   families Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Dryophthoridae, Melolonthidae,
   Passalidae and Staphylinidae from the Trans-mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB)
   through a track analysis and a parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE),
   in order to test its naturalness and determine its affinities.
   Location The area analysed corresponds to the TVB, which is a
   biogeographical province of the Mexican Transition Zone.
   Methods The panbiogeographical analysis was based on the comparison of
   the individual tracks of 299 species of Buprestidae, Cerambycidae,
   Dryophthoridae, Melolonthidae, Passaliclae and Staphylinidae
   (Coleoptera). The TVB was divided into 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells
   and we also included in the analysis the remaining Mexican
   biogeographical provinces. Parsimony analysis of endemicity with
   progressive character elimination (PAE-PCE) was applied to classify
   areas by their shared taxa according to the most parsimonious
   cladograms. The nested sets of areas were represented as generalized
   tracks.
   Results Three generalized tracks were obtained: (1) grid cells 9C, 9D,
   10D, 10E, Sierra Madre Oriental, Chiapas, Mexican Gulf and the Sierra
   Madre del Sur; (2) grid cells 3B, 3C, 4B, 4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, Sierra Madre
   Occidental, Sierra Madre del Sur, Balsas Basin and the Mexican Pacific
   Coast, and (3) grid cells 8D, 9C, 9D, 10D, 10E, Yucatan Peninsula,
   Chiapas, Sierra Madre Oriental and the Mexican Gulf.
   Main conclusions We conclude that the TVB does not represent a natural
   biogeographical unit because it shows different relationships with other
   biogeographical provinces, being clearly transitional between the
   Nearctic and Neotropical provinces. Some parts of the TVB are related to
   Neotropical provinces (Chiapas, Mexican Gulf and Mexican Pacific Coast)
   and others to the remaining provinces of the Mexican Transition Zone
   (Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur, Sierra Madre Occidental
   and Balsas Basin).},

Abstract = {A renewed interest in Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) from nuclear
   physics laboratories is emerging in connection with Radioactive Ion
   Beams (RIBs). At the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at
   Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) we are exploring the AMS
   capabilities of the 25-MV tandem accelerator. Behind this effort is the
   realization that two fields of research - AMS and RIBs - complement each
   other in techniques. Development of effective and efficient beam
   purification techniques is of common interest to both AMS and the RIB
   program. Two main characteristics of the 25-MV tandem provide unique
   opportunities for performing the highest sensitivity measurements of
   AMS; namely (i) the highest operating voltage in the world, and (ii) a
   folded geometry which involves a 180 degrees magnet in the terminal. For
   the RIB program, we have used AMS techniques to improve the sensitivity
   of detection of some radioactive species in the measurement of unknown
   masses of n-rich nuclei. For AMS, we have concentrated in exploring two
   important isotopes, C-14 and Cl-36, for applications that require the
   highest sensitivity. We have successfully measured Cl-36/Cl ratios as
   low as a few times 10(-16) in seawater samples demonstrating that our
   setup has the highest sensitivity for this isotope and proving that
   Cl-36 can be measured at the levels required for a tracer in
   oceanography. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Biogeographical patterns of distribution Of 74 species of Asteraceae
   that inhabit mainly the temperate forests of eastern Mexico were studied
   using track analysis. Five generalized tracks were identified and
   conservation areas proposed based on degree of complexity of floristic
   patterns (Luna et al., 1999) and biotic richness. The northern part of
   the Sierra Madre Oriental harbours a high concentration of narrowly
   restricted species. In this area there are four track nodes that
   coincide with the Mexican priority terrestrial regions (RTPs) proposed
   by the Comision Nacional para el Concimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad
   (CONABIO) and with previously identified areas of importance for bird
   conservation (AICAs). Two more nodes are found in the central and
   southern part of the Sierra. With the gathered information, we propose
   particular selected species of Asteraceae to be included in the Mexican
   areas of endangered species (NOM).},

Abstract = {The macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of the epididymis of the
   sexually mature Peromyscus winkelmanni (Carleton) was examined using
   light and scanning electron microscopy. The epididymis was divided into
   three regions: caput, corpus and cauda. The epididymal duct was lined
   with columnar and cubic epithelium with stereocilia and covered by a
   muscular connective tissue sheath. Capillaries appear to penetrate
   directly into the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue in
   the initial segment. The epididymal epithelium presents four cell types:
   principal, basal, apical and clear cells. Based on morphological
   differences (height of epithelial cells, length of the stereocilia,
   luminal area, larger diameter and spermatic index), the epididymis of P.
   winkelmanni, presents seven zones. The stereocilia of the epididymal
   ducts of zones I, II, IV and V are thick and tall, while in zone III
   they are thin and short. The stereocilia in zone VI are thin, while in
   zone VII they are short but thick. The secretory products observed in
   the lumen of the epididymal ducts have vesicular, granular and fibrous
   form in the seven zones. This study contributes to an understanding of
   the morphofunctional features of the epididymis in sperm maturation in a
   species that shows seasonal reproductive activity.},

Abstract = {We add a phase variable and its corresponding operator to the
   description of the hydrogen atom. With the help of these additions, we
   device operators that act as ladder operators for the radial system. The
   algebra defined by the commutation relations between those operators has
   a Casimir operator coincident with the radial Hamiltonian of the
   problem. The algebra happens to be the well-known su(1,1) Lie algebra,

Abstract = {This study examined the feeding habits of three species of frugivorous
   bats in relation to their role as seed dispersers in two localities, one
   in a Neotropical rainforest area in the southern part of the Monies
   Azules Biosphere Reserve (REBIMA), and the other in Ejido Playon de la
   Gloria (PDLG). We estimated the relative abundance of Artibeus
   lituratus, Carollia perspicillata and Sturnira lilium. We determined the
   diversity and the successional category of fruits consumed by these
   species in both localities through the identification of seeds in their
   feces. The plant species diversity based on successional category showed
   that A. lituratus and C. perspicillata consume fruits of pioneer species
   as well as persistent species, while S. lilium only feeds on pioneer
   species. During the dry season A. lituratus and C. perspicillata had
   higher diversity and richness values of plant species consumed at
   REBIMA, whereas in the wet season they showed higher diversity and
   richness at PDLG, indicating that the diversity of seeds collected by
   both dispersers changes with the time of year. S. lilium presented
   higher diversity and richness values of plant species consumed at PDLG
   throughout the year study, indicating preference for fruits from early
   stages of plant succession.},

Title = {Accelerated Variant of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Clinical Behavior
   and Gene Expression Pattern},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Background. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the
   insidious onset of dyspnea or cough. However, a subset of patients has a
   short duration of symptoms with rapid progression to end-stage disease.
   In this study, we evaluated clinical and molecular features of ``rapid''
   and ``slow'' progressors with IPF. Methods and Findings. 26 patients
   with,6 months of symptoms before first presentation {[}rapid
   progressors] and 88 patients with >24 months of symptoms {[}slow
   progressors] were studied. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meyer
   method and proportional hazard's model. Lung microarrays and tissue
   proteins were measured in a subset of patients. No differences were
   found in age, physiologic impairment and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
   cellular profile. There were more males (OR = 6.5; CI: 1.4-29.5; p =
   0.006) and smokers (OR = 3.04; CI: 1.1-8.3; p = 0.04) in the rapid
   progressors group. Survival from the beginning of symptoms was
   significantly reduced in rapid progressors (HR = 9.0; CI: 4.48-18.3;
   p<0.0001) and there was a tendency for decreased survival from the time
   of diagnosis (HR = 1.5; CI: 0.81-2.87; p = 0.18). We identified 437
   differentially expressed genes. Lungs of rapid progressors overexpressed
   genes involved in morphogenesis, oxidative stress,
   migration/proliferation, and genes from fibroblasts/smooth muscle cells.
   Upregulation of two of these genes, adenosine-2B receptor and
   prominin-1/CD133, was validated by immunohistochemistry and were
   expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. BAL from rapid progressors
   showed a >2-fold increase of active matrix metalloproteinase-9, and
   induced a higher fibroblast migration compared with slow progressors and
   controls {[}238 +/- 98\% versus 123 +/- 29\% (p < 0.05) and 30 +/- 17\%
   (p < 0.01)]. Conclusions/Significance. A subgroup of IPF patients,
   predominantly smoking males, display an accelerated clinical course and
   have a gene expression pattern that is different from those with slower
   progression and longer survival. These findings highlight the
   variability in the progression of IPF, and may explain, in part, the
   difficulty in obtaining significant and reproducible results in studies
   of therapeutic interventions in patients with IPF.},

Abstract = {The rationale of this investigation was to examine the antinociceptive
   effect of an ethanol extract of Rosmarinus officinalis (RO) aerial
   parts, using three different experimental models: acetic acid-induced
   writhing test and formalin test in mice; and a model of arthritic pain:
   ``pain-induced functional impairment model in the rat (PIFIR model){''}.
   The antinociceptive efficacies were evaluated using several
   dose-response curves and time courses. The antinociceptive effects from
   RO extract were compared with the antinociceptive effect of either
   tramadol (TR: 3.16-50 mg/kg, i.p. in mice, and 1.0-31.62 mg/kg, i.p. in
   rats) or acetylsalicylic acid (AA: 31.62-562.32 mg/kg, p.o.). RO extract
   (10-300 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the number of
   writhing movement induced by the i.p. administration of acetic acid
   solution in a dose-dependent way (ED50 =108.84 mg/kg, whereas, TR showed
   an ED50 =12.38 mg/kg). In addition, RO extract (30-300 mg/kg)
   significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited licking and shaking behaviours in
   both early (neurogenic pain) and in the late (inflammatory pain) phases
   of the formalin test. These effects were like those produced by TR.
   Concerning the results using the PIFIR model, RO extract (30-3000 mg/kg,
   p.o.) like either TR or AA, produced a significant (P < 0.001) and
   dose-dependent antinociceptive response in rats (RO: ED50 = 222.78 mg/kg
   versus TR: ED50 = 11.06 mg/kg and AA: ED50 = 206.13 mg/kg). These
   results strongly suggest that aerial parts of RO possess antinociceptive
   and anti-inflammatory activity, and reinforce the use of this plant in
   folk medicine. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Analysis of the population dynamics of an endangered lizard

Abstract = {We conducted a demographic analysis from 2000 to 2004 of a population of
   the crevice-dwelling lizard, Xenosaurus grandis, in Veracruz, Mexico. We
   used population projection matrices to model its population dynamics.
   Three of the four annual matrices projected an actively growing
   population, whereas the matrix corresponding to 2003-2004 projected a
   declining population, apparently associated with a higher-than-average
   environmental temperature during this period. Observed population
   structure differed from that expected at equilibrium, according to the
   four matrices. Highest reproductive values corresponded to adult
   categories. The transition of newborns and juveniles to larger
   categories, as well as adult stasis, were the vital rates that made the
   largest contribution to population growth rate (lambda). Growth from one
   size class to the next was the demographic process that contributed the
   most to lambda, and all size classes had similar elasticities in all
   years. Stochastic simulations integrating interannual demographic
   variability projected population growth rates above unity, even under an
   ecological scenario that consisted of 50\% of unfavorable years. Despite
   this trend toward positive population growth, this X. grandis population
   faces an imminent threat due to the growing industrial development in
   the region in which it is endemic. Thus, we suggest this population as a
   primary target for conservation efforts, as well as a change in the
   conservation category of this species from ``special protection{''} to
   ``threatened.{''}},

Abstract = {A space is said to be \_21-homogeneous provided that there are exactly
   two orbits for the action of the group of homeomorphisms of the space
   onto itself. It is shown that if X is a 1/2-homogeneous continuum with
   at least one cut point, then X has either uncountably many cut points or
   only one cut point c. In the former case, X is 1/2-homogeneous if and
   only if X is an arc or X is a compactification of the reals R-1 whose
   remainder is the union of two disjoint, nondegenerate, homeomorphic
   homogeneous continua and the ends of X are mutually homeomorphic and
   1/3-homogeneous. In the latter case, the closures of the components of X
   - \{c\} are mutually homeomorphic and 2-homogeneous at c, and ord(c)(X)
   >= 4; furthermore, if ord(c)(X) <= omega, X is a locally connected
   bouquet of simple closed curves. Conversely, the two conditions about
   the components of X - \{c\} are shown to imply X is 1/2-homogeneous
   under an additional assumption, which is shown by examples to be both
   required and restrictive. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Adsorption isotherms of chloroorganic compounds on natural and
   dealuminated clinoptilolite zeolites, as well as on pure and Ag-doped
   microporous SiO2, were measured by a gas chromatography technique. The
   SiO2 microporous solids were synthesized by the sol-gel method from
   tetraethoxysilane and in the presence of methanol. Dealuminated
   clinoptilolite zeolites were obtained by means of HCl treatment of a
   natural precursor. Adsorption of chlorinated compounds (CxHyClz), such
   as chlorobenzene, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride, on SiO2,
   Ag-doped SiO2 and on the clinoptilolite zeolites was studied in the
   temperature range of 398-498 K. The Freundlich and Dubinin-Astakhov
   adsorption equations approximately fitted the CxHyClz adsorption data,
   within the selected temperature range. The energies of interaction
   between chlorinated adsorbates and microporous SiO2, Ag-doped SiO2, and
   clinoptilolite substrates were evaluated from the isosteric heats of
   adsorption (q(st)), which were found to obey the following decreasing
   order: q(st) (chlorobenzene) > q(st) (chloroform) > q(st) (carbon
   tetrachloride).},

Title = {Effects of the fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 on the
   sleep-wake cycle, c-Fos expression and dopamine levels of the rat},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {562},

Abstract = {Our group has described previously that the endogenous cannabinoid
   anandamide induces sleep. The hydrolysis of this lipid involves the
   activity of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which additionally
   catalyzes the degradation of the satiety factor oleoylethanolamide and
   the analgesic-inducing lipid palmitoylethanolamide. It has been
   demonstrated that the inhibition of the FAAH by URB597 increases levels
   of anandamide, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide in the brain
   of rats. In order to determinate the physiological properties of the
   FAAH inhibition on the sleep modulation, we report the pharmacological
   effects on the sleep-wake cycle of the rat after i.c.v. administrations
   of URB597, oleoylethanolamide or palmitoylethanolamide (10, 20 mu g/5 mu
   l). Separate unilateral i.c.v. injections of 3 compounds during the
   lights-on period, increased wakefulness and decreased slow wave (SW)
   sleep in rats in a dose-dependent fashion. We additionally found out
   that, compared to controls, c-Fos immunoreactivity in hypothalamus and
   dorsal raphe nucleus was increased in rats that received URB597,
   oleoylethanolamide or palmitoylethanolamide (10, 20 mu g/5 mu l,
   i.c.v.). Next, we found that after an injection of the compounds, levels
   of dopamine were increased whereas extracellular levels of levodopa
   (L-DOPA) were decreased. These findings indicate that that inhibition of
   the FAAH, via URB597, modulates waking. These effects were mimicked
   separately by the administration of oleoylethanolamide or
   palmitoylethanolamide. The alertness induced by the compounds tested
   here activated wake-promoting brain regions and they also induced the
   release of dopamine. Our results suggest that FAAH activity as well as
   two molecules that are catalyzed by this enzyme, oleoylethanolamide and
   palmitoylethanolamide, participate in the regulation of the waking
   state. Alternative approaches to treat sleep disorders such as excessive
   somnolence might consider the use of the URB597, oleoylethanolamide or
   palmitoylethanolamide since all compounds enhance waking. (c) 2007

Abstract = {This study was done in San Salvador and El Bondho, Mezquital valley,
   Hidalgo State, Mexico, with the aim of comparing the Collembola
   community from two plots with the same edaphic classification: San
   Salvador is irrigated with waste water (residual water) from Mexico
   City, and El Bondho, is watered from a well (sweet water). A total of
   5967 Collembola from 31 species were obtained of which 19 are new
   records for Hidalgo State; 4833 specimens were from San Salvador and
   1134 from El Bondho. Their species richness was 29 and 19, respectively.
   Dominant species both in abundance and frequency were Proisotoma minuta,
   Cryptopygus thermophilus, Xenylla grisea and Hypogastrura essa at San
   Salvador. Diversity and evenness were higher there than in El Bondho; in
   addition the species richness was lower than at San Salvador; mainly due
   to the dominant species. Similarity coefficient shows a disturbance in
   the composition of the Collembola communities, with only 70\% of
   similarity among both plots. The irrigation type affects the density of
   some species like X. grisea, Folsomides parvulus, Cryptopygus ca.
   benhami, Pseudosinella octopunctata and C. thermophilus and composition
   in both plots while Lepidocyrtus violaceus, Pseudosinella violenta and
   Sphaeridia serrata are affected by irrigation kind and sampling date.
   Soil properties, such pH, EC, OM and exchangeable contents of cations
   (Mg2+, Na+) appear to affect the composition and abundance of the
   Collembola communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Insulin and `insulin-like' growth factors (IGFs) are known to regulate
   cell growth in eukaryotes by stimulating a signal transduction pathway
   that exerts translational control. Intermediate kinases of this pathway,
   target of rapamycin (TOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), have
   been reported in Arabidospsis thaliana and Zea mays. However, upstream
   signal inducers and downstream targets of the pathway are not well known
   in plants. The objective of this work is to inquire whether plant growth
   is regulated by a signal transduction pathway similar to the
   insulin/IGF-stimulated pathway in other metazoans. Insulin as well as
   Zea mays insulin-related peptide (ZmIGF), which is a maize, 20-kDa
   peptide fraction recognized by insulin antibody, were used as effectors
   to stimulate maize axes growth from germinating seeds. ZmIGF expression
   was identified in axes from germinating maize seeds and immunolocalized
   in the meristems of these tissues. Significant enhancement of specific
   de novo protein synthesis of the translational apparatus components was
   found in the stimulated axes. Reverse-transcription-polymerasechain
   reaction analysis of total and polysomal RNA pools in ZmIGF- or
   insulin-stimulated axes confirmed these data by revealing specific mRNA
   recruitment into polysomes. In addition, the same stimuli induced
   activation of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (ZmS6K) in germinating maize
   axes. All the above effects were inhibited by rapamycin, indicating that
   they depend on TOR activity. We conclude that a TOR-S6K signal
   transduction pathway is functional in maize germination, as that found
   for non-photosynthetic eukaryotes. The evolutionary implications of
   these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {We use the phase space position-velocity (x, v) to deal with the
   statistical properties of velocity dependent dynamical systems, like
   dissipative ones. Within this approach, we study the statistical
   properties of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators in a linear weak
   dissipative media. Using the Debye model of a crystal, we calculate at
   first order in the dissipative parameter the entropy, free energy,
   internal energy, equation of state and specific heat using the classical
   and quantum approaches. For the classical approach we found that the
   entropy, the equation of state, and the free energy depend on the
   dissipative parameter, but the internal energy and specific heat do not
   depend of it. For the quantum case, we found that all the
   thermodynamical quantities depend on this parameter.},

Title = {A phylogenetic perspective on elevational species richness patterns in
   Middle American treefrogs: Why so few species in lowland tropical
   rainforests?},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Differences in species richness at different elevations are widespread
   and important for conservation, but the causes of these patterns remain
   poorly understood. Here, we use a phylogenetic perspective to address
   the evolutionary and biogeographic processes that underlie elevational
   diversity patterns within a region. We focus on a diverse but
   well-studied fauna of tropical amphibians, the hylid frogs of Middle
   America. Middle American treefrogs show a ``hump-shaped{''} pattern of
   species richness (common in many organisms and regions), with the
   highest regional diversity at intermediate elevations. We reconstructed
   phylogenetic relationships among 138 species by combining new and
   published sequence data from 10 genes and then used this phylogeny to
   infer evolutionary rates and patterns. The high species richness of
   intermediate elevations seems to result from two factors. First, a
   tendency for montane clades to have higher rates of diversification.
   Second, the early colonization of montane regions, leaving less time for
   speciation to build up species richness in lowland regions (including
   tropical rainforests) that have been colonized more recently. This
   ``time-for-speciation{''} effect may explain many diversity patterns and
   has important implications for conservation. The results also imply that
   local-scale environmental factors alone may be insufficient to explain
   the high species richness of lowland tropical rainforests, and that
   diversification rates are lower in earth's most species-rich biome.},

Abstract = {Equisetum myriochaetum is a Mexican plant used in folk medicine to treat
   kidney diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The main constituents of
   the phytoextract are flavonol glycosides (kaempferol), phytoesterols and
   carbohydrates. In this study, phytotherapeutic extracts from Equisetum
   myriochaetum were investigated for genotoxicity in the in vivo wing spot
   test in Drosophila melanogaster and in the in vitro human micronucleus
   test. No acute toxicity of the phytoextract could be determined in
   Drosophila or in human lymphocytes in culture, ranging from 0.78 mu g/ml
   to 3700 mu g/ml for the wing assay and between 12.5 mu g/ml and 500 mu
   g/ml for the micronucleus test. The Drosophila wing somatic mutation and
   recombination test (SMART) was applied in the standard version with
   basal biotransformation activity as well as in a variant version with
   increased cytochrome P450-dependent bioactivation capacity. The ranges
   of exposure concentrations for these genotoxicity experiments were
   between 0.78 mu g/ml and 500 mu g/ml. The human micronucleus test in
   vitro was performed with cultured lymphocytes obtained from four healthy
   donors. The concentrations assayed for these experiments ranged from
   12.5 mu g/ml to 500 mu g/ml. No statistically significant increase was
   observed between treated series when compared with a concurrent negative
   (water solvent) control series in either assay. The results demonstrate
   clearly that the phytotherapeutic extract from Equisetum myriochaetum,
   under the experimental conditions tested, is not genotoxic in the in
   vivo experiments or in the in vitro studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {Plant cell walls undergo dynamic changes in response to different
   environmental stress conditions. In response to water deficit, two
   related proline-rich glycoproteins, called p33 and p36, accumulate in
   the soluble fraction of the cell walls in Phaseolus vulgaris
   (Covarrubias et al. in Plant Physiol 107:1119-1128, 1995). In this work,
   we show that p33 and p36 are able to form a 240 kDa oligomer, which is
   found in the cell wall soluble fraction. We present evidence indicating
   that the highest accumulation of these proteins in response to water
   deficit occurs in the growing regions of common bean seedlings,
   particularly in the phloem tissues. These proteins were detected in P.
   vulgaris cell suspension cultures, where the p33/p36 ratio was higher
   under hyperosmotic conditions than in bean seedlings subjected to the
   same treatment. The results support a role for these proteins during the
   plant cell response to changes in its water status, and suggest that
   cell wall modifications are induced in active growing cells of common
   bean in response to water limitation.},

Abstract = {Progesterone participates in the regulation of several functions in
   chicks such as ovulation, gonadal differentiation, and sexual and
   nesting behaviors. Many progesterone actions are mediated by specific
   intracellular receptors (PR) which are ligand-induced transactivators.
   Two PR isoforms that are functionally distinct in their ability to
   activate genes and regulate distinct physiological processes have been
   described in chicks: a full length form PR-B and the N-terminally
   truncated one PR-A which lacks the amino-terminal 128 amino acids of
   PR-B. PR isoforms have been detected in several tissues of both the
   adult and the embryo chick such as brain, ovary and oviduct. PR isoforms
   expression ratio varies among progesterone target tissues and under
   different hormonal and environmental conditions such as those presented
   during avian sexual maturity and the seasons of the year. These data let
   us to conclude that progesterone actions in brain, ovary, and oviduct
   highly depend on PR isoforns expression pattern and regulation. (c) 2006

Abstract = {The rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), is a salmoniform
   fish that spawns once per year. Ripe females that had ovulated
   naturally, and those induced to ovulate using salmon
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone, were studied to determine whether
   follicles were forming at the time of spawning and to describe the
   process of folliculogenesis. After ovulation, the ovaries of postspawned
   rainbow trout were examined histologically, using the periodic
   acid-Schiff procedure, to stain basement membranes that subtend the
   germinal epithelium and to interpret and define the activity of the
   germinal epithelium. After spawning, the ovary contained a few ripe
   oocytes that did not ovulate, numerous primary growth oocytes including
   oocytes with cortical alveoli, and postavulatory follicles. The germinal
   epithelium was active in postspawned rainbow trout, as determined by the
   presence of numerous cell nests, composed of oogonia, mitotic oogonia,
   early diplotene oocytes, and prefollicle cells. Cell nests were
   separated from the stroma by a basement membrane continuous with that
   subtending the germinal epithelium. Furthermore, follicles containing
   primary growth oocytes were connected to the germinal epithelium; the
   basement membrane surrounding the follicle joined that of the germinal
   epithelium. After ovulation, the basement membrane of the postovulatory
   follicle was continuous with that of the germinal epithelium. We
   observed consistent separation of the follicle, composed of. an oocyte
   and surrounding follicle cells, from the ovarian stroma by a basement
   membrane. The follicle is derived from the germinal epithelium. As with
   the germinal epithelium, follicle cells derived from it never contact
   those of the connective tissue stroma. As with epithelia, they are
   always separated from connective tissue by a basement membrane.},

Abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that in Montezuma swordtail Xiphophorus
   montezumae, bearers of longer swords would face higher costs in terms of
   swimming speed than males with shorter swords, as a result of
   differences in total body length when natural swords were present.
   Variation in natural sword length, however, did not appear to be
   correlated with the cost in terms of critical swimming speed, U-crit. On
   the other hand, the mean U-crit of males with the sword excised was 21\%
   higher than that when natural sword was present. This study suggests
   that the sword of Montezuma swordtail represents a disadvantage in terms
   of swimming performance regardless of the differences in sword length.},

Abstract = {Adult lizards (Sceloporus torquatus) were used to test whether seasonal
   differences in the effects of pinealectomy upon the locomotor activity
   rhythm exist. Animals were field collected and exposed to artificial
   light-dark cycles and constant temperature in winter and summer. Free
   running circadian rhythms under constant temperature and dim red light
   were monitored using infrared light-crossings. The effects of
   pinealectomy were assessed by analysing the circadian parameters of free
   running period and activity -rest ratio in constant darkness or light
   -dark cycles. Results obtained indicate that pinealectomy changes the
   free running period of locomotor activity rhythm, irrespective of
   season, while seasonal differences in activity-rest ratio were detected.
   Our findings support the hypothesis that seasonal regulation of
   circadian rhythms in lizards is accomplished, in part, via the output of
   the pineal gland.},

Title = {Seed anatomy and water uptake in relation to seed dormancy in Opuntia
   tomentosa (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae)},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BOTANY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {99},
Number = {4},
Pages = {581-592},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background and Aims There is considerable confusion in the literature
   concerning impermeability of seeds with `hard' seed coats, because the
   ability to take up (imbibe) water has not been tested in most of them.
   Seeds of Opuntia tomentosa were reported recently to have a
   water-impermeable seed coat sensu lato (i.e. physical dormancy), in
   combination with physiological dormancy. However, physical dormancy is
   not known to occur in Cactaceae. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
   determine if seeds of O. tomentosa are water-permeable or
   water-impermeable, i.e. if they have physical dormancy.
   Methods The micromorphology of the seed coat and associated structures
   were characterized by SEM and light microscopy. Permeability of the
   seed-covering layers was assessed by an increase in mass of seeds on a
   wet substrate and by dye-tracking and uptake of tritiated water by
   intact versus scarified seeds.
   Key Results A germination valve and a water channel are formed in the
   hilum-micropyle region during dehydration and ageing in seeds of O.
   tomentosa. The funicular envelope undoubtedly plays a role in
   germination of Opuntia seeds via restriction of water uptake and
   mechanical resistance to expansion of the embryo. However, seeds do not
   exhibit any of three features characteristic of those with physical
   dormancy. Thus, they do not have a water-impermeable layer(s) of
   palisade cells (macrosclereids) or a water gap sensu stricto and they
   imbibe water without the seed coat being disrupted.
   Conclusions Although dormancy in seeds of this species can be broken by
   scarification, they have physiological dormancy only. Further, based on
   information in the literature, it is concluded that it is unlikely that
   any species of Opuntia has physical dormancy. This is the first
   integrative study of the anatomy, dynamics of water uptake and dormancy
   in seeds of Cactaceae subfamily Opuntioideae.},

Title = {Relations between PM10 composition and cell toxicity:: A

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1218-1228},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Previous studies have used particle mass and size as metrics to link
   airborne particles with deleterious health effects. Recent evidence
   suggests that particle composition can play an important role in
   PM-toxicity; however, little is known about the specific participation
   of components (individually or acting in groups) present in such a
   complex mixture that accounts for toxicity. This work explores
   relationships among PM10 components in order to identify their covariant
   structure and how they vary in three sites in Mexico City. Relationships
   between PM10 with cell toxicity and geographical location were also
   explored. PM10 was analyzed for elemental composition, organic and
   elemental carbon, endotoxins and the induction of inhibition of cell
   proliferation, IL-6, TNF alpha and p53. PM10 variables were evaluated
   with principal component analysis and one-way ANOVA. The inhibition of
   cell proliferation, IL-6 and TNF alpha were evaluated with factorial
   ANOVA and p53 with the Welch test. The results indicate that there is
   heterogeneity in particle mass, composition and toxicity in samples
   collected at different sites. Multivariate analysis identified three
   major groups: (1) S/K/Ca/Ti/Mn/Fe/Zn/Pb; (2) Cl/ Cr/Ni/Cu; and (3)
   endotoxins, organic and elemental carbon. Groups 1 and 3 showed
   significant differences among sites. Factorial ANOVA modeling indicated
   that cell proliferation was affected by PM concentration; TNF alpha and
   IL-6 by the interaction of concentration and site, and p53 was different
   by site. Radial plots suggest the existence of complex interactions
   between components, resulting in characteristic patterns of toxicity by
   site. We conclude that interactions of PM10 components determine
   specific cellular outcomes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Mexican Transition Zone, one is Situated in the Mexican Transition Zone,
   and one is shared by the Nearctic region and the Mexican Transition
   Zone. Eight nodes were found in the intersection of these generalized
   tracks, five of them located in the Neotropical region and three in the
   Mexican Transition Zone. Distributional patterns of Mexican Cerambycidae
   show two basic patterns: one mostly Neotropical, in the Mesoamerican
   dominion (Mexican Pacific Coast and Mexican Gulf biogeographic
   provinces) and another in the Mexican Transition Zone (Transmexican
   Volcanic Belt and Balsas Basin biogeographic provinces).},

Abstract = {We analyzed the avifaunas of the Caribbean islands and nearby
   continental areas and their relationships using Parsimony Analysis of
   Endemicity (PAE), in order to assess biogeographical patterns and their
   concordance with geological and phylogenetic evidence. Using
   distributional information of birds obtained from published literature,
   a presence/absence matrix for 695 genera and 2026 species of land and
   freshwater birds was constructed and analyzed. Three different analyses
   were performed: for species, for genera, and for species and genera
   combined. In the combined analysis, the Lesser Antilles appear
   paraphyletic at the base of the cladogram. Then, two major clades are
   identified: South America (Andes, Venezuelan lowlands, Dutch West Indies
   and Trinidad and Tobago) and North America, including the Greater
   Antilles in a clade that is the sister area to Yucatan and the Central
   American countries nested from north to south. PAE results support
   Caribbean vicariant models and cladistic biogeographical hypotheses on
   area relationships, and show relative congruence with available
   phylogenetic data. Bird biogeography on the Caribbean islands appears to
   have been caused by both vicariance and dispersal processes. (c) The

Abstract = {Mathematical models for the population dynamics of de novo resistant
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis within individuals are studied. The models
   address the use of one or two antimicrobial drugs for treating latent
   tuberculosis (TB). They consider the effect of varying individual immune
   response strength on the dynamics for the appearance of resistant
   bacteria. From the analysis of the models, equilibria and local
   stabilities are determined. For assessing temporal dynamics and global
   stability for sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria, numerical
   simulations are used. Results indicate that for a low bacteria load that
   is characteristic of latent TB and for small reduction in an immune
   response, the use of a single drug is capable of curing the infection
   before the appearance of drug resistance. However, for severe immune
   deficiency, the use of two drugs will provide a larger time period
   before the emergence of resistance. Therefore, in this case, two-drugs
   treatment will be more efficient in controlling the infection.},

Title = {Identification of the benign mesenchymal tumor gene HMGA2 in

Journal = {CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1902-1909},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The normal expression pattern of HMGA2, an architectural transcription
   factor, is primarily restricted to cells of the developing mesenchyme
   before their overt differentiation during organogenesis. A detailed in
   situ hybridization analysis showed that the undifferentiated mesoderm of
   the embryonic lung expressed Hmga2 but it was not expressed in the
   newborn or adult lung. Previously, HMGA2 was shown to be misexpressed in
   a number of benign, differentiated mesenchymal tumors including lipomas,
   uterine leiomyomas, and pulmonary chondroid hamartomas. Here, we show
   that HMGA2 is misexpressed in pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM), a
   severe disorder of unknown etiology consisting of lymphatic smooth
   muscle cell proliferation that results in the obstruction of airways,
   lymphatics, and vessels. Immunohistochemistry was done with antibodies
   to HMGA2 and revealed expression in lung tissue samples obtained from 21
   patients with LAM. In contrast, HMGA2 was not expressed in sections of
   normal adult lung or other proliferative interstitial lung diseases,
   indicating that the expression of HMGA2 in LAM represents aberrant gene
   activation and is not due solely to an increase in cellular
   proliferation. In vivo studies in transgenic mice show that
   misexpression of HMGA2 in smooth muscle cells resulted in increased
   proliferation of these cells in the lung surrounding the epithelial
   cells. Therefore, similar to the other mesenchymal neoplasms, HMGA2
   misexpression in the smooth muscle cell leads to abnormal proliferation
   and LAM tumorigenesis. These results suggest that HMGA2 plays a central
   role in the pathogenesis of LAM and is a potential candidate as a
   therapeutic target.},

Abstract = {Areas of endemism of Mexican terrestrial mammals using ecological niche
   modeling projected as species' potential distributions were identified
   to compare its performance with a previous analysis that used point
   occurrence data, and to incorporate Goloboff fit to Parsimony Analysis
   of Endemicity (PAE) for improving identification of areas of endemism.
   Six PAE were performed, combined or not, with Goloboff fit (k=0 and 2)
   using species' potential distributions of 429 terrestrial mammals
   overlaid on 248 by 232 quadrats of 1 degrees latitude-longitude
   countrywide. Consistency (CI) and retention (RI) indices were used for
   identifying endemic, characteristic, and possibly endemic species. Based
   on the strict consensus cladogram with k=0, seven areas of endemism
   defined by two or more species were identified: the Mexican Plateau, the
   Baja California Peninsula (with a nested pattern of endemism in the
   south and north), Chiapas (with a nested pattern of endemism in the
   south and north), the Mexican Pacific Coast, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,
   the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Yucatan Peninsula. PAE cladograms
   using species' potential distributions showed a better resolution than
   those produced using point occurrence data, showing consensus with fewer
   number of steps and higher number of synapomorphies. Goloboff fit (k)
   allowed individual down-weighting of ``noisy{''} species, thus
   increasing the number of synapomorphies in the cladograms, and even
   identifing more areas of endemism. Cladograms with k=0 had the largest
   number of synapomorphies, whereas k=2 allowed to obtain a smaller number
   of cladograms.},

   However, unexpected transient stationary spherical waves are also

   striking contrast with the similar 1D problem, the angular momentum
   generates unexpected transient stationary spherical waves which have
   their main contribution at points inside the sphere but only for very

Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {410-426},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In order to understand the rise of runaway solutions in the radiation
   reaction problem a mechanical model is used. An alternative
   demonstration of Daboul's theorem, through Hurwitz's criterion, is
   given. The origin of runaway solutions in electrodynamics is discussed.
   They arise when the particle has a negative mechanical mass or when
   approximations are used in the equation of motion. In the 1-dimensional
   mechanical model an exact and linear equation of motion for the particle
   is obtained, the corresponding exact solution is again runaway when the
   mechanical mass is negative. The exact solution is not runaway when the
   mechanical mass is positive. However, the use of approximations leads to
   an equation of motion which has runaway solutions. It is exhibited that
   the use of approximations in the 3-dimensional mechanical model is
   completely necessary because the general equation of motion for the
   particle is non-linear. The analysis of this case proceeds in a very
   similar way to the one carried out in electrodynamics. This means that
   the number of dimensions also plays an important role in the analysis.},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {A scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed for 570 quartz
   grains from desert and coastal dune sands in NW Mexico. Our main goal is
   to present a new application in the use of ternary diagrams with
   logistic normal confidence region boundaries of normalized data based on
   quartz surface textures (i.e., constrained data) of desert and coastal
   dune sands. This was done to demonstrate that quartz surface textures
   from desert and coastal dune sands are not significantly different even
   though there are apparent dominant processes (mechanical, chemical) that
   produce different surface textures in quartz grains from both dune
   types. This may be associated with the fact that quartz grains deposited
   in the dune sands do not reflect a second cycle of transport associated
   with an aeolian environment because of their low textural maturity,
   provenance, closeness to the source rock, and little attrition process.
   This study indicates that quartz grains from the desert dunes display
   mechanical textures probably associated with the Colorado River Delta
   and granitic sources that do not reflect accurately the aeolian
   mechanisms controlling the transport of these grains. Also, some quartz
   grains display chemical surface textures probably linked to the
   hydrothermal activity near the Colorado River Delta. In general, quartz
   grains display conspicuous surface textures. Quartz from coastal dune
   sands displays chemical surface textures that indicate quartz
   precipitation from silica-saturated water and, to a lesser extent, it
   displays mechanical features. These similarities might be associated
   with the mixing of processes (mechanical, chemical) in quartz from the

Abstract = {The arboreal mice of the genus Habromys (Rodentia: Cricetidae:
   Neotominae) are among the most poorly known Neotropical rodents. We
   investigated species-level phylogenetic relationships among the seven
   described Habromys species using 1331 aligned bases from the
   mitochondrial ND3 and ND4 regions. Sequences were obtained from 30
   specimens of the seven known species of Habromys and we performed
   maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian probabilities
   analyses. The monophyly of the genus Habromys within the Neotomines was
   verified. The northernmost H. simulatus is sister to the remaining
   species of the group; within the latter, the southernmost clade (Oaxaca
   to Central America) is sister to the Transmexican Volcanic Belt clade.
   Four major clades are clearly distinguished: H. simulatus from the
   Sierra Madre Oriental and the closely associated Sierra Mazateca; H.
   delicatulus and H. schmidlyi from the Transmexican Volcanic Belt; H.
   lepturus, H. chinanteco, and H. ixtlani from the northern Oaxacan
   highlands; and H. lophurus from Nuclear Central America. Within species,
   the analyses suggest that H. simulatus and H. lophurus are each composed
   by two different taxa. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Different sources of information about biodiversity may lead to
   unrealistic or biased estimation of its components, with different
   patterns according to the scale of analysis. In this study, we analyse
   patterns of species richness at the local (average alpha) and regional
   (gamma) scales, and the relationship between them (Whittaker's beta), in
   central Mexico, using as a source of data for the species'
   distributions: (1) museum specimen occurrence data for birds, and (2)
   distribution maps based on ecological niche models developed and refined
   by experts. We performed analyses at five spatial resolutions (1/32
   degrees-1/2 degrees). Scale changes (grain and extent) affected
   significantly the estimates of average alpha, gamma, and beta. Use of
   raw occurrence data vs. distribution maps yielded contrasting results,
   with raw data underestimating alpha and overestimating beta, as
   functions of area. As regards species-area relationships, our results
   suggest a natural decomposition of factors into an area-invariant
   component (related to alpha), and an area dependent factor (related to
   beta). Most of our results are maintained in a null model that
   randomizes occurrences without changing observed range-size
   distributions. From this result we argue that average alpha and
   Whittaker's beta capture little information about the spatial
   covariation of species distribution patterns.},

Abstract = {To understand the population dynamics of a species, it is necessary to
   document the way in which its demographic behaviour varies through space
   and time. Anthropogenic disturbance, such as shifting cultivation, is an
   important factor causing demographic variation in many tropical
   non-timber forest products. The leaves of the palm Sabal yapa are an
   important non-timber forest product used for thatching by Mayan peoples.
   The demography of Sabal yapa was studied in three habitats (mature
   forest, successional forest and crop fields), representing successional
   phases along the slash-and-burn agricultural cycle in the Yucatan
   Peninsula. Matrix population models, along with elasticity analyses and
   life-table-response experiments were employed. Population growth rate
   differed between patches (MF: lambda = 1.043; SF: lambda = 1.027: CF:
   lambda = 0.959). Only the lambda value of the mature forest was
   significantly higher than unity. Fecundity and seedling survival were
   lowest in the crop fields and highest in the mature forest. The
   elasticity analyses and life-table-response experiments showed that
   entries with a high positive contribution to, also showed high
   elasticity values, while those with a negative contribution to lambda
   showed low elasticity. Thus, both analyses are crucial to understand the
   demography of a species and to aid in conservation and management
   practices.},

Abstract = {Progesterone participates in the regulation of several reproductive
   functions in birds through its interaction with intracellular
   progesterone receptors (PR) which exhibit two isoforms (PR-A and PR-B)
   with different function and regulation. We determined the content of PR
   isoforms in several brain regions of immature (1.5 months-old), mature
   (12 months-old) and aged (48 months-old) male and female chickens by
   Western blot analysis. PR isoforms protein content changed in tissue-and
   age-specific manner in the brain of both male and female chickens. In
   female animals PR-B content was higher in the hypothalamus of mature
   animals than in other ages while PR-A content increased in the
   cerebellum of aged animals. No significant changes were observed in PR
   isoforms content in the cortex and the tectum of female animals. In
   contrast, in male animals PR-B content was higher in the hypothalamus of
   aged animals. The cerebellum, tectum and cortex of male animals did not
   present significant changes in PR isoforms content. In all studied
   regions of female animals PR-B was the predominant isoform, whereas, in
   males a significant predominance of PR-B was only found in the
   hypothalamus of aged animals. These results demonstrate that PR isoforms
   content presents a sexual dimorphism in the brain of chickens that
   changes in tissue-and age-specific manner, and suggest that these
   variations contribute to the regulation of progesterone actions in brain
   throughout the lifespan of male and female chickens. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Las Palmas lagoon is a part of the hydrographic system of
   Pom-Atasta-Puerto Rico, NE of Laguna de Terminos, southern Gulf of
   Mexico. Swimming crabs of the genus Callinectes abound in this area and
   play an important role in the complex trophic dynamics of the
   macrobenthos. We analysed the feeding habits of Callinectes rathbunae
   and its variations on three temporal scales. Sampling was carried out
   from August 1999 through July 2000, both on a monthly basis (9:00-13:00
   h) at new moon, and for each season (every 6 h during 24 h) with a small
   shrimp trawl net. Samples of epi- and infauna were simultaneously taken.
   The stomachs of all C. rathbunae collected were dissected and the
   dietary components identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible.
   Percentage frequency of occurrence (\%F) of each taxon was calculated,
   together with the normalized Levins index (Ba) for each (a) season, (b)
   size class (20 mm intervals), and (c) day- and night-time period in each
   season. While the trophic niche breadth of this species does not vary
   significantly with season, crab size, or time of day, diet components
   differed among seasons and crab size classes. Results indicate that
   ontogenic differences in the feeding strategies of this species
   contribute most importantly to overall variations in diet.},

Abstract = {We investigated the electronic structure of the RNiSn (R=La,Ce,Pr,Nd)
   intermetallic compounds as well as their corresponding mono- and
   dihydrides. We computed the energy bands and the total and partial
   densities of states using a mixed approach; a pseudopotential scheme and
   ab initio full potential-all electron band-structure techniques. The
   crystal structure was investigated for each of the 12 compounds by
   performing full geometry optimization. We determine the magnetic
   properties of these compounds. We also analyze the details of the
   bonding in these systems, in particular, the effect of the hydrogen
   insertion in the parent intermetallic compounds. We found that, besides
   the nonmagnetic reference systems LaNiSnHx, the Pr- and Nd-derived
   systems are consistent with f(+2) and f(+3) electronic configurations.
   The case of the Ce compounds, as expected, showed a more complicated
   situation; the computed magnetic moment suggests an intermediate valence
   state for CeNiSnH. The decomposition enthalpies for the mono- and
   dihydrides have been estimated and compared with experimental values for
   similar compounds.},

Title = {Bichromatic quadrangulations with Steiner points},
Journal = {GRAPHS AND COMBINATORICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {23},
Number = {S},
Pages = {85-98},
Abstract = {Let P be a k colored point set in general position, k >= 2. A family of
   quadrilaterals with disjoint interiors Q(1) , . . . , Q(m) is called a
   quadrangulation of P if V(Q(1))U. . . UV(Q(m)) = P, the edges of all
   Q(i) join points with different colors, and Q(1)U . . . UQ(m) = Conv(P).
   In general it is easy to see that not all k-colored point sets admit a
   quadrangulation; when they do, we call them quadrangulatable. For a
   point set to be quadrangulatable it must satisfy that its convex hull
   Conv(P) has an even number of points and that consecutive vertices of
   Conv(P) receive different colors. This will be assumed from now on. In
   this paper, we study the following type of questions: Let P be a
   k-colored point set. How many Steiner points in the interior of Conv(P)
   do we need to add to P to make it quadrangulatable? When k = 2, we
   usually call P a bichromatic point set, and its color classes are
   usually denoted by R and B, i.e. the red and blue elements of P. In this
   paper, we prove that any bichromatic point set P = R U B where vertical
   bar R vertical bar = vertical bar B vertical bar = n can be made
   quadrangulatable by adding at most {[}n-1/3] + {[}n/2] + 1 Steiner
   points and that m/3 Steiner points are occasionally necessary. To prove
   the latter, we also show that the convex hull of any monochromatic point
   set P of n elements can be always partitioned into a set S = \{S-1 , . .
   . , S-t\} of star-shaped polygons with disjoint interiors, where V(S-1)
   U . . . U V (S-t) = P, and t <= {[}n-1/3] + 1. For n = 3k this bound is
   tight. Finally, we prove that there are 3-colored point sets that cannot
   be completed to 3-quadrangulatable point sets.},

Title = {Saline acclimation of striped mojarra Eugerres plumieri (Cuvier

   spawning},

Abstract = {The main objective of the current study was to determine an optimal
   dosage of commercial carp pituitary extract (CPE) of the conventional
   heteroplastic hypophysation technique to induce spawning in the wild
   caught striped mojarra broodstock Eugerres plumieri under laboratory
   conditions. We also describe trials testing saline acclimation regimes
   (changes from 10 parts per thousand to 30 parts per thousand) prior to
   hormonal induction. For saline acclimation, three treatments were
   performed: first and second treatments began 1-day after conditioning of
   broodstock fish with a total duration of the saline changes lasting
   1-day and 2-days, respectively. The third treatment began 30-days after
   conditioning with a 7-day saline regime. After reaching 30 parts per
   thousand, all fish from the first and second treatments died after the
   fourth and ninth days, respectively; while the fishes in the third
   treatment survived more than two years. These fish remain on public
   exhibit in the ``Mundo Marino{''} Aquarium, Santa Marta, Colombia. Four
   treatments of hormonal induction were tested on females using a total
   concentration of 5-mg of CPE per kg of body weight: first, second and
   third treatments were applied in two hormonal doses that corresponded to
   10\%-90\%, 30\%-70\% and 40\%-60\%, respectively, with time intervals
   between doses of 14-h for the first and second treatment and of 12-h for
   the third treatment. The fourth treatment was applied in four hormonal
   doses that it corresponded to 20\%-20\%-30\%-30\% with 12-h time
   intervals between doses. Only the fishes of the fourth treatment
   resisted the induction, continued to live and reached spawning
   artificially. Water temperature remained at 28 +/- 1 degrees C and at 30
   parts per thousand salinity during the study. The ``dry{''} method of
   fertilization was used. The fertilized eggs were incubated at 30 parts
   per thousand and 35 parts per thousand salinities. These eggs reached
   the Morula early stage, but were later attacked by protozoan. These
   results suggest that fast changes of saline and limited hormonal dosages
   do not offer effective results in Eugerres plumieri. This work provided
   fundamental procedures for the culture and maintenance of live
   broodstock for striped mojarra in saltwater and/ or coastal lagoon
   habitats and provides an effective and viable dosage of CPE for
   artificial spawning and commercial production in this species.},

Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {At the beginning of the 20th century, the main objective of Mendelian
   hybridization was, through controlled crosses, to attain the expression
   of desired ``factors{''}, for example in crop improvement. Because of
   these aims, Mendel's principles were adopted faster among agronomists
   than academic sectors. The change from the Mendelian conception of
   factors to the first genetic maps consisted in looking at genes not as
   abstract and functional entities like in Mendelian studies, but to
   visualise them as dots on a line, as dots on a map in classical
   genetics. What genes could do wasn't any more the core interest; their
   localization on a map was privileged. This new conception was followed
   by a new way to study, interpret and represent the inheritance
   phenomena, also, a new way to conduct experiments different from
   Mendelian hybridization. The construction of the first genetic maps and
   their representations were a successful means to study, explain and
   represent different inheritance issues and was a new way in which
   genetic studies could be done. At the beginning, these maps were
   hypothetical representations that facilitated the handling of empirical
   data as well as the classification of mutants. Later on, the culture of
   mapping strongly contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of
   chromosomes and the hereditary transmission.},

Abstract = {Several methods have been developed to calculate and predict nuclear
   masses over the last 70 years. The accuracy of the present
   state-of-the-art nuclear mass models is impressive, because these
   quantities can be calculated with an average 0.05\% precision. However
   this precision level is still insufficient to deal with nuclear
   reactions of astrophysical interest, especially r-process ones.
   Different approaches exist to calculate nuclear masses, ranging from the
   simple Bethe-Weizsacker Liquid Drop Formula (LDM) to the sophisticated
   Finite Range Droplet Model calculations or the microscopic
   Hartree-Fock-Bogoliuvob techniques from first principles, using Skyme or
   Gogny parametrizations of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Here we
   suggest a new method to calculate this fundamental property of the
   atomic nucleus, using a completely phenomenological point of view. Our
   method is based in the analysis of the differences between measured
   masses and LDM predictions, which contains information related to those
   ingredients not taken into account in the LDM formula, such as shell
   closures, nuclear deformations and residual nuclear interactions. The
   differences are arranged in a two dimensional plot which can be viewed
   as an incomplete image of the full chart of nuclides, equivalent to a
   product of the full image and a binary mask. In order to remove the
   distortions produced by this mask we employ an algorithm, well known in
   astronomy, used to remove artificial effects present in the
   astrophysical images collected through telescopes. This algorithm is
   called the CLEAN method. It is one of a number of methods which exists
   to deconvolve undesirable effects in images and to extrapolate or
   reconstruct missing parts in them. By using the CLEAN method we can fit
   measured masses with an r.m.s error of less than 100 keV We have
   performed several checks and concluded that its utilization must be
   carried out carefully in order to obtain reliable results in the zone of
   unknown masses between the driplines. We also outline potential
   applications of the present approach.},

Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the gene complement of the last common
   ancestor of all extant organisms, that is, the cenancestor, may be
   hindered by ancient horizontal gene transfer events and polyphyletic
   gene losses, as well as by biases in genome databases and methodological
   artifacts. Nevertheless, most reports agree that the last common
   ancestor resembled extant prokaryotes. A significant number of the
   highly conserved genes are sequences involved in the synthesis,
   degradation, and binding of RNA, including transcription and
   translation. Although the gene complement of the cenancestor includes
   sequences that may have originated in different epochs, the
   extraordinary conservation of RNA-related sequences supports the
   hypothesis that the last common ancestor was an evolutionary outcome of
   the so-called RNA/protein world. The available evidence suggests that
   the cenancestor was not a hyperthermophile, but it is currently not
   possible to assess its ecological niche or its mode of energy
   acquisition and carbon sources.},

Title = {Overexpression of MMP9 in macrophages attenuates pulmonary fibrosis
   induced by bleomycin},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY \& CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {39},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2324-2338},
Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a common response to a variety of lung injuries,
   characterized by fibroblast/myofibroblast expansion and abnormal
   accumulation of extracellular matrix. An increased expression of matrix
   metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) in human and experimental lung fibrosis has
   been documented, but its role in the fibrotic response is unclear. We
   studied the effect of MMP9 overexpression in bleomycin-driven lung
   fibrosis using transgenic mice expressing human MMP9 in alveolar
   macrophages (hMMP9-TG). At 8 weeks post-bleomycin, the extent of
   fibrotic lesions and OH-proline content were significantly decreased in
   the TG mice compared to the WT mice. The decreased fibrosis in hMMP9-TG
   mice was preceded by a significant reduction of neutrophils and
   lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 1 and 4 weeks
   post-bleomycin, respectively, as well as by significantly less TIMP-1
   than the WT mice. From a variety of cytokines/chemokines investigated,
   we found that BAL levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3
   (IGFBP3) as well as the immunoreactive protein in the lungs were
   significantly lower in hMMP9-TG rnice compared with WT mice despite
   similar levels of gene expression. Using IGFBP-3 substrate zymography we
   found that BAL from TG mice at 1 week after bleomycin cleaved IGFBP-3.
   Further, we demonstrated that MMP9 degraded IGFBP-3 into lower molecular
   mass fragments. These findings suggest that increased activity of MMP9
   secreted by alveolar macrophages in the lung microenvironment may have
   an antifibrotic effect and provide a potential mechanism involving
   IGFBP3 degradation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of the subgenus Lampetis (Spinthoptera)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships between species of Lampetis (Spinthoptera) of
   North and Central America and the West Indies were analysed by cladistic
   methods, based on 65 characters from the external morphology and male
   genitalia. Eleven species of different generic groups of the subtribe
   Dicercina were considered as outgroups, including also species of
   Lampetis (Lampetis) and one South American species of L. (Spinthoptera).
   The monophyly of Lampetis (Spinthoptera) is supported by two
   synapomorphies, but this subgenus appears to be more closely related to
   species of Psiloptera rather than to Old World species of Lampetis
   (Lampetis), suggesting that Lampetis (Spinthoptera) may be segregated
   from Lampetis as a different genus. The species of Lampetis
   (Spinthoptera) from North and Central America and the West Indies do not
   represent a monophyletic taxon, because L. (S.) tucumana (South American
   outgroup) is nested within them. Comparison of these results with a
   previous panbiogeographic analysis indicate that several generalized
   tracks possess species from different clades, thus suggesting an ancient
   radiation of this taxon in Mesoamerica and the Mexican Transition Zone.},

Abstract = {We consider Sturm-Liouville operators in the half axis generated by
   shifts of the potential and prove that Lebesgue measure is equivalent to
   a measure defined as an average of spectral measures which correspond to
   these operators. This is then used to obtain results on stability of
   spectral types under change of parameters such as boundary conditions,
   local perturbations, and shifts. In particular if for a set of shifts of
   positive measure the corresponding operators have alpha-singular,
   singular continuous and ( or) point spectrum in a fixed interval, then
   this set of shifts has to be unbounded. Moreover, there are large sets
   of boundary conditions and local perturbations for which the
   corresponding operators enjoy the same property.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {41},
Number = {13-16},
Pages = {965-984},
Abstract = {We used ecological niche modelling projected as species' potential (
   based on the original vegetation map) and extant ( based on the 2000
   land use and vegetation map) distributions to analyse changes on
   patterns of endemism of terrestrial mammals occurring in Mexico. Based
   on the biogeographic method of Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity, we
   obtained cladograms under scenarios of species' potential distribution (
   t1) and extant distributions ( t2). We found that the resolution of
   consensus cladogram in t2 was poorer, while there were more geographic
   synapomorphies in t1, and more autapomorphies in t2 due to a reduction
   of species' distributions as a consequence of deforestation. We defined
   a hierarchical regionalization with two regions with the cladogram of
   t1; a transitional zone, two subregions, five dominions, and 15
   provinces. Conversely, the consensus cladogram of t2 had a basal
   trichotomy, and the position of the Sierra Madre Occidental changed
   compared with t1. In t1 and t2, the Yucatan Peninsula+ Chiapas+ Isthmus
   of Tehuantepec clade was maintained, although in t2 it was separated
   from the remaining areas of the country. The impact of deforestation on
   species distributions strongly affected the biogeographic
   regionalization of terrestrial mammals in Mexico.},

Abstract = {Theoretical prediction of nuclear masses is analyzed as a pattern
   recognition problem on the N-Z plane. A global pattern is observed by
   plotting the differences between measured masses and Liquid Drop Model
   (LDM) predictions. After unfolding the data by removing the smooth LDM
   mass contributions, the remaining microscopic effects have proved
   difficult to model, although they display a striking pattern. These
   deviations carry information related to shell closures, nuclear
   deformation and the residual nuclear interactions. In the present work
   the more than 2000 known nuclear masses are studied as an array in the
   N-Z plane viewed through a mask, behind which the approximately 7000
   unknown unstable nuclei that can exist between the proton and neutron
   drip lines are hidden. Employing a Fourier transform deconvolution
   method these masses can be predicted. Measured masses are reconstructed
   with and r.m.s. error of less than 200 keV. The existence of an island
   of stability around (Z approximate to 116, N approximate to 194) is
   strongly suggested. Other potential applications of the present approach
   are outlined.},

Title = {Understanding cultural significance, the edible mushrooms case},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Background: Cultural significance is a keystone in quantitative
   ethnobiology, which offers the possibility to make inferences about
   traditional nomenclature systems, use, appropriation and valuing of
   natural resources. In the present work, using as model the traditional
   mycological knowledge of Zapotecs from Oaxaca, Mexico, we analyze the
   cultural significance of wild edible resources.
   Methods: In 2003 we applied 95 questionnaires to a random sample of
   informants. With this data we integrated the Edible Mushroom Cultural
   Significance Index. This index included eight variables: frequency of
   mention, perceived abundance, use frequency, taste, multifunctional food
   use, knowledge transmission, health and economy. Data were analyzed in
   an inductive perspective using ordination and grouping techniques to
   reveal the behavior of species in a cultural multivariate dimension.
   ZResults: In each variable the species had different conducts.
   Cantharellus cibarius s.l. was the species with most frequency of
   mention. Pleurotus sp. had the highest perceived abundance. C. cibarius
   s.l. was the most frequently consumed species. Gomphus clavatus was the
   most palatable species and also ranked highest in the multifunctional
   food index. Cortinarius secc.Malacii sp. had the highest traditional
   importance. Only Tricholoma magnivelare was identified as a health
   enhancer. It also had the most economic importance. According to the
   compound index, C. cibarius s.l., the Amanita caesarea complex, Ramaria
   spp. and Neolentinus lepideus were the mushrooms with highest cultural
   significance. Multivariate analysis showed that interviewees identify
   three main groups of mushrooms: species with high traditional values,
   frequent consumption and known by the majority; species that are less
   known, infrequently consumed and without salient characteristics; and
   species with low traditional values, with high economic value and health
   enhancers.
   Conclusion: The compound index divided the cultural significance into
   several cultural domains and showed the causes that underlie this
   phenomenon. This approach can be used in cross-cultural studies because
   it brings a list with the relative position of species among a cultural
   significance gradient. This list is suitable for comparisons and also it
   is flexible because cultural variables can be included or removed to
   adjust it to the nature of the different cultures or resources under
   study.},

   integral equation for the general theory of the boundary function. We
   derive a new boundary function valid for hight opening velocities, which
   for short times has the correct quantum behavior, and for long times we
   recover the Kirchhoff BC as a particular case.},

   color becomes darker and its refractive index and dielectric
   permittivity reach a minimum. d) Of special interest, because of its
   possible industrial applications, is the polymerization process that
   occurs at around 160 degrees C. Studies made in ultra pure sulfur
   (99.999\%) have shed some light on this phenomenon, but a coherent
   picture is still missing. The properties of sulfur are strongly affected
   by impurities and dissolved gases, so that a great deal of care is
   necessary when performing these experiments. If the purpose is to take
   advantages of these properties for industrial applications, one must
   rule out the use of ultra-pure sulfur and think in terms of a simple
   process with a commercial substance. In this work we shall report some
   infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results
   obtained in our attempts at the polymerization of commercial Mexican
   sulfur.},

Abstract = {>From the theoretical point of view, the problem of the dissociation of
   molecules induced by collisions is complex due to the coupling of the
   electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, thus few theoretical approach
   exist that can compare directly with experiment. In this work an
   experimental and theoretical study of the total cross section for
   fragmentation of CO2+ ions into the C+ and O+ product channels induced
   by collisions with atomic He for projectile energies from I to 10 keV is
   presented. Our preliminary results show that the cross section for the
   C+ fragment is higher than the cross section for O+ fragment and both
   grow monotonically, although our theoretical results show larger cross
   sections at low projectile energies.},

Abstract = {Ants are a very important element in and and semiarid environments, not
   only because of their abundance and diversity, but also because of the
   many ecological functions that they perform. In Mexico, Zapotitlan
   (Tehuacan Valley) is a very important and area with remarkable
   biodiversity and large numbers of endemic ant species, even though there
   have been very few studies about ants in that region. The aim of the
   present study is to obtain information about the foraging activity of
   Camponotus rubrithorax (Forel), a very common ant in Zapotitlan, in
   relation to resource availability, and to determine the ecological role
   of this ant in the area. Our results show that C rubrithorax walks short
   distances in search of food and selects resources depending on their
   abundance. The results suggest some level of myrmecochory between
   Sanvitalia fruticosa, Caesalpinia melanadenia and Choriphanta pallida
   plants and C. rubrithorax.},

Abstract = {Let P-n be a set of n points on the plane in general position, n >= 4. A
   convex quadrangulation of P-n is a partitioning of the convex hull
   Conv(P-n) of P-n into a set of quadrilaterals such that their vertices
   are elements of P-n, and no element of P-n lies in the interior of any
   quadrilateral. It is straightforward to see that if P admits a
   quadrilaterization, its convex hull must have an even number of
   vertices. In {[}6] it was proved that if the convex hull of P-n has an
   even number of points, then by adding at most 3n/2 Steiner points in the
   interior of its convex hull, we can always obtain a point set that
   admits a convex quadrangulation. The authors also show that n/4 Steiner
   points are sometimes necessary. In this paper we show how to improve the
   upper and lower bounds of {[}6] to 4n/5 + 2 and to n/3 respectively. In
   fact, in this paper we prove an upper bound of n, and with a long and
   unenlightening case analysis (over fifty cases!) we can improve the
   upper bound to 4n/5 + 2, for details see {[}9].},

   to mimic the presence of quantum chaos associated with neutron
   resonances at energies between 6 to 10 MeV, calculations include random
   interactions in the upper shells. The upper bound for the energy
   fluctuations at mid-shell is shown to have the form sigma(A)approximate
   to 20A(-1.34) MeV. This estimate is consistent with the mass errors
   found in large shell model calculations along the N=126 line, and with
   local mass error estimated using the Garvey-Kelson relations, all being
   smaller than 100 keV.},

Abstract = {A quantum theory is developed for the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in
   GaAs/AlGaAs. The envelope of the oscillation for the magnetoresistance
   is shown to be proportional to {[}sinh(2 pi M-2{*} k(B)T/heB)](-1),
   where M{*} is the carrier mass. Comparison between theory and experiment
   directly gives the M{*}-value: M{*} = 0.30 m, which is 4.5 times the
   cyclotron mass m{*} = 0.067 m. The carriers are electrons, each with two
   flux quanta. The theory avoids the use of the Dingle temperature arising
   from the ``Landau level damping{''}. The susceptibility is an
   equilibrium property which must be calculated without introducing the
   scattering mechanism. Both magnetic oscillations decay with the inverse
   field like exp{[}-2 pi(2) M{*} k(B)T/heB)].},

   energy input needed per unit length of the wire and the critical wire
   temperature for ignition have been obtained for different values of the

Title = {Influence of local illumination and plant composition on the spatial and

   rainforest},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-145},
Abstract = {Using pitfall traps, we evaluated the spatial and seasonal variance in
   arthropod abundance, species richness, higher taxonomic and species
   composition, and guild structure within the ground litter of seven sites
   in a relatively undisturbed rainforest in Panama. We examined each of
   these five arthropod-dependent variables at two spatial scales (a few
   meters and a few hundred meters) and one temporal scale (a few months
   encompassing dry and wet periods), against environmental variables
   including local illumination and plant composition. Trap catches (9458
   arthropods collected during 630 trap-days) were high compared to similar
   studies in temperate forests. We observed spatial and seasonal
   differences in abundance, species richness and composition of
   litter-dwelling arthropods. Often these differences appeared weakly
   related to geographical coordinates. They reflected forest structure
   (basal area) and local plant composition, and less so illumination
   patterns or seasonal changes in radiation. Seasonal variance was high
   and may relate to surrogate variables accounting for seasonal changes in
   litter moisture. The composition of higher taxa and species was often
   predicted by different independent variables at the three scales
   studied. Guild structure was difficult to predict. Our study lead us to
   expect that litter-dwelling arthropods may be more seasonal than soil
   microarthropods in tropical rainforests; and that tropical
   litter-dwelling arthropods may also be more spatially variable and
   seasonal than their temperate counterparts. We also recommend that
   conservation studies using pitfall traps in tropical rainforests should
   focus on: (1) taxonomic resolution to understand the functional
   complexity of soil organisms; (2) spatial replication to address subtle
   changes in plant composition throughout the study area; and (3) seasonal
   replicates to be commensurate with seasonal changes in litter moisture.

Journal = {EPL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {It is shown that ``negative heat capacity{''} in nanoclusters is an
   artifact of applying equilibrium thermodynamic formalism on a
   ``small{''} system trapped in a metastable state differing from true
   thermodynamic equilibrium. Trapping occurs due to high-energy barriers
   separating different regions of the cluster phase space, particularly
   for cluster sizes near the magic numbers corresponding to closed
   geometrical shells. Trapping may occur in either the canonical or
   microcanonical ensemble, but it is unavoidable in the microcanonical and
   can lead to a dependence on initial conditions of the determined cluster
   properties. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2007.},

Title = {Global diversity and distribution of macrofungi},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Data on macrofungal diversity and distribution patterns were compiled
   for major geographical regions of the world. Macrofungi are defined here
   to include ascomycetes and basidiomycetes with large, easily observed
   spore-bearing structures that form above or below ground. Each coauthor
   either provided data on a particular taxonomic group of macrofungi or
   information on the macrofungi of a specific geographic area. We then
   employed a meta-analysis to investigate species overlaps between areas,
   levels of endemism, centers of diversity, and estimated percent of
   species known for each taxonomic group for each geographic area and for
   the combined macrofungal data set. Thus, the study provides both a
   meta-analysis of current data and a gap assessment to help identify
   research needs. In all, 21,679 names of macrofungi were compiled. The
   percentage of unique names for each region ranged from 37\% for
   temperate Asia to 72\% for Australasia. Approximately 35,000 macrofungal
   species were estimated to be ``unknown{''} by the contributing authors.
   This would give an estimated total of 56,679 macrofungi. Our compiled
   species list does not include data from most of S.E. Europe, Africa,
   western Asia, or tropical eastern Asia. Even so, combining our list of
   names with the estimates from contributing authors is in line with our
   calculated estimate of between 53,000 and 110,000 macrofungal species
   derived using plant/macrofungal species ratio data. The estimates
   developed in this study are consistent with a hypothesis of high overall
   fungal species diversity.},

   through doping, since their modified transport properties can be
   exploited in electronic nano-devices such as diodes, transistors, etc.
   In this work we study the normal modes of vibration of the armchair
   (4,4) nanotube: pristine and with nitrogen doping. We used the Density
   Functional Theory approach including periodic boundary conditions to
   obtain the ab initio Hessian tensor.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are important for global nitrogen cycle and often form
   complex associations referred to as cyanobacterial mats or periphyton
   that are common in tropical, limestone-based wetlands. The objective of
   this study was to monitor the nitrogen fixation rate using the acetylene
   reduction assay of these cyanobacterial mats in a tropical,
   unfertilized, and protected wetland. To account for temporal and spatial
   variation of nitrogenase activity, we were interested in seasons in a
   hydrological cycle (dry, rains, and end of rains), sites with different
   vascular vegetation, and rates of nitrogenase activity in a 24-h cycle.
   The annual average of nitrogenase activity was 22 nmol C2H4 cm(-2)
   h(-1), with a range of < 6 to 35 nmol C2H4 cm(-2) h(-1), and the annual
   nitrogen fixation rate of our study site (9.0 g N m(-2) year(-1)) is
   higher than similar estimates from other freshwater wetlands. There was
   a clear temporal pattern in nitrogenase activity with a maximum rate
   occurring during the rainy season (August) and a maximum nitrogenase
   activity occurring between 0600 and 1200 hours. We found spatial
   differences in nitrogenase activity among the four sites that could be
   attributed to variations in species composition within the periphyton.},

Abstract = {In this work, we have theoretically analyzed the conversion process of
   hydrogen sulfide, H2S, to atomic hydrogen, H-0, in a planar
   stagnation-point flow over an iron-metallic surface. We assume that a
   binary mixture of hydrogen sulfide and methane composes the laminar
   stagnation flow. In order to characterize this complex phenomenon with
   very specific chemical activities on the surface of the metallic plate,
   we propose a heterogeneous reaction scheme based on four reactions: two
   electrochemical, one adsorption and an additional exothermic reaction
   needed to complete the direct conversion of hydrogen sulfide to hydrogen
   on the surface of the iron. The nondimensional governing equations,
   which include the mass species and momentum conservation of the mixture
   and the molecular diffusion of hydrogen into the iron plate, are
   numerically solved by conventional finite-difference methods. The
   numerical results show the critical conditions of the H2S decomposition
   as functions of the involved nondimensional parameters of the present
   model. In particular, we show parametrically the influence that has the
   initial concentration of H2S on the surface coverage of the chemical
   products HS- H+ and H-0 derived from the chemical and electrochemical
   reactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Transmexican Volcanic Belt is recognized as a province based on
   geologic, tectonic, geomorphologic and biogeographic characteristics.
   The Belt is a volcanic arch extending from the Pacific coast in Jalisco
   and Nayarit states to the Atlantic coast in Veracruz. Its formation
   began in the middle Miocene, with a final episode in the last
   Pliocene-Quaternary, where most of the volcanic complex was formed. A
   trace analysis of 136 organisms (birds, mammals, reptiles, ferns and
   oaks) was undertaken, and 8 generalized traces and 15 nodes were found.
   Six of them were found in the Cuencas de Toluca-Mexico-Puebla region.
   Several of the nodes found were reported in previous works, and many of
   them coincide with priority terrestrial regions and important bird
   conservation areas. Using complementarity analysis, four conservation
   priority areas are proposed, following the criteria of conserving the
   lowest number of areas with a large number of species. These areas are,
   in order of importance: Valle de Mexico-Sierra de Chichinautzin-Sierra
   Nevada corridor, Cofre de Perote-Canon de Rio Blanco corridor, Volcan de
   San Juan node, and Patzcuaro node.},

Abstract = {The ovarian follicle growth in Petenia splendida and Parachromis
   managuensis was analyzed. Both species presented analogous follicular
   growth, reaching similar values within the gonadosomatic and somatic
   indices (I-G) to those reported in other cichlids; however, with regard
   to maturity, these indices were significantly greater in Pe. splendida
   than in Pa. managuensis. The histology of oogenesis coincided with that
   known from most teleosts, except for one difference: the granulosa layer
   of Pa. managuensis was composed of pseudo-stratified columnar cells,
   whereas other species presented columnar cells. Another conspicuous
   difference was registered in the first stage of oocyte maturation: Pa.
   managuensis exhibited the entire spectrum from primary to vitellogenic
   follicles, whereas in Pe. splendida only primary follicles occurred at
   that stage. It is concluded that Pa. managuensis shows a reproductive
   strategy with very short spawning periods, influencing the colonization
   capacity in the Grijalva-Usumacinta River system. Both species, however,
   may still be considered as synchronic breeders, based on the
   characteristics of the maturation process of their oocytes despite their
   slightly different mode.},

Abstract = {A synopsis of the 57 species and 24 genera of New World fleas
   parasitizing species of Soricidae is provided, with synonymical lists,
   and distributional and host data. Species analyzed belong to the
   families Ceratophyllidae (10 genera), Ctenophthalmidae (10 genera),
   Hystrichopsyllidae (two genera), and Leptopsyllidae (two genera). Three
   subspecies are elevated to species: Corrodopsylla lira, C. obtusata, and
   Nearctopsylla hygini. Soricid hosts include 17 species of Sorex, four
   species of Cryptotis, two species of Blarina, and one species of
   Crocidura. The species hosting the highest number of flea species is
   Blarina brevicauda (19 flea species), followed by Sorex cinereus (16),
   S. pacificus (9), S. trowbridgii (8), S. fumeus (7), S. palustris (7),
   and Cryptotis parva (7). Most of the flea species analyzed are
   polyxenous, and belong mainly to genera associated to small rodents and
   marginally present on Soricidae. The association with Soricidae seems to
   be more evident in species of Corrodopsylla, Corypsylla, Ctenophthalmus,
   Doratopsylla, Hystrichopsylla, and Nearctopsylla. Only Corrodopsylla
   lira, C. barrerai, Ctenophthalmus cryptotis, C. expansus, C. myodosus,
   Hystrichopsylla cryptotis, H. guatemalensis, Nearctopsylla georgiana, N.
   pfitzeri, and N. princei are apparently stenoxenous or monoxenous. Taxa
   analyzed belong to the Nearctic biotic element and are specially
   diversified in the Mexican Transition Zone.},

Title = {Historical biogeographical patterns of the species of Bursera
   (Burseraceae) and their taxonomic implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Aim The plant genus Bursera, with 104 species of trees and shrubs, has
   been used as a model for biogeographical analyses because of its high
   species richness and large number of endemic species. The
   biogeographical patterns of Bursera and their implications for its
   phylogenetic classification are reviewed in order that some hypotheses
   on the historical biogeography of tropical Mexico can be proposed.
   Location Bursera is found in the south-western USA, most of Mexico,
   mainly below 1700 m elevation in tropical forests, with some species in
   xeric shrublands, diversifying along the Pacific slope, Central America,
   and north-western South America. A few species occur on the Galapagos
   and Revillagigedo archipelagos, some of which are endemics, whereas in
   the Antilles species are distributed extensively, with several endemics
   in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.
   Methods Data from specimens in herbaria and the literature were used to
   construct a matrix of 104 species in 160 areas. Distributional patterns
   of the species of Bursera were inferred applying track analysis,
   parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), and Brooks parsimony analysis
   (BPA).
   Results Track analysis revealed four individual tracks: (1) a
   circum-Caribbean track, comprising species of the Bursera simaruba
   species group; (2) an Antillean track, including species that have been
   transferred to Commiphora based on their pollen traits; (3) a Mexican
   Pacific track, including species of the B. fragilis, B. microphylla, and
   B. fagaroides species groups, called `cuajiotes'; and (4) a Neotropical
   Pacific track, including the two species groups assigned to section
   Bullockia, in which the individual track of the Bursera copallifera
   species group is nested within the track of the B. glabrifolia species
   group. The four tracks overlap in a node in the Mexican Pacific slope,
   where they are highly diversified. PAE allowed us to identify 22 areas
   of endemism: 12 in Mexico (11 along the Mexican Pacific slope), six in
   the Antilles, two in Central America, one in South America, and one in
   the Galapagos. The general area cladogram obtained by BPA has two main
   clades: one includes the greater Antilles; and the other, 12 Mexican
   areas of endemism.
   Main conclusions Bursera fragilis, B. microphylla, and B. fagaroides
   species groups can be treated together as a new section within Bursera,
   sect. Quaxiotea, because they are segregated from the other groups of
   sect. Bursera based on morphological, anatomical, molecular and
   geographical evidence.},

Abstract = {This study describes the effects of different salinities on oxygen
   consumption, ammonia excretion, osmotic pressure, apparent heat
   increment, postprandial nitrogen excretion, and oxygen:nitrogen ratio in
   juvenile common snook Centropomus undecimalis. Oxygen consumption of
   fish fasting and fish feeding was statistically different in relation
   with salinity. Fish maintained at 0, 25, and 35 ppt invested more energy
   processing feed than fish maintained at 12 ppt. Fasting fish had lower
   ammonia excretion than feeding fish and excretion was reduced at high
   salinities. Snook can change the energetic substrate in function with
   salinity, from a mixture of protein and lipids and carbohydrates at 35
   ppt to a more acute preference for proteins at lower salinities. This
   species changes osmotic plasma concentrations at extreme experimental
   salinities. The different salinities were the snook inhabits (0-36 ppt),
   have a direct effect on the physiology, inducing changes on the oxygen
   consumption, nitrogen excretion, changes on the energetic substrate and
   plasma osmotic pressure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   the system contains contributions arising from the finite size of the

Abstract = {We studied the changes in ant communities within agricultural ecosystems
   according with their seasonal variation and type of irrigation (well
   water and wastewater) in five plots. Plots were located in the Mezquital
   Valley, in the central Mexico. Collects were carried out in 2003, from
   February to March (dry season) and August (rainy season) using Pitfall
   traps. A total of 1638 organisms were collected (477 and 1161, dry and
   rainy season, respectively), corresponding to 16 genera, Pheidole
   (42.38\%) and Monomorium (26.67\%) were the most frequently collected.
   The capture frequency of ants was 0.58 throughout the whole study (0.45
   and 0.71, dry and rainy season, respectively). An ANOVA two-ways
   analysis shows a significant season, plot and interaction effect on the
   ant capture frequency. A high diversity was observed during the rainy
   season (14 species). The plots with low disturbances show more species
   richness and abundance, indicating that the quality of the water is a
   determining factor for the community structure. The genera Tapinoma and
   Odontomachus could be indicators of low disturbance levels. (c) 2006

Abstract = {The relationship between scent composition and antennal sensitivity in
   different castes of Atta mexicana is investigated under laboratory
   conditions. Extracts of dead ants are analysed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the compounds presumably
   responsible for the specific undertaking behaviour. Oleic acid is
   identified as one compound that triggers undertaking behaviour. To
   determine differences in odour reception between workers of different
   castes (i.e. foragers, undertakers and soldiers), further antennal
   sensitivity to task-related odours is tested using electroantennographic
   techniques. Soldiers are the most specialized caste because of their low
   response to all odours, except odourants related to alarm pheromones.
   The behavioural specialization of soldiers and their reduced behavioural
   repertoire are discussed.},

Abstract = {The differences between measured masses and Liquid Drop Model (LDM)
   predictions have well known regularities, which can be analyzed as a
   two-dimensional texture on the N-Z plane. The remaining microscopic
   effects, obtained after removing the smooth LDM mass contributions, have
   proved difficult to model. They contain all the information related to
   shell closures, nuclear deformation and the residual nuclear
   interactions, and display a well defined pattern. In the present work
   the more than 2000 known nuclear masses are studied as an array in the
   N-Z plane viewed through a mask, behind which the approximately 7000
   unknown unstable nuclei that can exist between the proton and neutron
   drip lines are hidden. Employing a Fourier transform deconvolution
   method these masses can be predicted. Measured masses are reconstructed
   with and r.m.s. error of less than 100 keV. Potential applications of
   the present approach are outlined.},

Abstract = {Fibroblast/myofibroblast expansion is critical in the pathogenesis of
   pulmonary fibrosis. To date, most research has focused on profibrotic
   mediators, whereas studies on antifibrotic factors are scanty. In this
   study, we explored the effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor
   (FGF-1) and FGF-1 plus heparin (FGF-1+H) on fibroblast growth rate,
   apoptosis, and myofibroblast differentiation. Heparin was used because
   it participates in FGF-1 signaling. Growth rate was evaluated by WST-1
   colorimetric assay, DNA synthesis by {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation, and
   apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
   end labeling (TUNEL) and cleaved caspase 3. Expression of alpha-smooth
   muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was examined by immunocytochemistry, flow
   cytometry, real-time PCR, and immunoblotting. Despite the induction of
   DNA synthesis, FGF-1+H significantly reduced fibroblast growth rate.
   This correlated with a significant increase in apoptosis, evaluated by
   TUNEL (41.6 +/- 1.4\% vs. 12.5 +/- 0.6\% from controls; P < 0.01) and
   cleaved caspase 3 (295 +/- 32 vs. 200 +/- 19 ng/10(6) cells from
   controls; P < 0.05). Double immunostaining (alpha-SMA-TUNEL) revealed
   that the levels of induced apoptosis were similar in fibroblasts and
   myofibroblasts. FGF-1+H inhibited the effect of TGF-beta 1 on
   myofibroblast differentiation. alpha-SMA-positive cells were reduced by
   immunocytochemistry from 44.5 +/- 6.5\% to 10.9 +/- 1.9\% and by flow
   cytometry from 30.6 +/- 2.5\% to 7.7 +/- 0.6\% (P < 0.01). Also, FGF-1+H
   significantly inhibited the TGF-beta 1 induction of alpha-SMA quantified
   by real-time PCR and Western blot. This decrease was associated with a
   35\% reduction in TGF-beta 1-induced collagen gel contraction. The
   effect of FGF-1+H was mediated by a significant decrease of TGF-beta
   1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation. FGF-1 alone exhibited similar but lower
   effects. These findings suggest that FGF- 1 can have an antifibrogenic
   role, inducing apoptosis of fibroblasts and inhibiting myofibroblast
   differentiation.},

Abstract = {The electronic structure of the intermetallic LaNi3B as well as the

   band calculations and molecular cluster computations. We computed the
   energy bands and the total and partial density of states using both the
   linear-augmented plane waves and projector-augmented wave methods. In
   addition the electronic structure of three representative clusters of
   the local environment of Ni atoms was investigated by quantum chemistry
   ab initio molecular calculations. In this report, we discuss the
   chemical bonding and we investigated the H site occupancy energies and
   correlate this estimate with the occupancy fraction and metal-hydrogen

Volume = {53},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Parasitism and predation are two ecological interactions that can occur
   simultaneously between two species. This is the case of Culicidae
   (Insecta: Diptera) and water mites (Acari: Hydrachnidia). The larva
   mites are parasites of aquatic and semiaquatic insects, and deutonymphs
   and adults are predators of insect larvae and eggs. Since several
   families of water mites are associated with mosquitoes there is an
   interest in the potential use of these mites as biological control
   agents. The aim of this paper is to use mathematical modelling and
   analysis to assess the impact of predation and parasitism in the
   mosquito population. We propose a system of ordinary differential
   equations to model the interactions among the larval and adult stages of
   mosquitoes and water mites. The model exhibits three equilibria: the
   first equilibrium point corresponds to the state where the two species
   are absent, the second one to the state where only mosquitoes are
   present (water mites need insects to complete their life cycle), and the
   third one is the coexistence equilibrium. We analyze conditions for the
   asymptotic stability of equilibria, supported by analytical and
   numerical methods. We discuss the different scenarios that appear when
   we change the parasitism and predation parameters. High rates of
   parasitism and moderate predation can drive two species to a stable
   coexistence.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria, mosses and lichens are the main components of biological
   soil crusts that cover extensive areas of cold and hot deserts.
   Approximately 50 species of cyanobacteria, 52 species of mosses and 34
   species of lichens have been described from North American deserts. We
   collected samples of biological crusts from 87 sites in the rainshadow
   desert of Tehuacan, Puebla, central Mexico, to compare the assemblages
   of cyanobacteria and mosses with those from other North American sites.
   We found seven species of cyanobacteria, 19 species of mosses and eight
   species of lichens within the sampled soil crusts. Cyanobacteria were
   present in all crusts, with the most common species being Scytonema
   javanicum, Microcoleus paludosus and Chroococcidiopsis sp. Seven species
   of mosses are unique to the region, with Pottiaceae and Bryaceae being
   the best represented families. Placydium squamulosum and Lepraria spp.
   were the most common lichens. Sorensen analysis shows that the
   assemblages of cyanobacteria and moss communities of Tehuacan are
   different from other deserts, despite the presence of several
   cosmopolitan species in the sampled soil crusts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {L. vannamei postlarvae are normally raised with a protein dense diet
   (50\% protein) rich in fishmeal. Part of the protein is utilized for
   energy purpose instead of protein synthesis. Based on a previous energy
   partitioning study, the effects of two isoenergetic compounded feed
   treatments - animal protein (AP) and vegetable protein and carbohydrates
   (VPC) - upon growth efficiency and energy budget of shrimp postlarvae
   and early juveniles were determined. Recovered energy (RE) or production
   (P) after 50 days trial was similar (2 J day(-1)) in both treatments,
   from PL14 to PL19. However, early juveniles discriminated between animal
   protein (116 J day(-1)) and vegetable protein and carbohydrates (88 J
   day(-1)). The difference in respiration indicated a higher heat
   increment with AP compared to VPC. At maintenance level, energy used was
   lower with AP than VPC treatment. Post-larvae and early juveniles
   employed protein as a main energy substrate (O:N < 20). Differences in
   the efficiencies observed in the calculated energy budget were
   attributed to the presence of carbohydrates in diet and not to the
   protein source. The advantage of incorporating vegetable protein source
   in the diet of harvesting shrimp may eventually contribute towards a
   reduction of fishmeal costs and waste products as well as to achieve
   sustainable shrimp farming. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   the presence of periodic leads, which are usually employed as the
   measurement connections. Furthermore, when the system is periodic along
   the applied electrical field, a quantized dc conductance spectrum is
   observed at zero temperature and this quantized spectrum is destroyed
   when an oscillating electrical field is introduced. However, when the
   electric field is applied along a quasiperiodic direction of the system,
   the ac conductance spectrum shows a non-Drude behaviour, in good
   agreement with experiment results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Ever since Johann Bernoulli put forward the challenge ``Problema novum
   ad cujus solutionem Mathematice invitantur{''} in Acta Eruditorum
   Lipsiae of June, 1696, of finding the minimum time trajectory (the
   brachistochrone) described by an object moving from one point to another
   (not directly behind the first one) in a constant uniform gravitational
   field, many works have been published on this subject, and some books
   mention it as part of the applications of the Euler-Lagrange formalism.
   However, we have found only one reference of the problem related to the
   general inhomogeneous inverse square gravitational field (Supplee and
   Schmidt 1991 Am. J. Phys. 59 467). Even in this reference, the problem
   is treated for particular initial conditions. In this work, we develop a
   simplified method to arrive to the equation of the brachistochrone curve
   for an arbitrary potential and also to the inverse formulation of the
   problem: what type of potential energy function is associated with a
   specified brachistochrone curve?},

Title = {Evolution of the series Microphyllae (Adesmia, Fabaceae)
   in the Andean Cordillera:: a biogeographic approach},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {79},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-404},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Microphyllae (subgenus Acanthadesmia) is the series of the genus Adesmia
   with the largest number of described species, and its distribution
   includes most of the genus range. The biogeographic evolutionary history
   of this series, as well as the genus, is unclear. Some hypotheses
   suggest that the development of the Andes affected the evolution of the
   genus Adesmia, but there is no evidence about the processes (e.g.,
   dispersal or vicariance) involved. In this study we used a
   panbiogeographic approach, and based on the distribution of 22 species
   of this series we carried out a track analysis and a parsimony analysis
   of endemicity (PAE). Distribution area of the series was divided in
   quadrats of 1 degrees x 1 degrees (Latitude x Longitude), and
   latitudinal and longitudinal belts of 1 degrees. All the species
   presented a distribution associated with the Andes, and most of them
   presented both latitudinally and longitudinally restricted
   distributions. Five generalized tracks and two nodes were found. All
   tracks were longitudinally associated with the Andean range. Nodes could
   be associated with the South American Transition Zone. PAE based on
   latitudinal belts split the total area in two sub-areas (north and
   south), where the limit between them is central Chile (ca. 33 degrees
   S). This division is characterized by the presence of A. miraflorensis
   in the northern zone, and A. volckmannii in the southern zone. Our
   results suggest a recent differentiation within the series Microphyllae,
   which may have resulted from isolation of populations along the Andes,
   i.e., vicariance events fragmented the distribution of species and
   subsequently caused differentiation. It seems likely that this
   separation has occurred latitudinally, as suggested by the latitudinal
   sequence of generalized tracks.},

   eV) were observed. The optical density is a linear function of dose up
   to 2500 Gy and then sublinear for the 5.0 eV band, and for the 4.0 eV
   band it is sublinear with a filling constant of 2.1 x 10(-4) and 6.2 x
   10(-4) Gy(-1). The dose response of the 2.8 eV band is linear from 2500
   Gy to 10 kGy with a slope of 1.0 x 10(-5) Gy(-1). Once the absorption
   spectra were obtained, the glow curves and the TL response were

Abstract = {The virulence of the bacterial strains CAIM 333 and CAIM 372 identified

   densities of 10(5) CFU ml(-1). There was no difference in virulence
   observed between the two strains of V campbellii. The shrimp zoea stages
   were more susceptible to the CAIM 333 strain. L. vannamei larvae did not
   show any susceptibility to the bacterial strain CAIM 79. No statistical
   correlation (P > 0.05) was found between the number of CAIM 333 and CAIM
   79 bacteria inoculated and ingested (inside the digestive tract), and no
   statistical correlation (P > 0.05) was found between number of CAIM 333
   bacteria ingested and shrimp larval mortality. The colonization process
   begins in the oral region, followed by the cephalotorax and then the
   inside the MGT. A 2 h exposure experiment (Exp-2 h) proved to be better
   to evaluate the colonization process when compared to a 24 h exposure

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {74},

Abstract = {Human chromosome 21 is the only chromosome in the human genome that
   exhibits oscillation of the (G+C) content of a cycle length of hundreds
   kilobases (kb) (500 kb near the right telomere). We aim at establishing
   the existence of a similar periodicity in structure-related sequence
   features in order to relate this (G+C)\% oscillation to other biological
   phenomena. The following quantities are shown to oscillate with the same
   500 kb periodicity in human chromosome 21: binding energy calculated by
   two sets of dinucleotide-based thermodynamic parameters, AA/TT and
   AAA/TTT bi- and tri-nucleotide density, 5(')-TA-3(') dinucleotide
   density, and signal for 10- or 11-base periodicity of AA/TT or AAA/TTT.
   These intrinsic quantities are related to structural features of the
   double helix of DNA molecules, such as base-pair binding, untwisting or
   unwinding, stiffness, and a putative tendency for nucleosome formation.},

Abstract = {In the study of standardly stratified algebras and stratifying systems.
   we find an object which is either a tilting module or one whose
   properties strongly remind us of a tilting module. This tilting module
   appeared already in Dlab and Ringel's work on quasi-hereditary algebras
   (see {[}V. Dlab, C.M. Ringel, The module theoretical approach to
   quasi-hereditary algebras, in: Repr. Theory and Related Topics, in:
   London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser. 168 (1992) 200-224] and {[}C.M.
   Ringel, The category of modules with good filtrations over a
   quasi-hereditary algebra has almost split sequences, Math. Z. 208 (1991)
   209-223]). Also, this tilting module appears on the work on standardly
   stratified algebras of I. Agoston, D. Happel, E. Lukacs, and L. Unger,
   and in the paper of M.I. Platzeck and I. Reiten (see {[}I. Agoston, D.
   Happel, E. Lukacs. L. Unger. Standardly stratified algebras and tilting,
   J. Algebra 226 (2000) 144-160] and {[}M.I. Platzeck, I. Reiten. Modules
   of finite projective dimension for standardly stratified algebras, Comm.
   Algebra 29 (3) (2001) 973-986]). Inspired by them, we introduce the
   notion of tilting category in order to give a unified approach of these
   Situations for stratifying systems. To do so, we use the ideas of M.
   Auslander. O. Buchweitz and I. Reiten related to approximation theory
   (see {[}M. Auslander. R.O. Buchweitz. The homological theory of maximal
   Cohen-Macaulay approximations. Mem. Soc. Math. Fr. (ICS.) 38 (1989)
   5-37; M. Auslander, I. Reiten, Applications of contravariantly finite
   subcategories, Adv. Math. 86 (1991) 111-152]). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {An analysis is presented of the time-periodic conjugate free convective
   heat transfer from a long vertical, thermally thin fin heated from above
   to the surrounding fluid. The temperature at the top of the fin
   oscillates with a given frequency about a mean value that, is higher
   than the temperature of the ambient fluid. The solution for very long
   fins depends on four nondimensional parameters: the Prandtl number of
   the fluid; the relative amplitude of the thermal oscillation; the
   Fourier number, which is the ratio of the period of the thermal
   oscillation to the conduction time in the fin over a length determined
   by the steady solution;, and the ratio of this latter time to the
   residence time of the fluid in the boundary layer. Numerical and
   asymptotic results are given covering a wide region of the parametric
   space. A linearized version of the governing equations is worked out and
   shown to give oscillatory Nusselt numbers in excellent accordance with
   the results from the full nonlinear equations.},

Abstract = {Mossbauer spectra of a series of samples of the weak ferromagnetic
   (Ru1-xFex) system reveal the existence of three dissimilar sites where
   the Fe atoms can go into the structure. The Mossbauer parameters of the
   three observed quadrupole doublets, together with the relative
   population on each site, allow the following site assignment for the
   iron atoms: Fe3+ in four-fold planar coordination at Ru sites; Fe3+ in
   five-fold pyramidal coordination also at Ru sites and Fe2+ or Fe3+ in
   five-fold coordination at Cu sites. This assignment implies the
   formation of oxygen-vacancies at the charge reservoir (the RuO2 planes)
   that affect the structure and the superconducting and magnetic
   properties of the undoped system. Moreover, a close correlation between
   the oxygen content, calculated through the Mossbauer data, and the
   measured cell volume is established. We also report the Mossbauer
   spectra of two compounds (SrRu0.95Fe0.05O3 and Gd2Cu0.95Fe0.05O4) that
   could be formed as impurities during the synthesis of our samples.},

Abstract = {Shell model calculations are employed to estimate an upper limit of
   statistical fluctuations in the nuclear ground-state energies. In order
   to mimic the presence of quantum chaos associated with neutron
   resonances at energies between 6 and 10MeV, calculations include random
   interactions in the upper shells. The upper bound for the energy
   fluctuations at mid-shell is shown to have the form sigma(A) approximate
   to 20 A(-1.34) MeV. This estimate is consistent with the mass errors
   found in large-shell model calculations along the N = 126 line, and with
   local mass error estimated using the Garvey-Kelson relations, all being
   smaller than 100keV. It agrees in both size and functional form with the
   fluctuations deduced independently from second-order perturbation
   theory.},

Title = {Novel method for aroma recovery from the bioconversion of lutein to

   material},
Journal = {APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this work, we report on the synthesis and ability of the mesoporous
   material MCM-41 to adsorb the norisoprenoid beta-ionone. This compound,
   with a violet aroma note, can be produced from lutein by the yeast
   Trichosporon asahii through a bioconversion process. We found that
   beta-ionone inhibited the yeast growth and constrained aroma formation.
   Growth inhibition was overcome using silicate MCM-41 as sorbent device
   in a fermentation system that allowed product removal from the culture
   medium by headspace manipulation. Compared to a commercial silica gel,
   the mesoporous material exhibited a 4.5-fold higher beta-ionone
   adsorption. Contrasting to cultures without the sorbent device, the
   presence of MCM-41 allowed a marked increase (14-fold) in beta-ionone
   production. Our results suggested that confinement of the norisoprenoid
   into the sorbent material bypassed its toxicity which allowed a better
   beta-ionone production. This study represents the first report on the
   use of MCM-41 to recover an aroma produced by fermentation and
   therefore, a novel application for a mesoporous material.},

Abstract = {An exact real-space renormalization method is developed to address the
   electronic transport in mirror Fibonacci chains at a macroscopic scale
   by means of the Kubo-Greenwood formula. The results show that the mirror
   symmetry induces a large number of transparent states in the dc
   conductivity spectra, contrary to the simple Fibonacci case. A length
   scaling analysis over ten orders of magnitude reveals the existence of
   critically localized states and their ac conduction spectra show a
   highly oscillating behaviour. For multidimensional quasiperiodic
   systems, a novel renormalization plus convolution method is proposed.
   This combined renormalization + convolution method has shown an
   extremely elevated computing efficiency, being able to calculate
   electrical conductance of a three-dimensional non-crystalline solid with
   1030 atoms. Finally, the dc and ac conductances of mirror Fibonacci
   nanowires are also investigated, where a quantized dc-conductance
   variation with the Fermi energy is found, as observed in gold nanowires.},

Abstract = {We explored a new approach to tracking population losses in poorly known
   species across broad spatial scales, based on integration of tools from
   ecological niche modeling with data resources derived from remotely
   sensed land-cover information. Ecological niches were modeled based on
   known occurrences of species (natural history museum specimen data) and
   environmental dimensions including topography, climate and original
   vegetation; these niche models were then projected onto land
   use/land-cover maps (with classes equivalent to those in the original
   vegetation dataset) based on air photography and LandSat imagery from
   1976, 1993 and 2000, to track loss of potential distributional area over
   two decades. As an illustration, we analyzed 11 endemic Corvidae (jays)
   in Mexico; the method is applicable to any species for which
   distributional information exists and any region for which multitemporal
   land-cover information has been developed. We envisage this approach
   evolving into a ``population loss meter{''}, permitting monitoring of
   losses of species-specific combinations of environmental and landscape
   features.},

Abstract = {Using a 216-atom amorphous periodic cubic supercell generated with the
   ab initio `undermelt-quench' procedure previously reported, we have
   undertaken the study of vibrational properties of pure amorphous
   silicon, a-Si, with a density of 2.33 g/cm(3). The radial distribution
   function obtained for the 216-atom random structure agrees with previous
   results for a 64-atom structure. For the density functional calculation
   the Harris-relaxed structure was used to obtain the vibrational modes.
   For the classical calculation the structure, obtained with the Harris
   functional, was relaxed using the Tersoff potential and the vibrational
   modes calculated. Both results agree very well with experiment
   indicating that our amorphous cell closely resembles the real material.

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {One of the factors leading to a decline in quality and productivity of
   certain plantations is the presence of parasitic plants. This study was
   conducted to determine the role played by peroxidase in the process of
   invasion of coffee stems by Cuscuta jalapensis. The ill situ activity of
   peroxidase during the phases of attachment and host penetration, was
   determined by histochemical tests. These tests indicate the activity of
   peroxidase in relation to morphological changes that take place, during
   the development of the haustorial cushion on the cell walls and vacuoles
   of the epidermal cells, and during the processes of disorganization of
   the tissue of Cuscuta stems and formation of the haustorium. The
   activity of peroxidase was shown to be associated with the processes of
   invasion and destruction of tissues of the host up until the moment when
   the haustorium makes contact with the vascular bundle. The activity of
   peroxidase in the cell walls of Cuscuta jalapensis is intimately
   associated to the morphogenesis of the adherence structures, as well as
   to the processes leading to the invasion of the host. We propose that
   this enzyme be included within the set of compounds elements needed to
   initiate an invasion of a host by a parasitic angiosperm. The
   information acquired gives significance to the probable participation of

Abstract = {Genetic variability of wild populations, closely related to domesticated
   species, constitute important genetic resources for plant breeding
   programs. In this paper, we analysed the variation of eight wild
   populations of Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme in a common garden
   experiment for levels of plant infestation by whitefly, leaf trichome
   density as a defensive character preventing infestation by whitefly, and
   the effect of whitefly incidence into vegetative and reproductive plant
   characters. Number of adults of whitefly was recorded in the eight wild
   populations of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, one population of the
   wild species S. habrochaites (C-360), and one of a cultivated variety of
   S. lycopersicum ( Rio Grande). There were significant differences among
   the wild populations of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme in the average
   level of whitefly incidence and trichome density. Cultivated tomatoes
   had the higher incidence of whiteflies ((x) over bar = 7.50 +/- 0.14)
   followed by plants of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme ((x) over bar =
   2.02 +/- 0.92) and plants of S. habrochaites with the lowest incidence
   ((x) over bar = 0.36 +/- 0.35). Whitefly incidence was negatively
   correlated with trichome density (r = - 0.38, p < 0.0001), suggesting
   that trichomes deter or limit the establishment of whiteflies.
   Additionally, a significant negative effect of whitefly incidence along
   the growing season upon plant growth rate ( number of branches and
   height) and fruit production was detected.},

   the interval of radiated frequencies and it alone cannot establish a

   it is possible to define a general lower bound for the velocity of the
   particle, which does not depend on the frequency when both, a specific
   response of the medium is taken into account and the mentioned condition
   is considered. The minimum value of the phase velocity of light in the
   medium determines the existence of such general lower bound.},

Abstract = {A systematic investigation of heavy charged particle-to-gamma
   thermoluminescent (TL) efficiencies has been performed for the total
   signal and peak 5 of LiF : Mg, Ti (TLD-100) dosemeters. Experimental and
   theoretical efficiencies are presented for protons as well as helium,
   carbon, nitrogen and oxygen ions. Proton, helium and carbon irradiations
   were performed at incident energies between 0.7 and 11 MeV. For nitrogen
   and oxygen, two energies, corresponding to `mirror' values below and
   above the Bragg peak energy, were used to measure TL efficiencies for
   the same linear energy transfer (LET) entrance value. The energies
   chosen were 4.83 and 9.95 MeV for nitrogen ions and 6.02 and 12.95 MeV
   for oxygen ions. Distinct curves are found for each ion species. Data
   for energies higher than the Bragg peak energy follow the well-known
   tendency, efficiency values decrease with increasing LET. Efficiencies
   measured below the Bragg peak display the opposite effect, efficiency
   increases with increasing LET. Presenting results as a function of
   incident energy shows a monotonic and single valued behaviour,
   efficiency decreases with decreasing energy. The measured efficiencies
   of the higher-energy data (above the Bragg peak) were found to be 1.45
   times greater than their low-energy counterparts. Modified track
   structure theory efficiency calculations were performed for all the ions
   investigated using radial dose distributions obtained via Monte Carlo
   simulations in solid-state LiF and 8.1 keV x-rays as test radiation. The
   theoretical values show agreement with data within 40\% for both peak 5
   and the total signal. The calculations predict the observed behaviour,
   higher efficiency for higher ion energy.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by fibroblast
   expansion and extracellular matrix accumulation. However, the mechanisms
   involved in matrix remodeling have not been elucidated. In this study,
   the authors aimed to evaluate the expression of the tissue inhibitors of
   matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in human fibroblasts and whole tissues
   from IPF and normal lungs. They also determined the role of
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in TIMP3 expression. TIMP1,
   TIMP2, and TIMP3 were highly expressed in lung fibroblasts. Transforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, a profibrotic mediator, induced strong
   up-regulation of TIMP3 at the mRNA and protein levels. The authors
   examined whether the MAPK pathway was involved in TGF-beta 1-induced
   TIMP3 expression. TGF-beta 1 induced the phosphorylation of p38 and
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Biochemical blockade of
   p38 by SB203580, but not of the ERK MAPK pathway, inhibited the effect
   of this factor. The effect was also blocked by the tyrosine kinase
   inhibitor genistein and by antagonizing TGF-beta 1 receptor type I
   (activin-linked kinase {[}ALK5]). In IPF tissues TIMP3 gene expression
   was significantly increased and the protein was localized to
   fibroblastic foci and extracellular matrix. Our findings suggest that
   TGF-beta 1-induced TIMP3 may be an important mediator in lung
   fibrogenesis.},

Abstract = {dentification of groups that are similar in their floristic composition
   and structure (habitat types) is essential for conservation and forest
   managers to allocate high priority areas and to designate areas for
   reserves, refuges, and other protected areas. In this study, the use of
   indigenous knowledge for the identification of habitat types in the
   field was compared against an ecological characterization of habitat
   types, including their species composition obtained by using
   classification and ordination techniques for a tropical landscape mosaic
   in a rural Mayan area of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Plant diversity data
   calculated from 141 sampled sites chosen randomly on a vegetation
   class's thematic map obtained by multispectral satellite image
   classification were used for this propose. Results indicated high
   similarity in the categorization of vegetation types between the Mayan

   correspondence analysis. This suggests that indigenous knowledge has a
   practical use and can be comparable to that obtained by using
   science-based methods. Finally, identification and mapping of vegetation
   classes (habitat types) using satellite image classification allowed us
   to discriminate significantly different species compositions, in such a
   way that they can provide a useful mechanism for interpolating diversity
   values over the entire landscape.},

Abstract = {Genotoxic carcinogens which interact with DNA may produce double-strand
   breaks as normal intermediates of homologous mitotic recombination, and
   may give rise to structural chromosome aberrations and inter-chromosomal
   deletion-recombination. The genotoxic profile of two inhibitors of DNA
   topoisomerases were evaluated using an in vivo somatic w/w(+), eye assay
   of Drosophila melanogaster for the detection of loss of heterozygosity
   (LOH) by homologous mitotic recombination, intra-chromosomal
   recombination and structural chromosomal aberrations. We studied
   camptothecin (CPT) as a topoisomerase-I-interactive agent and etoposide
   (ETOP) as a topoisomerase 11 inhibitor. These drugs act by stabilizing a
   ternary complex consisting of topoisomerases covalently linked to DNA at
   single-strand or at double-strand breaks, thereby preventing the
   relegation step of the breakage/rejoining reaction mediated by the
   enzyme. The genotoxic profiles were determined from the appearance of
   eye tissue in adult flies, in which LOH and expression of the reporter
   gene white produced light clones. The results demonstrated that both
   compounds were significantly genotoxic, with CPT being more effective
   than ETOP. Inter-chromosomal mitotic recombination was the major
   mechanism responsible for the induction of light spots by both compounds
   in XX females. Loss of the ring X chromosome (rX), was significantly
   enhanced by CPT, and this topoisomerase blocker also produced
   intra-chromosomal recombination (XY males). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We study the structure and energies of formation of antiphase defects on

   antiphase defect, the type first proposed by Hirsch (1980 J. Microsc.
   118 3) wholly inside the dislocation core, and another type that lies
   partly outside the core. Both types are stable and contain one atom
   which is threefold coordinated. Each of these atoms has a dangling
   hybrid which lies in a direction perpendicular to the dislocation line
   on the slip plane. We obtain values of 1.39 +/- 0.03 eV and 1.41 +/-
   0.03 eV for the average formation energy of single antiphase defects of
   the inside and outside types, respectively. We have obtained, using a
   tight binding scheme, bandstructures corresponding to these two types of
   defect, and we find both of them to be associated with states in the gap
   and each dangling hybrid to contain one electron.},

Title = {The other face of Lyell: historical biogeography in his Principles of
   geology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {549-559},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although some excellent articles about Lyell's work have been published,
   they do not explicitly deal with Lyell's biogeographical conceptions.
   The purpose of this paper is to analyse Lyell's biogeographical model in
   terms of its own internal structure. Lyell tried to explain the
   distribution of organisms by appealing to a real cause (climate).
   However, he was aware that environmental conditions were clearly
   insufficient to explain the existence of biogeographical regions.
   Lyell's adherence to ecological determinism generated strong tensions
   within his biogeographical model. He shifted from granting a secondary
   weight to dispersal to assigning it a major role. By doing so, Lyell was
   led into an evident contradiction. A permanent tension in Lyell's ideas
   was generated by the prevalent explanatory pattern of his time. The
   explanatory model based on laws did not produce satisfactory results in
   biology because it did not deal with historical processes. We may
   conclude that the knowledge of organic distribution interested Lyell as
   long as it could be explained by the uniformitarian principles of his
   geological system. The importance of the second volume of the Principles
   of geology lies in its ample and systematic argumentation about the
   geographical distribution of organisms. Lyell established, independently
   from any theory about organic change, the first version of dispersalist
   biogeography.},

Abstract = {The Sierra Madre sparrow Xenospiza baileyi, categorized as Endangered on
   the IUCN Red List, is endemic to Mexico. The subalpine bunch grasslands
   of the Transverse Volcanic Belt in the south of the Valley of Mexico are
   the last remaining habitat of this species. We conducted a detailed
   survey for the Sierra Madre sparrow using the point count method, and
   then described the species' habitat using a phytosociological approach.
   The two sets of information were pooled into a single analytical
   framework to identify priority habitats for the species. Eight
   vegetation communities were distinguished. The Festuca
   lugens-Muhlenbergia quadridentata and Stipa ichu bunch grassland
   communities had the highest densities of the Sierra Madre sparrow.
   Intensive burning and grazing activities and agricultural encroachment
   have restricted sparrow occupancy. Landscape analysis helped to
   delineate core grassland areas for the species and grassland strips and
   islands that could potentially act as habitat corridors. From the
   information generated in this study, which was shared with the local
   communities, we are establishing a participatory socioecological
   investigation for conservation of the Sierra Madre sparrow's habitat.},

Abstract = {Aim To test whether distributional patterns of Neotropical freshwater
   taxa fit the generalized tracks already postulated for terrestrial
   groups occurring in the Mexican Transition Zone.
   Location The study units comprised 17 hydrological basins located along
   the Pacific coast of the Americas from Mexico to Panama, and in the Gulf
   of Mexico from the Papaloapan to the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin.
   Methods Distributional data for 22 fish species, 34 crab species of the
   tribe Pseudothelphusini, and 22 strictly freshwater species of
   angiosperms were analysed. Parsimony analysis of endemicity is based on
   presence/absence data of these taxa and uses the computer programs
   Winclada and NONA.
   Results Three generalized tracks were obtained: (1) Mexican North
   Pacific, (2) Mexican Central Pacific, and (3) Southern Mexico-Guatemala.
   A node resulted at the intersection of the first two tracks, coinciding
   with the Neovolcanic Axis in central Mexico.
   Main conclusions Freshwater generalized tracks with an altitudinal
   distribution below 1000 m, mainly including fishes and angiosperms, are
   close to the Tropical Mesoamerican generalized track. Generalized tracks
   above 1000 m, including freshwater crabs, have a stronger affinity with
   the Mountain Mesoamerican track. The Isthmus of Tehuantepec represents a
   node for the Neotropical freshwater and terrestrial biota. These results
   seem to indicate that common geobiotic processes have induced these
   patterns.},

Volume = {267},

Abstract = {Ricinuleids are one of the least investigated groups of Arachnida. In
   particular, knowledge of their ultrastructure is poor. Observations of
   the distal tarsomeres of ricinuleids show differences in their shape and
   equipment of surface structures. Legs I and II are used by the Ricinulei
   to explore their surroundings with tentative movements. The tarsomeres
   of these legs show similarities in shape and surface structures that
   distinguish them from those of legs III and IV. In this study, 11
   different structures of the tarsomere surfaces of two cave-dwelling
   species, Pseudocellus pearsei and P. boneti from Mexico, were
   investigated for the first time with scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy and discussed regarding their possible function: 1) a single
   treelike ramifying seta resembles a no pore single-walled (np-sw)
   sensillum; 2) setae occurring in a small number and possessing a
   bipartite shaft represent terminal pore single-walled (tp-sw) sensilla.
   The surface of the proximal half of the shaft shows small branches. The
   distal half has a smooth surface; 3) long setae with conspicuous
   longitudinal lamellae show characteristics of chemoreceptive wall pore
   single-walled (wp-sw) sensilla; 4) frequent small wp-sw sensilla with
   flat and irregular lamellae; 5) very short wp-sw sensilla occurring
   solitary or in groups; 6) a few short setae with smooth surface
   correspond to wp-sw sensilla; 7) a single short clubbed seta
   articulating in a flat pit is considered to be a np-sw sensillum; 8)
   common long setae with a pointed tip show characteristics of
   mechanoreceptive np-sw sensilla; 9) ventral setae with adhesive and
   mechanosensory function are accompanied by multicellular ``class III{''}
   glands; 10) slit organs with mechanoreceptive function; and 11)
   dome-like tubercles with no indication of sensorial function. Several of
   these sensilla form a sensory field on the dorsofrontal surface which is
   particularly pronounced on the distal tarsomeres of legs I and II.},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {Analysis of the structure and physiology of the uterine incubation
   chambers of viviparous squamates has provided insight concerning
   adaptations for gestation. However, the literature addressing the
   biology of the interembryonic regions of the uterus is very limited,
   presumably because it has been assumed that this area has little role in
   the development and support of embryos in viviparous squamates. This
   study was undertaken to examine the histology of the interembryonic
   regions of Mabuya brachypoda, a viviparous lizard with microlecithal ova
   and consequently substantial matrotrophic activity. The incubation
   chambers are oval, distended zones of the uterus, adjacent to the
   interembryonic regions. The wall of the interembryonic regions includes:
   mucosa, formed by a cubodal or columnar epithelium with ciliated and
   nonciliated cells, and a lamina propria of vascularized connective
   tissue containing abundant acinar glands; myometrial smooth muscle
   consisting of inner circular and outer longitudinal layers; and serosa.
   The segment of the interembryonic region adjacent to the incubation
   chamber forms a transitional segment that displays folds of the mucosa
   that protrude into the uterine lumen. The limit of the incubation
   chamber is well defined by the long mucosal folds of the transitional
   segment. Long and thin extensions of extraembryonic membranes are
   present in the lumen of the transitional segment, outside of the
   incubation chamber region. The presence of abundant uterine glands and
   extraembryonic membranes in the interembryonic regions during gestation
   suggests uterine secretory activity and histotrophic transfer of
   nutrients to embryos in these regions.},

Abstract = {Job type is able to cause changes that could affect health. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the job activity influence on some
   atherogenic risk biochemical indicators in elderly people, who are
   exposed to higher risk due to ageing. Both sexes people from Corrientes,
   Chaco and Misiones provinces (60 to 92 years old, n = 320), were studied
   through a blocks design. Analysis of variance was performed by two-way
   linear model. General means obtained for plasmatic glucose (5.17 +/-
   0.71 mmol/L), fructosamine (332 50 mu mol/L), total cholesterol (5.64
   +/- 1.19 mmol/L), triglycerides (1.48 +/- 0.32 mmol/L) and beta
   lipoprotein (54.6 +/- 8.2\%) were higher than those obtained in the
   general population. On the other hand, alpha lipoprotein (34.5 +/-
   5.1\%) and pre-beta lipoprotein (10.9 +/- 2.3\%) remained within that
   reference interval. Atherogenic risk indicators were significantly lower
   in retired elderly people. Studied parameters were significantly
   influenced by occupation developed along life. Unfavorable lipid levels
   were found in sedentaty occupations, and high carbohydrate values were
   registered in high risk activities. Studied parameters remained more
   balanced in occupations that required high physical effort and low
   emotional tension. Results obtained in elderly people confirm that
   atherogenic risk indicators are affected by the job type.},

Abstract = {In crustaceans, neuroendocrine centers are located in different
   structures of the nervous system. One of these structures, the
   X-organ-sinus gland complex of the eyestalk, produces several
   neuropeptides that belong to the two main functionally different
   families: firstly, the chromatophorotropins, and secondly, a large
   family comprising various closely related peptides, commonly named
   CHH/MIH/GIH family. This review updates some aspects of the structural,
   biochemical and functional properties of the main hyperglycemic
   neuropeptide of this family, the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH).
   The first part of this work is a survey of the neuroendocrine system
   that produces the neurohormones of the CHH/MIH/GIH family, focusing on
   recent reports that propose new possible neuroendocrine loci of CHH
   production, secondly we revise general aspects of the CHH biochemical,
   and structural characteristics and thirdly, we present a review of the
   role of CHH in the regulation of several physiological processes of
   crustaceans as well as new reports on the ontogenetic aspects of CHH.
   The review is centered only on one group of malacostracan crustaceans,
   the Decapoda. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by
   fibroblast expansion and extracellular matrix accumulation. Some
   secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as MMP2 are highly upregulated
   in IPF lungs. Membrane-type (MT)-MMPs participate in the activation of
   pro-MMP2. However, they have not been examined in IPF. Methods: Type I
   transmembrane MT-MMPs, MT1, MT2, MT3, and MT5-MMP were analyzed by
   real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry in IPF and normal lungs. MMP-2
   was also immunolocalized and evaluated by gelatin zymography in BAL
   fluids. Additionally, the MT-MMPs were examined by real time PCR in lung
   fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-beta 1 and IFN-gamma. Results: MT1-MMP,
   was the most highly expressed followed by MT2- and MT5-MMP, and by a
   moderate expression of MT3-MMP. Regarding their localization, MT1- and
   MT2-MMPs were found in alveolar epithelial cells, MT3-MMP in fibroblasts
   from fibroblastic foci and alveolar epithelial cells and MT5-MMP in
   basal bronchiolar epithelial cells and in areas of squamous metaplasia.
   MMP2 was localized in alveolar and basal bronchiolar epithelial cells
   and fibroblasts, and increased active enzyme was observed in BAL fluids.
   In lung fibroblasts, TGF-beta 1 induced a strong upregulation of
   MT3-MMP, both at the gene and protein level. This effect was blocked by
   genistein, a protein tyrosin kinase inhibitor and partially repressed by
   SB203580 a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor. IFN-gamma had no effect.
   Conclusions: MT MMPs are expressed in IPF, in the same cell types as
   MMP2. Mostly by different types of epithelial cells a pivotal component
   in the aberrant remodeling of the lung microenvironment. Interestingly
   MT3-MMP that was found in fibroblastic foci was upregulated in vitro by
   TGF-beta 1 a potent profibrotic mediator.},

   First order abduction, however, has been viewed as intractable, for the
   undecidability of logical consequence. In this paper, we propose a

   the cardinality of the minimal model satisfying the given theory. We use
   a notion of restricted satisfaction, also relative to a domain
   cardinality. Finally, we propose an effective procedure for the
   searching of abductive solutions, by means of a modification of Beth's

Abstract = {Since cacti have very small surface/volume ratios, the amount of light
   they intercept is limited, and so is photosynthesis. However, many cacti
   shade themselves by means of dense hairy mats, called cephalia, which
   protect the floral buds. There is a trade-off between allocating a
   surface to photosynthesis or to the protection of reproductive
   structures. We found that proportion of the stem covered by cephalium
   affected fitness in the columnar cactus Lophocereus schottii. Too little
   cephalium holds few floral buds while too much reduces fecundity -
   probably through diminished photosynthesis - with an intermediate amount
   maximising reproduction. The optimal proportion of cephalium becomes
   smaller as the plant grows, probably because self-shading by new
   branches causes a further reduction in light interception. Smaller
   plants had significantly less cephalium than the optimal amount to
   maximise current reproduction. Since the largest individuals produced
   more reproductive structures, small cacti may find it more profitable to
   grow fast to achieve a large fecundity, than to assign resources to
   immediate reproduction via cephalium development.},

Abstract = {Population modeling based on species' demography makes it possible to
   predict the pace of an invasion and evaluate the likelihood of success
   of different control strategies. We modeled the initial
   (density-independent) rate of increase of Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C.
   Agardh (aquarium strain), a green alga that has markedly altered marine
   communities where it has invaded in the Mediterranean Sea. Parameter
   values for patch growth (from stolon extension) and reproduction (by
   asexual fragmentation and reattachment) were gleaned from published
   studies. Only the most conservative model, invoking field growth rates
   and low levels of fragment reattachment (2.5 m(-2) of existing patch
   each summer), closely matched observed increases (4-14 x annually). The
   most effective times for control (greatest reduction in rate of
   increase) were removal of established patches before summer and removal
   of fragments after summer. These times correspond to just before maximum
   growth and just after maximum reproduction, respectively. Only a
   combined strategy, incorporating 99\% removal of all fragments and
   annual removal of 99\% of established patches, was predicted to
   eliminate C. taxifolia entirely (lambda < 1). This level of effort is
   only likely to be possible during the first few years of an invasion,
   arguing strongly for careful monitoring and rapid response to potential
   high-impact invaders.},

Abstract = {An updated checklist of the benthic amphipods associated with soft
   bottoms in the SW Gulf of Mexico has been made and the areas of endemism
   have been identified. Amphipods were collected in a depth interval of 25
   to 3700 in during six cruises from 1994 to 1999. A total number of 56
   species were identified, 11 belonging to the suborder Caprellidea and 45
   to the suborder Gammaridea. Thirteen species extended their geographical
   distribution within the Gulf of Mexico and four species were considered
   new records in the Gulf of Mexico. A biogeographic analysis based on the
   shared species and the parsimony criterion helped identify three areas
   of endemism in the SW Gulf of Mexico. They were rallied: area A, a small
   area oil the continental shelf of the Bay of Campeche; area B, the
   continental slope of the Bay of Campeche and area C, the lower
   continental slope of the Mexican ridges extending into the western
   Sigsbee abyssal plain. These areas are defined ill terms of their
   complex topography that may help isolate habitats that promote
   endemicity.},

Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Traditional mycological knowledge of most Mexican ethnic groups has
   proven to be extensive and profound, consuming nearly 300 species of
   wild mushrooms. In this paper, we identified the mushrooms used by
   Zapotecs of Ixtlan, Oaxaca, compiled their traditional knowledge and
   analyzed their relation to macro-fungal diversity and usage. We
   collected mushrooms and conducted ethnomycological research between 2000
   and 2003. We used participant observation and applied 50 interviews and
   47 questionnaires to a randomly selected sample pool of local
   informants. Forty-three mushroom taxa had local anthropocentric interest
   and corresponded to 26 folk species. Thirty-seven taxa were wild
   edibles, three were cultivated edibles, two toxic and one had
   recreational use. Wild edible taxa represented 38.54\% of useful species
   recorded in the zone. Taxa belonged to 19 families, with Pluteaceae
   being the most represented with six species, followed by Hydnaceae and
   Hydnangiaceae with five. From the 20 genera represented, Amanita had six
   species and Hydnum and Laccaria had five. Informants knew aspects of
   fungal nature and life-cycle, substrates, habitats and ecological
   relations of mushrooms with plants. Edible fungi were the most used
   non-timber forest resource, with 65.96\% of informants reported to
   collect them. On average, interviewees consumed mushrooms 3.04 days a
   month. Everyone had access to mushrooms independently of age, sex or
   occupation. The mechanisms involved in the mushroom appropriation
   process were gathering, purchasing and reciprocal gifts. The mushroom
   exploitation was composed of different gathering strategies: casual or
   intentional and randomly or directed. We also found inside-forest
   promotion of Tricholoma magnivelare development, and outside-forest
   semi-culture of Neolentinus lepideus. These people use macro-fungal
   diversity, mainly for food, in an integrated subsistence system that
   joins modern and traditional practices.},

Abstract = {In an attempt to know how the protein level modulates catabolism and its
   effects on the immune response, we studied juvenile L. vannamei that had
   been starved for varying period after being conditioned on diet
   containing either maintenance or optimal dietary protein levels (DPL).
   The effect of dietary protein level on nutritional reserves management
   of shrimp and its relation with immune condition was also addressed.
   Juvenile shrimp were fed for 21 days on diets containing 5\% and 40\%
   dietary protein. Hemolymph metabolites (glucose, cholesterol, protein,
   acylglycerols, and lactate), hemocyanin, osmoregulatory capacity,
   digestive gland glycogen and lipids, and immune conditions (hemocytes
   characterization, phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst: basal and
   activated) were evaluated and considered as initial condition. After
   that time, shrimp were starved for 21 days. During starvation time every
   7 days nutritional, physiological and immunological condition were
   evaluated. A reduction in all physiological and immunological indicators
   was observed with starvation. The protein level of the conditioning diet
   had a significant effect on this response; generally, the effect was
   smaller with shrimp previously fed 40\% dietary protein. In this sense
   the present results demonstrate that shrimp are well adapted to tolerate
   food deprivation for some time but that this tolerance is closely
   related to its previous nutritional condition. In the case of shrimp fed
   40\% DPL, wet weight, nutritional and immune condition was significantly
   affected after 14 days of starvation. In shrimp previously fed 5\% DP,
   tolerance to starving condition was limited to only a few days (7 days)
   as a result of low reserves of circulatory and mussel proteins. All
   these results demonstrate that dietary protein levels can governor the
   immune condition of shrimp through the management reserves metabolism,
   indicating that a shrimp with a good nutritional condition can tolerate
   until 14 days without modifying the evaluated immune responses. In this
   sense it can be concluded that protein metabolism have a central role
   for shrimp. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical studies of an intra-nuclear
   particle, the perichromatin granule (PCG), demonstrated the presence of
   processed mRNA in this structure. Ovariectomy caused an increase in the
   number of PCGs in uterine cells and administration of estradiol
   drastically reduced the nuclear pool of PCGs in 15 min. In vitro studies
   demonstrated that this depletion was accompanied by an increase of the
   export of previously synthesized RNA. Similar quantitative changes of
   the abundance of PCG and of the rate of the export of RNA were found in
   ventral prostate after orchiectomy and testosterone restitution, as well
   as in the target cells of FSH, LH, TSH, and ACTH. These results taken
   together led us to conclude that PCGs constitute an intra-nuclear
   compartment of a few processed mRNA in equilibrium with transcription
   and export. This mRNA is rapidly transferred to the cytoplasm by
   specific hormone signals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Pollen - pistil interactions are crucial for controlling plant mating.
   For example, S-RNase-based self-incompatibility prevents inbreeding in
   diverse angiosperm species. S-RNases are thought to function as specific
   cytotoxins that inhibit pollen that has an S-haplotype that matches one
   of those in the pistil. Thus, pollen and pistil factors interact to
   prevent mating between closely related individuals. Other pistil
   factors, such as HT-B, 4936-factor and the 120 kDa glycoprotein, are
   also required for pollen rejection but do not contribute to
   S-haplotype-specificity per se. Here we show that S-RNase is taken up
   and sorted to a vacuolar compartment in the pollen tubes. Antibodies to
   the 120 kDa glycoprotein label the compartment membrane. When the pistil
   does not express HT-B or 4936-factor, S-RNase remains sequestered,
   unable to cause rejection. Similarly, in wild-type pistils, compatible
   pollen tubes degrade HT-B and sequester S-RNase. We suggest that S-RNase
   trafficking and the stability of HT-B are central to S-specific pollen
   rejection.},

Title = {A novel thioredoxin h is secreted in Nicotiana alata and

Abstract = {Thioredoxins type h are classified into three subgroups. The subgroup II
   includes thioredoxins containing an N-terminal extension, the role of
   which is still unclear. Although thioredoxin secretion has been observed
   in animal cells, there is no evidence suggesting that any thioredoxin h
   is secreted in plants. In this study, we report that a thioredoxin h,
   subgroup II, from Nicotiana alata (NaTrxh) is secreted into the
   extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tract tissue.
   Fractionation studies showed that NaTrxh is extracted along with well
   characterized secretion proteins such as S-RNases and NaTTS (N. alata
   transmitting tissue-specific protein). Moreover, an NaTrxh-green
   fluorescent fusion protein transiently expressed in Nicotiana
   benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was also secreted, showing
   that NaTrxh has the required information for its secretion. We performed
   reduction assays in vitro to identify potential extracellular targets of
   NaTrxh. We found that S-RNase is one of the several potential substrates
   of the NaTrxh in the extracellular matrix. In addition, we proved by
   affinity chromatography that NaTrxh specifically interacts with S-RNase.
   Our findings showed that NaTrxh is a new thioredoxin h in Nicotiana that
   is secreted as well as in animal systems. Because NaTrxh is localized in
   the extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tract and its
   specific interaction with S-RNase to reduce it in vitro, we suggest that
   this thioredoxin h may be involved either in general pollen-pistil
   interaction processes or particularly in S-RNase-based
   self-incompatibility.},

Abstract = {The huge biodiversity found in Mesoamerica, is often explained by its
   geographic situation as a natural bridge between two large biogeographic
   regions. Often overlooked, however, are the high levels of speciation
   and diversification in the area. Here we assess the phylogenetic
   relationships within a Mesoamerican group of hummingbirds (Lampornis).
   We sequenced both mtDNA (1143 bp of cyt b and 727 bp of ND5) and nuclear
   genes (505 bp of AK-5 intron and 567 bp of c-mos) for each of the seven
   recognised species and outgroups. We find two or three clades of similar
   age within this genus: L. clemenciae and L. amethystinus (singly or as
   each other's sister taxa) and a Central American clude. This
   Central-American clade presents a clear bipartition between northern (L.
   viridipallens and L. sybillae) and southern Mesoamerica, which is shared
   with many other Mesoamerican organisms. Our analyses suggest that L.
   hemileueus does not belong in the genus Lampornis. While we refrain to
   apply a time-scale to our data because of the lack of an appropriate
   calibration, our results indicate that the genus Lampornis predates the
   uprising of the Panama land-bridge, and that diversification among the
   isthmian species (L. castaneoventris and L. calolaema) is a very recent
   event. Our results strongly suggest a local Mesoamerican origin for this
   genus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   reduction of the Kohn anomaly. This anisotropy loss is also found in the

Abstract = {Fifty-three species have been formally described in Chone Kroyer, 1856,
   showing wide variation in the shapes of dorsal lips, peristomium, and
   posterior abdominal uncini. Previous studies indicate that such
   variation could result in splitting of the genus; however, the original
   description of the type species, C. infundibuliformis did not include
   critical details and illustrations, and for other species, incomplete or
   misleading information has been provided. In order to redescribe the
   species C. infundibuliformis and delineate the genus, type and topotype
   materials were reviewed, and histological sections of the appendages of
   the branchial crown, collar and glandular ridge are described. The
   redescription points out that in C. infundibuliformis: 1) insertion of
   the branchial lobes is not exposed beyond the collar; 2) radioles have a
   paired series of pinnules of different sizes; 3) radiolar flanges are

Abstract = {Rationale: Many of the interstitial lung diseases represent a diagnostic
   and therapeutic challenge because their clinical and even histologic
   features are often nonspecific. Likewise, the transcriptional signatures
   of most of them are unknown.
   Objective: To compare the gene expression patterns from patients with
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP),
   and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) using custom
   oligonucleotide microarrays.
   Methods: We profiled lung biopsies from 15 patients with IPF, 12 with
   HP, and eight with NSIP. Labeled complementary ribonucleic acid was
   hybridized to a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA microarray using
   standard Affymetrix protocols. The custom array, Hu03, contained 59,619
   probe sets representing an estimated 46,000 gene clusters.
   Results: We identified statistically significant gene expression
   signatures that characterize HP and IPF. The HP gene expression
   signature was enriched for genes that are functionally associated with
   inflammation, T-cell activation, and immune responses, whereas the IPF
   signature was characterized by the expression of tissue remodeling,
   epithelial, and myofibroblast genes. We then compared these gene
   expression signatures to classify NSIP, a histologic pattern that is
   often difficult to differentiate consistently from HP and IPF. Two cases
   exhibited an IPF-like gene expression, another one could be more
   properly classified as HP, whereas others did not resemble HP or IPF,
   suggesting that they may represent idiopathic NSIP.
   Conclusions: Our results underscore the value of gene expression
   signatures to classify the interstitial lung diseases and to understand
   pathogenic mechanisms, and suggest new ways to improve the diagnosis and
   treatment of patients with these diseases.},

Abstract = {Shell model calculations have been carried Out using the m-scheme
   numerical code ANTOINE in order to elucidate the particular trend of the
   isoscalar matrix elements, M-0, for A = 4n + 2 isobaric triplets ranging
   from A = 18 to A = 42. The 2(1)(+) (T = 1) -> 0(1)(+) (T = 1) transition
   energies, reduced transition probabil ities and isoscalar matrix
   elements are predicted to a high degree of accuracy. The general
   agreement of M-0 between those from mirror pairs and those from T-Z = 0
   nuclides support our shell model calculations, The predicted results tic
   together recent experimental data, and the trend of M-0 strength along
   the sd and beginning of the fp shells is interpreted in terms of the
   dynamic shell structure. Certain discrepancies arise at A = 18 and A =
   38 isobaric triplets, which might be explained in terms of core
   polarization effects and the low occupancy of the orbits at the extremes
   of the sd shell. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have constituted a consortium of key laboratories at the National
   Autonomous University of Mexico to carry out a genomic project for
   Taenia solium. This project will provide powerful resources for the
   study of taeniasis/cysticercosis, and, in conjunction with the
   Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis genome project
   of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), will mark the advent of genomics for
   cestode parasites. Our project is planned in two consecutive stages. The
   first stage is being carried out to determine some basic parameters of
   the T solium genome. Afterwards, we will evaluate the best strategy for
   the second stage, a full blown genome project, We have estimated the T
   solium genome size by two different approaches: cytofluorometry on
   isolated cyton nuclei, as well as a probabilistic calculation based on
   similar to 2000 sequenced genomic clones, similar to 3000 ESTs,
   resulting in size estimates of 270 and 251 Mb, respectively. In terms of
   sequencing, our goal for the first stage is to characterize several
   thousand EST's (from adult worm and cysticerci cDNA libraries) and
   genomic clones. Results obtained so far from about 16,000 sequenced ESTs
   from the adult stage, show that only about 40\% of the T solium coding
   sequences have a previously sequenced homologue. Many of the best hits
   are found with mammalian genes, especially with humans. However, 1.5\%
   of the hits lack homologues in humans, making these genes immediate
   candidates for investigation on pharmaco-therapy, diagnostics and
   vaccination. Most T solium ESTs are related to gene regulation, and
   signal transduction. Other important functions are housekeeping,
   metabolism, cell division, cytoskeleton, proteases, vacuolar transport,
   hormone response, and extracellular matrix activities. Preliminary
   results also suggest that the genome of T solium is not highly
   repetitive. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The enigmatic monocotyledon family Triuridaceae is composed of
   inconspicuous mycoheterotrophs, that have been variously interpreted. We
   present here the first report of a thorough floral developmental series
   for any member of the Triuridaceae. The two known Mexican Triuridaceae
   species were studied with anatomical sections and scanning electron
   microscopy. While both species have ephemeral and reduced radially
   symmetric flowers arising in a counterclockwise spiral on racemose
   inflorescences, Lacandonia schismatica is hermaphroditic with a central
   androecium and Triuris brevistylis is dioecious. Tepals are connately
   fused at their bases, and during development the subapical caudal tips
   continue to elongate, while at maturity the tepals are reflexed. Carpel
   primordia develop centrifugally from compound primordia in both species,
   with contrasting androecium development. In Lacandonia schismatica
   stamen and carpel primordia arise from a common precursor. The two
   species differ in tepal and carpel number and timing of organ
   development. This paper provides a developmental framework to understand
   floral characters in the Triuridaceae. Notably, we addressed if L.
   schismatica and T. brevistylis bear true flowers or pseudanthia, and our
   data support the former. The role of particular genes in determining the
   floral developmental patterns studied and the evolutionary significance
   of these patterns are discussed.},

Abstract = {This work presents data and calculations of (HCP)-to-gamma TLD-100
   thermoluminescent efficiencies. Dosemeters were irradiated with low
   energy hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen ions. For nitrogen
   and oxygen two energies, corresponding to ``mirror{''} values below and
   above the Bragg peak energy, were used to measure TL efficiencies for
   the same linear energy transfer (LET) entrance value. Efficiency
   results, both as a function of LET and energy, show distinct curves for
   each ion species. For energies above the Bragg peak energy, measurements
   show the well known tendency, efficiency values decrease with increasing
   LET. Data for energies lower than the Bragg peak display the opposite,
   efficiency increases with increasing LET. Results presented as a
   function of incident energy show that efficiency decreases with
   decreasing energy. For nitrogen and oxygen ions, the ``mirror{''}
   measurements at higher energy (above the Bragg peak) are found to be
   1.45 times greater than their low energy counterparts. Theoretical
   predictions based on Modified Track Structure Theory (MTST) show
   agreement with data within 40\% and predict the observed behavior,
   higher efficiency for higher ion energy.},

Title = {Zooplankton and the oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific:: A
   review},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2-4},
Pages = {318-359},
Abstract = {We review the spatial and temporal patterns of zooplankton in the
   eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and relationships with oceanographic
   factors that affect zooplankton distribution, abundance and trophic
   relationships. Large-scale spatial patterns of some zooplankton groups
   show broad coincidence with surface water masses, circulation, and
   upwelling regions, in agreement with an ecological and dynamic
   partitioning of the pelagic ecosystem. The papers reviewed and a new
   compilation of zooplankton volume data at large-scale show that
   abundance patterns of zooplankton biomass have their highest values in
   the upwelling regions, including the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the Costa Rica
   Dome, the equatorial cold tongue, and the coast of Peru.
   Some of the first studies of zooplankton vertical distribution were done
   in this region, and a general review of the topic is presented. The
   possible physiological implications of vertical migration in zooplankton
   and the main hypotheses are described, with remarks on the importance of
   the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) as a barrier to both the vertical
   distribution and migration of zooplankton in the region. Recent results,
   using multiple-net gear, show that vertical distribution is more complex
   than previously thought. There are some well-adapted species that do
   live and migrate within the OMZ. Temporal patterns are reviewed and
   summarized with historical data. Seasonal variations in zooplankton
   biomass follow productivity cycles in upwelling areas. No zooplankton
   time series exist to resolve ENSO effects in oceanic regions, but some
   El Nino events have had effects in the Peru Current ecosystem.
   Multidecadal periods of up to 50 years show a shift from a warm sardine
   regime with a low zooplankton biomass to a cool anchovy regime in the
   eastern Pacific with higher zooplankton biomasses. However, zooplankton
   volume off Peru has remained at low values since the 1972 El Nino, a
   trend opposite to that of anchoveta biomass since 1984.
   Studies of trophic relations emphasize the difference in the
   productivity cycle in the eastern tropical Pacific compared to temperate
   or polar ecosystems, with no particular peaks in the stocks of either
   zooplankton or phytoplankton. Productivity is more dependent on local
   events like coastal upwelling or water circulation, especially in the
   equatorial countercurrent Up to 70\% of the daily primary productivity
   is consumed by microzooplankton, which thus regulates the phytoplankton
   stocks. Micrograzers are an important link between primary producers,
   including bacteria, and mesozooplankton, constituting up to 80\% of
   mesozooplankton food. Oceanography affects zooplankton trophic
   relationships through spatial-temporal effects on primary productivity
   and on the distributions of metabolic factors, food organisms, and
   predators. This paper is part of a comprehensive review of the
   oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Amorphous and nanostructured SiO2:DR1 sol-gel films were prepared by
   dip-coating. X-ray diffraction studies were performed to determine the
   long-order structure obtained in the films. The optical absorption (AO)
   measurements were done in three different nanostructures of the SiO2
   network: lamellar, hexagonal and mixed. The AO measurements and the
   second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity were carried out at different
   orientation steps of the chromophores embedded in the films. These
   chromophore orientation distributions were obtained by means of the
   corona technique, and they depend on the corona poling time. We
   physically model the optical absorption and the second harmonic
   generation experimental results as function of the corona. poling time,
   employing only one fitting parameter related to the matrix-chromophore
   interactions. The physical model and the experimental results were in an
   excellent agreement. The experimental results fitted by the model are
   shown in plots of order parameter against corona poling time and SHG
   intensity against corona poling time. The lamellar structure provides a
   larger order parameter values than those obtained for the other
   structures. A minimum value for the order parameter was detected by
   means of the optical absorption measurements at short poling times. For
   the SHG measurements, four different chromophore concentrations were
   used. As the concentration increases the measured SHG intensity
   increases too, but the increment is limited by the electrostatic
   interactions among the chromophores, which is also considered in our
   model.},

   proved to be extremely hard to model and predict. These contain the
   information related with shell closures, nuclear deformations, and the
   residual nuclear interactions. In the present work the more than 2000
   known nuclear masses are studied as an array in the N-Z plane viewed
   through a mask, behind which are hidden the unknown 7000 unstable nuclei
   that can exist between the proton and neutron drip lines. Employing a
   Fourier transform deconvolution method these masses are predicted.
   Measured masses are reconstructed with and r.m.s. error of less than 200
   keV. The existence of an island of stability around (Z approximate to
   116, N approximate to 194) is strongly suggested. Different potential
   applications of the present approach are outlined.},

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS GEOLOGICAS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {199-214},
Abstract = {The flow and distribution of fluids through pores in porous media are
   governed by their geometry. The self-similar behavior of the structure
   of these sets has been the subject of numerous studies that have
   documented the power laws relationship, among the principal measures of
   pores and solids, and the resolution of the method used for their
   analysis. A fractal scheme is introduced in order to extract and measure
   some geometric features of pores, using the mean values of their fractal
   classifiers, dividing these in global (firmagram) and local (reference
   line) classifiers. The mass fractal dimension (D-m), the spectral
   dimension or fracton ((d) over bar), the Hurst exponent (H) and the
   lacunarity (Lambda) of naturally fractured reservoirs (YNF) of
   southeastern Mexico, have shown to be statistically different for the
   three most representative porosity sets:fractures, cavities and mixed
   porosity. The fractal classifiers, extracted from digital images
   obtained using X-ray computerized tomography, were useful for porosity
   classification in different patterns, starting from the core images. D-m
   and (d) over bar must be determined on presegmented images, which
   distinguish the pore and solid sets, prior to the fractal
   quantification, while H and Lambda can be extracted from the original
   image, which drastically diminishes the bias in the porosity estimation.
   All fractal classifiers, including mass dimensions and lacunarity of the
   porosity patterns specified above for YNF showed a statistically
   significant correlation with the porosity of the geological strata as
   determined by traditional techniques. All our results offer new
   perspectives for the modeling and forecasting of porosity in the
   naturally fractured deposits.},

   (BMU) affects other neurons, through the learning rule, as a function of

   neurons are not only affected by BMU as a function of distance, but as a
   function of the frequency of activation from both, the BMU and input
   vectors, to the affected neurons. This frequency parameter allows non
   radial neighborhoods and the quality of the formed maps is improved with
   respect to those formed by traditional SOM, as we show by comparing
   several error measures and five data sets.},

Abstract = {A careful determination of the lifetime and measurement of the branching
   ratio for decay of the first 2(T)(=1)(+) state in Sc-42 has allowed an
   accurate experimental test of charge independence in the A = 42 isobaric
   triplet. A lifetime of 69(17) fs was measured at the University of
   Kentucky, while relative intensities for the 975 keV and 1586 keV
   transitions depopulating the first 2(T)(=1)(+) 1 state have been
   determined at the University of Cologne as 100(1) and 8(1),
   respectively. Both measurements give an isoscalar matrix element, M-0,
   of 6.4(9) (W.u.) 1/2. This result confirms charge independence for the
   A=42 isobaric triplet. Shell model calculations have been carried out
   for understanding the global trend of Mo values for A = 4n + 2 isobaric
   triplets ranging from A = 18 to A = 42. The 2(1)((T=1))(+)->
   0(1)((T=1))(+) transition energies, reduced transition probabilities and
   M-0 values are reproduced to a high degree of accuracy. The trend of MO
   strength along the sd shell is interpreted in terms of the shell
   structure. Certain discrepancies arise at the extremes of the sd shell,
   for the A = 18 and A = 38 isobaric triplets, which might be explained in
   terms of the low valence space at the extremes of the sd shell.},

   the historical and institutional reforms of the 1990s best explain the
   gradual and constant increase in this trend. Not all institutional
   reforms, however, have the same effects on the election of women. Laws
   that clearly establish gender quota for legislative candidacies have the
   strongest effects. This paper uses fixed effects longitudinal regression
   models to test several hypotheses against Mexican legislative results
   from 1) 18 federal elections between 1952 and 2003 and 2) 154
   subnational elections between 1991 and 2005 in 31 states and the Federal
   District.},

Title = {Process and dynamics of traditional selling wild edible mushrooms in
   tropical Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Background: More than twelve temperate-inhabitant Mexican ethnic groups
   are considered to be mycophilic and to have extensive traditional
   mycological knowledge. In contrast, inhabitants of tropical lands have
   been studied only superficially and their mycological knowledge is less
   well known. In this paper, we report the results of an ethnomycological
   research in markets of a wide area of the Mexican tropics. Our aims were
   to describe the dynamics related to the traditional selling process of
   wild mushrooms and to determine the tendencies of informants toward
   mushrooms (mycophily vs. mycophoby).
   Methods: We visited 25 markets of 12 different settlements in the states
   of Oaxaca, Tabasco and Veracruz and collected information by participant
   observation as well as by 291 non-structured and semi-structured
   interviews.
   Results: Mushroom selling was observed in four towns in Oaxaca and in
   two in Tabasco. Women represented 81.82\% of sellers, while indigenous
   people (Chinantecos, Chontales, Ch'oles and Zoques) comprised 68.18\%.
   Mushroom commercialization took place in secondary mobile markets and
   only in peasant stands. Mushroom collectors gather the resource in
   places with secondary vegetation, farmed areas and cattle fields.
   Because of land tenure restrictions mushroom sellers did not normally
   collect mushrooms themselves. In Oaxaca, we observed economic dynamics
   not based on capitalism, such as exchange, reciprocity and barter.
   Conclusion: The sale of some wild edible mushrooms, the large amounts of
   commercialization of Schizophyllum commune, the complicated intermediary
   process, as well as the insertion of mushrooms into different informal
   economic practices are all evidence of an existent mycophily in a sector
   of the population of this region of the Mexican tropics. Among our
   informants, urban mestizo people were mycophobic, rural mestizo people
   were non-mycophilic and indigenous people were true mycophilic.},

Abstract = {In this work the behaviour of calcium manganese doped NaCl single
   crystals under gamma irradiation is reported. Various single crystals of
   NaCl doped with Ca and Mn have been irradiated at different doses with
   ionising radiation. The production of defects has been correlated to the
   increase in the intensity of the thermo luminescent glow curve as a
   function of doses. The glow curves intensity as a function of doses
   shows the potential use of these materials as dosimeters. Optical
   properties of such crystals after irradiation with gamma rays have also
   been studied; results have shown their potentiality as a good detector
   and optical store memory devices. Since the creations of colour centres
   by photons with energy less than the band gap energy has been detected
   also in ns(2)-ion doped alkali halides. (c) 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Abstract = {The new species Cupiennius chapanensis is described from a mangrove
   forest in the coastal regions of Chiapas, Mexico. The most noticeable
   characteristic of the species is the bright red coloration of the
   chelicerae, given by a covering of long setae on the anterior surface;
   because of this coloration, it has been previously confused with
   Phoneutria fera Perty 1833. It is generally similar to Cupiennius getazi
   Simon 1891, but lacks the spotted pattern on the ventral surface of the
   femora, together with other differences in genitalic morphology.
   Cupiennius salei Keyserling 1877 was also found on the same forest
   during the wet season, while C. chiapanensis appeared in the dry season.
   Adults of both species were never collected at the same time. This is
   also the first record of C. salei at the sea level, being previously
   considered a highland species.},

Abstract = {Epistemic logic allows to reason not only about situations, but also
   about the knowledge that a set of agents have about situations. In later
   years, epistemic logic has been applied to study the role of knowledge
   in games and negotiations. The classical approach, the mathematical
   theory of games, does not facilitate explicit reasoning about the
   knowledge of the agents that interact in competitive situations.
   Dynamic epistemic logic has been used recently to provide formal methods
   to analyze how the knowledge of a set of agents changes as a consequence
   of actions. In this paper we develop a logical language for reasoning
   about the knowledge that flows during a match of dominoes; we call this
   language dynamic epistemic logical language for dominoes. Syntax of the
   language has been presented in a previous work. We define here a formal
   semantics for the epistemic part of our language.},

Abstract = {The effect of six isocaloric diets with different protein (10\%, 20\%
   and 30\%) and lipids (6\% and 12\%) contents was evaluated on growth and
   maturation of male and female juvenile P. llamasi crayfish. The
   experiment was carried out using individual plastic chambers within a
   closed, recirculating system with constant temperature. After 90 days,
   specific growth rate (SGR) values were generally low for both sexes.
   Lowest SGR for females was 0.4 with diet D1 (10/6) and highest was 0.7
   with diet D4 (20/12). The lowest SGR for males was 0.3 with diet D1
   (10/6) and the highest was 0.6 with diet D4 (20/12). Feed conversion
   ratio (FCR) varied from 1.1 to 1.8, and survival was generally high (>
   80\%) for both sexes. The Maturation Index (MI) behaved in a similar way
   to the Gonadosomatic Index (GI), manifesting a close relationship with
   dietary protein and lipids contents. Diet had a significant effect on
   maturation in females. The effect of protein and lipids content was
   significant with a direct relationship between these values and the MI
   and GI. Diets with the highest protein content had the best GI and MI
   values and all diets with 12\% lipids had better MI and GI values than
   diets with 6\%. Unlike the growth performance, the best maturation
   results were produced by the 30/12 diet. Based on the different observed
   effects of the diets on growth and maturation, it is recommended the use
   of a 20/12 diet for growth and a 30/12 diet for maturation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {We consider the free energies of the single-period (SP) and
   double-period (DP) core reconstructions of the straight 90 degrees
   partial dislocation in silicon. The vibrational contributions are
   calculated with a harmonic model. It is found that it leads to a
   diminishing difference between the free energies of the two core
   reconstructions with increasing temperature. The question of the
   relative populations of SP and DP reconstructions in a single straight
   90 degrees partial dislocation is solved by mapping the problem onto a
   one-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field. The model contains only
   two parameters and is solved analytically. It leads to the conclusion
   that for the majority of the published energy differences between the SP
   and DP reconstructions the equilibrium core structure is dominated by
   the DP reconstruction at all temperatures up to the melting point. We
   review whether it is possible to distinguish between the SP and DP
   reconstructions experimentally, both in principle and in practice. We
   conclude that aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy
   should be able to distinguish between these two core reconstructions,
   but published high resolution micrographs do not allow the distinction
   to be made.},

   equivariant absolute neighborhood extensors (G-ANE's) in the category of
   all proper G-spaces that are metrizable by a G-invariant metric. We
   prove that if a proper G-space X is a G-ANE (respectively, a G-ANE(n), n
   >= 0), and H a closed normal subgroup of G such that all the H-orbits in
   X are metrizable, then the H-orbit space X/H is a G/H-ANE (respectively,
   a G/H-ANE(n)). Other related results are also established. (c) 2005

Abstract = {Twenty completely sequenced cellular genomes from the three major
   domains were analyzed using twice one-way BLAST searches in order to
   define the set of the most conserved protein-encoding sequences to
   characterize the gene complement of the last common ancestor of extant
   life. The resulting set is dominated by different putative ATPases, and
   by molecules involved in gene expression and RNA metabolism. DEAD-type
   RNA helicase and enolase genes, which are known to be part of the RNA
   degradosome, are as conserved as many transcription and translation
   genes. This suggests the early evolution of a control mechanism for gene
   expression at the RNA level, providing additional support to the
   hypothesis that during early cellular evolution RNA molecules played a
   more prominent role. Conserved sequences related to biosynthetic
   pathways include those encoding putative phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
   synthase and thioredoxin, which participate in nucleotide metabolism.
   Although the information contained in the available databases
   corresponds only to a minor portion of biological diversity, the
   sequences reported here are likely to be part of an essential and highly
   conserved pool of proteins domains common to all organisms.},

Abstract = {Differential and total cross sections for the production of N+ fragment
   formed by the collision of N-2(+) on He and Ar, at projectile energies
   between 1.0 and 5.0 keV and for scattering angles from -4 degrees to 4
   degrees are reported. The replotting of the angular distributions in
   terms of the scaled variable V-0 theta(2) as a function of (1/V-0)(d
   sigma/d Omega), indicates the same scaling law is followed in all the
   study. The reduced differential cross sections show an overall increase
   of at least one order of magnitude and a monotonic decreasing behavior
   at all the collision energies studied in this work. The cross sections
   for the N-2(+)-He system are found to be in the range of 0.85-1.60
   angstrom(2), while for the N-2(+)-Ar system are between 2.40 and 3.90
   angstrom(2). Both measured total cross sections for N+ formation display
   a slowly increasing behavior as a function of the incident energy. The
   absolute cross sections for DE (sigma(DE)) and DI (sigma(DI)) were
   estimated. Both cross sections for the He and Ar targets show the same
   behavior, with those for the Ar target slightly higher than those for
   the He target, while the DE process for both targets is a factor of 1.86
   higher than that for DI. The measurements reported here are not found in
   the literature and the increasing availability of the data on these
   systems may stimulate work in this direction. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   The end point of CTMax in F aztecus was loss of righting response (LRR).
   The acclimation response ratio (ARR) for the juveniles of the brown
   shrimp ranged between 0.20 and 0.80, which agreed with others obtained
   for crustaceans from tropical and subtropical climates.
   The brown shrimp should not be exposed to conditions that cause total
   disorientation; if this is avoided, it will permit an increase in growth
   and reduce mortalities in culture populations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease characterized
   by fibroblast expansion, and tissue remodeling. It is considered a
   multifactorial disease but the possible involved genes are largely
   unknown. Interestingly, studies regarding the possible role of major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) are scanty and show contradictory
   results. In this study, we evaluated the polymorphisms of the MHC, locus
   HLA-B, -DRB1, and -DQB1 in a cohort of 75 IPF patients and 95 controls
   by using PCR and hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotide
   probes. In addition, we examined the effect of bronchoalveolar lavage
   (BAL) from IPF patients with different MHC haplotypes on alveolar
   epithelial growth rate by WST-1 cell viability assay and on epithelial
   apoptosis by flow cytometry and by cleaved caspase-3 in cell
   homogenates. Three haplotypes were significantly increased in IPF: (1)
   HLA-B{*}15-DRB1{*}0101-DQB1{*}0501 (OR=10.72, CI=1.43-459.6; pC=0.011);
   (2) HLA-B{*}52-DRB1{*}1402-DQB1{*}0301 (OR=4.42, CI=1.21-24.1;
   pC=0.024); and (3) HLA-B{*}35-DRB1{*}0407-DQB1{*}0302 (OR=4.73,
   CI=1.53-19.5; pC=0.005). BAL from patients with the later haplotype
   significantly reduced epithelial growth rate (similar to 30\%) and
   caused epithelial cell apoptosis assayed by cleaved caspase-3 (351.7 +/-
   16.5 pg/10(6) cells versus 264 +/- 24 from controls, and 274 +/- 36.8
   and 256.5 +/- 10.7 from the other haplotypes; P < 0.05), and DNA breaks
   labeling by flow cytometry (23.7 +/- 6.9\% versus 3.1 +/- 0.7\% from
   controls, and 6.5 +/- 0.6\% and 7.6 +/- 1.2\% from the other two
   haplotypes; P < 0.01). These findings suggest that some MHC
   polymorphisms confer susceptibility to IPF, which might be related with
   the induction of epithelial cell apoptosis, a critical process in the
   development of the disease.},

Abstract = {The holotype specimen of Ralfsia expansa is examined, and a description
   including the characteristics that are presently used to distinguish the
   species of the genus is provided. Considering that the type specimen is
   sterile and that different interpretations of the species exist, its
   reproductive structures are described based on specimens obtained from
   the type locality, in Veracruz, Mexico. The observations show that the
   unangia of the species are characteristically borne on a one-celled.
   This feature distinguishes the species from the very near R. hancockii
   which has multicelled stalks. Ralfsia expansa can be distinguished from
   R. fungiformis, R. verrucosa, R. hancockii, R. hesperia, R. integra, R.
   longicellularis and R. huanghaiensis by a combination of reproductive
   features, the presence of a clearly defined cortical layer, and its
   growth form. Ralfsia pacifica does not have a cortical layer and a
   unangial stalk and is not distinct from R. verrucosa. R. expansa has
   been reported from the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, the
   Mediterranean Sea, and the coasts of India.},

   in females or males despite considerable sexual dimorphism in body size
   and a strong effect of body size on the number of mites. Male and female
   E. marnockii have similar home ranges and these results support a home
   range hypothesis to explain the similarity in the number of mites found
   in males and females. The hind legs and hind feet of E. marnockii had
   about 40\% more mites than all other regions of the body combined. This
   may be because hind legs and hind feet have a greater frequency of
   contact with mites, or the mites prefer to attach in the legs and feet.},

Abstract = {An algebraic solution for the hydrogen atom analogous to the one
   recently proposed to solve the relativistic version of the system is
   presented. We add to the usual radial description of the problem an
   additional angular variable and an associated operator which can be
   considered as part of an su(1, 1) Lie algebra. The operators of the
   algebra define radial ladder operator relating the eigenfunctions of the
   system in unit steps of the principal quantum number. We conclude that
   the radial bound states of the hydrogen atom in our extended
   configuration space can be regarded as spanning the minimal M
   representation of the su(1, 1) Lie algebra. The method can also be
   extended to solve the s-wave Morse problem and the three-dimensional
   harmonic oscillator.},

Abstract = {Polyamino acids, such as polyleucine, behave as synthetic enzymes in the
   asymmetric epoxidation of chalcone and other electron-deficient alkenes
   (the Julia-Colonna reaction). The influences of reaction conditions, of
   the molecular structure of the catalysts and of the scaling-up of the
   process on the enantioselectivity of the reaction have been determined.
   The kinetics and mechanism have been investigated using a soluble
   PEG-polyleucine conjugate, which behaves in a similar way to an enzyme,
   showing saturation kinetics for both chalcone and HOO-. Enantioselective
   catalysis is achieved with peptides with as few as five residues and
   scalemic catalysts show high chiral amplification. Here, we discuss the
   relevance of these-enzyme like catalysts to prebiotic processes, such as
   the role of small peptides in the formation of optically active
   cyanohydrins.},

   Analysis of mutual inductance between coil petals was carried out to
   compute the optimal coil separation and optimum number of petal coils.
   Mutual interaction between coil arrays was not included in the model
   because this does not drastically affect coil performance. Phased arrays
   of PERES coils show a 114\% improvement in SNR over that of the simplest

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {123},
Number = {11},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The simulation results of surface tension at the liquid-vapor interface
   are presented for fluids interacting with Lennard Jones and square-well
   potentials. From the simulation of liquids we have reported {[}M.
   Gonzalez-Melchor , J. Chem. Phys. 122, 4503 (2005)] that the components
   of pressure tensor in parallelepiped boxes are not the same when
   periodic boundary conditions and small transversal areas are used. This
   fact creates an artificial oscillatory stress anisotropy in the system
   with even negative values. By doing direct simulations of interfaces we
   show in this work that surface tension has also an oscillatory decay at
   small surface areas; this behavior is opposite to the monotonic decay
   reported previously for the Lennard Jones fluid. It is shown that for
   small surface areas, the surface tension of the square-well potential
   artificially takes negative values and even increases with temperature.
   The calculated surface tension using a direct simulation of interfaces
   might have two contributions: one from finite-size effects of
   interfacial areas due to box geometry and another from the interface.
   Thus, it is difficult to evaluate the true surface tension of an
   interface when small surface areas are used. Care has to be taken to use
   the direct simulation method of interfaces to evaluate the predicted
   surface tension as a function of interfacial area from capillary-wave
   theory. The oscillations of surface tension decay faster at temperatures
   close to the critical point. It is also discussed that a surface area
   does not show any important effect on coexisting densities, making this
   method reliable to calculate bulk coexisting properties using small
   systems. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Pollen records of a 520-cm long core from Lake Zempoala (2800 m
   altitude) and a 884-cm long composite core from Lake Quila (3010 m
   altitude), both located 65 km SW of Mexico City, show changes in
   vegetation and climate. The Zempoala record covers the last c. 6320 cal
   yr BP, while the Quila record spans the last c. 11,610 cal yr BP. These
   lakes, with submerged aquatics and hydroseral shore vegetation, lie
   today in the Abies religiosa-dominated forest belt.
   From c. 6320 to 2530 cal yr BP Zempoala shows a mixed forest with
   mesophyllous taxa, indicating warmer and more humid conditions than at
   present. From c. 2530 to 160 cal yr BP Abies forest and Pinus hartwegii
   forest dominated, indicating a temperate climate. During the first part
   of this period, from c. 2530 to 1150 cal yr BP abundant Pinus forest is
   indicative of drier climate conditions. During the last c. 310 cal yr of
   this period Abies-dominated forest prevailed, with a floral composition
   resembling the modem Abies forests. This is indicative of temperate and
   humid climatic conditions. During the last c. 160 cal yr BP the presence
   of Zea mays and Plantago reflect human impact.
   From c. 11,610 to 10,650 cal yr BP Quila shows Alnus and Pinus-dominated
   forest, reflecting humid climatic conditions. From 10,650 to 5000 cal yr
   BP Pinus and Arceuthobium are indicative of a Pinus hartwegii forest,
   suggesting slightly lower temperatures than at present. A 25-cm thick
   volcanic ash horizon at 380-355 cm core depth is the well-known `yellow
   ash' marker with a known age of c. 4200-4800 C-14 yr BP. This age is
   supported by our bracketing dates of 5620 and 4650 C-14 yr BP. From 4630
   to 1000 cal yr BP mixed forest, including Pinus, Quercus, Carpinus,
   Hedyosmum, Juglans and Artemisia, is indicative of mesophytic
   conditions. From 4630 to 1010 cal yr BP Abies forest was abundant,
   reflecting colder and more humid conditions. From c. 1010 to 20 cal yr
   BP Pinus forest was very abundant suggesting, as in site Zempoala, dry
   climatic conditions.
   The pollen record from Quila documents four different types of forest:
   Pinus/Alnus forest (possibly Alnus jorullensis in zone QUI-I), Pinus
   forest (most likely Pinus hartwegii forest in zone QUI-II), mixed forest
   in zone QUI-III), and Abies forest (Abies religiosa forest in zone
   QUI-IV). The last c. 1000 years show a decline of mixed forest and
   increasing Abies forest, reflecting cooler and more humid conditions.
   Quila also shows, during the most recent past, human impact by crop
   cultivation (Zea mays) and vegetation disturbance (Plantago) leading to
   erosion. Other microfossils, among which coprophilous fungi, were
   recorded and illustrated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Larrea tridentata (Sesse and Moc. ex DC.) Coville is used for the
   treatment of gallstones in traditional Mexican medicine. The possible
   prevention or elimination of gallstones by ethanolic and aqueous
   extracts of the leaves and twigs of L. tridentata was tested in hamsters
   fed a rich carbohydrate, fat-free diet. In addition, the effects of the
   ethanolic extract and its main metabolite, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, on
   bile secretion in the perfused liver were tested. In the experiment on
   prevention of gallstones, the dry ethanolic extract at a level of 0.5\%
   of diet completely inhibited gallstone formation, lowered biliary moles
   percent cholesterol and increased the proportion of chenodeoxycholic
   acid of hepatic bile. The dry aqueous extract at a level of 1\% of diet
   did not affect gallstone frequency or biliary parameters. In the
   experiment on elimination of gallstones, the ethanolic extract
   significantly reduced gallstone frequency, gallbladder bile cholesterol
   concentration and moles percent cholesterol. Both the ethanolic extract
   and nordihydroguaiaretic acid had cholestatic effects in the perfused
   liver, with an EC50 of 34 and 28 mg dL(-1), respectively, when perfused
   for 10 min. This effect was reversible with concentrations up to 40 mg
   dL(-1). The results indicate that L. tridentata could be useful in the
   treatment of gallstone disease, however care must be taken due to its
   hepatotoxicity.},

Abstract = {Friction is, in general, a very complicated function of velocity. The

   systems with friction of the form f = -m lambda v(n) and add some

Abstract = {Anolis porcatus is a tropical lizard endemic to Cuba. Monthly samples of
   lizards were obtained from the urban area surrounding Havana, Cuba.
   Testicular size and weight in males, and oocyte diameter and the
   presence of oviductal eggs in females, varied with season. Histological
   examination of gonads indicated a seasonal pattern in mature gametes for
   both sexes. In males, the spermatogenic process began with early gonadal
   recrudescence in November and the testes attained maximal spermatogenic
   activity between March and August. Spermatogenesis diminished during
   September and ceased in October. In females, only previtellogenic
   follicles were observed in the ovaries from November through February,
   and vitellogenesis began in March, and the first oviductal eggs were
   observed during late April. Vitellogenesis and oviductal eggs were
   observed from April to October. The timing of the gametogenic events
   indicates that male and female gonadal cycles are synchronized,
   corresponding to prenuptial spermatogenesis.},

Abstract = {The osmoregulatory response and oxygen consumption rate of the strictly
   freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium tuxtlaense were measured under different
   salinity conditions. The goal of these experiments was to explore how
   the adaptive process to the freshwater environment has proceeded from a
   metabolic point of view in a hololimnetic species. Nine to 11 intermoult
   prawns were exposed to salinities of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 parts
   per thousand, respectively. Once oxygen consumption was measured,
   haemolymph osmolality was determined by sampling of 20 mu l aliquots.
   The results indicate that the oxygen consumption rate decreased
   significantly with increasing salinity. The respiration of prawns
   exposed to 5 parts per thousand salinity was 56\% higher than the rate
   of those exposed to 20 and 25 parts per thousand. The prawns behaved as
   strong hyperregulators in low salinity; at higher salinities, the
   haemolymph osmolality showed a sharp increase, although it remained
   hyperosmotic to the medium; the isosmotic point was reached at 700 mOsm.
   Based on our results, M. tuxilaense in general shows a pattern similar
   to that of other hololimnetic species, but with some unique aspects,
   such as a high isosmotic point and an inability to survive at salinities
   above 28 parts per thousand. This suggests an advanced degree of
   adaptation to the freshwater environment.},

Title = {Up-regulation and profibrotic role of osteopontin in human idiopathic

Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {2},

Pages = {891-903},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and
   lethal disorder characterized by fibroproliferation and excessive
   accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung.
   Methods and Findings Using oligonucleotide arrays, we identified
   osteopontin as one of the genes that significantly distinguishes IPF
   from normal lungs. Osteopontin was localized to alveolar epithelial
   cells in IPF lungs and was also significantly elevated in
   bronchoalveolar lavage from IPF patients. To study the fibrosis-relevant
   effects of osteopontin we stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts and
   alveolar epithelia] cells (A549) with recombinant osteopontin.
   Osteopontin induced a significant increase of migration and
   proliferation in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Epithelial
   growth was inhibited by the pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) and
   antibody to CD44, while fibroproliferation was inhibited by GRGDS and
   antibody to OCA integrin. Fibroblast and epithelial cell migration were
   inhibited by GRGDS, anti-CD44, and anti-alpha(v)beta(3). In fibroblasts,
   osteopontin up-regulated tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 and type
   I Collagen, and down-regulated matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1)
   expression, while in A549 cells it caused up-regulation of MMP-7. In
   human IPF lungs, osteopontin colocalized with MMP-7 in alveolar
   epithelial cells, and application of weakest link statistical models to
   microarray data suggested a significant interaction between osteopontin
   and MMP-7.
   Conclusions Our results provide a potential mechanism by which
   osteopontin secreted from the alveolar epithelium may exert a
   profibrotic effect in IPF lungs and highlight osteopontin as a potential
   target for therapeutic intervention in this incurable disease.},

Abstract = {Numerous human diseases- malaria, dengue, yellow fever and
   leishmaniasis, to name a few-are transmitted by insect vectors with
   brief life cycles and biting activity that varies in both space and
   time. Although the general geographic distributions of these
   epidemiologically important species are known, the spatiotemporal
   variation in their emergence and activity remains poorly understood. We
   used ecological niche modeling via a genetic algorithm to produce
   time-specific predictive models of monthly distributions of. Aedes
   aegypti in Mexico in 1995. Significant predictions of monthly mosquito
   activity and distributions indicate that predicting spatiotemporal
   dynamics of disease vector species is feasible; significant coincidence
   with human cases of dengue indicate that these dynamics probably
   translate directly into transmission of dengue virus to humans. This
   approach provides new potential for optimizing use of resources for
   disease prevention and remediation via automated forecasting of disease
   transmission risk. (c) 2005 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and

Abstract = {Paleozoic rocks exposed in northeast Hidalgo State, Mexico, have
   traditionally been assigned to the Guacamaya Formation, a orogenic
   flysch assemblage associated with the collision of South and North
   America during the formation of Pangea. However, major differences exist
   in the stratigraphy of these rocks and those of the Guacamaya Formation
   at its type section. The rocks of Hidalgo are here redefined as the
   Tuzancoa Formation, and comprise interbedded submarine
   andesitic-basaltic lava flows, siliciclastic turbidites, volcaniclastic
   turbidites, calcareous debris-flows, and lenses of conglomerate. The
   Tuzancoa Formation contains abundant Permian (Wolfcampian-Leonardian)
   fossils. The lavas and volcaniclastics are andesitic to basaltic in
   composition, and are related to subduction. Their BEE patterns are
   similar to those of recent island are magmas, with slight enrichment in
   LREE, flat HREE, and no Eu anomaly. The epsilon(Nd(280)) of +4.38 in a
   representative sample is also similar to island arcs and Suggests little
   crustal contamination. However, field evidence indicates that the arc
   was built upon Precambrian continental crust. Thus, we infer that the
   ``primitive{''} arc geochemical signatures reflect emplacement on thin
   crust or under extensional conditions. The Tuzancoa Formation is
   interpreted to have been deposited in in intra-arc basin, and is
   probably related to rocks of the Las Delicias Formation in Coahuila and
   to the Guacamaya Formation in Tamaulipas. All are thought to have formed
   within a continental are that extended throughout east-central Mexico in
   the Early Permian.},

   most frequently isolated. A series of sesquiterpenes and long-chain
   hydrocarbons were isolated and identified from the barks of some of the
   studied species. Some volatiles were assayed for anti -inflammatory
   activity using the TPA-induced ear edema bioassay in mice. The volatile
   fraction from Bursera lancifolia was about half as active as

Abstract = {Fibroblasts consist of heterogeneous subpopulations that have distinct
   roles in fibrotic responses. Previously we reported enhanced
   proliferation in response to fibrogenic growth factors and selective
   activation of latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in
   fibroblasts lacking cell surface expression of Thy-1 glycoprotein,
   suggesting that Thy-1 modulates the fibrogenic potential of fibroblasts.
   Here we report that compared to controls Thy-1-/- C57BL/6 mice displayed
   more severe histopathological lung fibrosis, greater accumulation of
   lung collagen, and increased TGF-beta activation in the lungs 14 days
   after intratracheal bleomycin. The majority of cells demonstrating
   TGF-beta activation and myofibroblast differentiation in
   bleomycin-induced lesions were Thy-l-negative. Histological sections
   from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis demonstrated absent
   Thy-1 staining within fibroblastic foci. Normal lung fibroblasts, in
   both mice and humans, were predominantly Thy-1-positive. The fibrogenic
   cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced loss of
   fibroblast Thy-1 surface expression in vitro, which was associated with
   Thy-1 shedding, Smad phosphorylation, and myofibroblast differentiation.
   These results suggest that fibrogenic injury promotes loss of lung
   fibroblast Thy-1 expression, resulting in enhanced fibrogenesis.},

Abstract = {Oogenesis in the lizard Mabuya brachypoda is seasonal, with oogenesis
   initiated during May-June and ovulation occurring during July-August.
   This species ovulates an egg that is microlecithal, having very small
   yolk stores. The preovulatory oocyte attains a maximum diameter of
   0.9-1.3 mm. Two elongated germinal beds, formed by germinal epithelia
   containing oogonia, early oocytes, and somatic cells, are found on the
   dorsal surface of each ovary. Although microlecithal eggs are ovulated
   in this species, oogenesis is characterized by both previtellogenic and
   vitellogenic stages. During early previtellogenesis, the nucleus of the
   oocyte contains lampbrush chromosomes, whereas the ooplasm stains
   lightly with a perinuclear yolk nucleus. During late previtellogenesis
   the ooplasm displays basophilic staining with fine granular material
   composed of irregularly distributed bundles of thin fibers. A
   well-defined zona pellucida is also observed. The granulosa, initially
   composed of a single layer of squamous cells during early
   previtellogenesis, becomes multilayered and polymorphic. As with other
   squamate reptiles, the granulosa at this stage is formed by three cell
   types: small, intermediate, and large or pyriform cells. As
   vitellogenesis progresses the oocyte displays abundant vacuoles and
   small, but scarce, yolk platelets at the periphery of the oocyte. The
   zona pellucida attains its maximum thickness during late oogenesis, a
   period when the granulosa is again reduced to a single layer of squamous
   cells. The vitellogenic process observed in M. brachypoda corresponds
   with the earliest vitellogenic stages seen in other viviparous lizard
   species with larger oocytes. The various species of the genus Mabuya
   provided us with important models to understand a major transition in
   the evolution of viviparity, the development of a microlecithal egg.},

Abstract = {Aim The Mexican transition zone is a complex area where Neotropical and
   Nearctic biotic elements overlap. A previous study on mammal species has
   shown a great diversification in the area. We analyse the
   diversification of their flea species (Insecta: Siphonaptera), in order
   to determine if a diversification similar to their mammal host species
   has occurred.
   Location The area analysed corresponds to Mexico.
   Methods The panbiogeographical or track analysis was based on the
   comparison of the individual tracks of 112 species belonging to 48
   genera and eight families of the order Siphonaptera. Generalized tracks
   were obtained based on the comparison of the individual tracks. Nodes
   were found in the areas where generalized tracks overlapped.
   Results Thirty-four generalized tracks were obtained, distributed within
   the Mexican transition zone (20), the Nearctic region plus the Mexican
   transition zone (8), the Nearctic region (4) and the Neotropical region
   plus the Mexican transition zone (2). In the areas where they
   intersected, 26 nodes were identified: 23 in the Mexican transition zone
   and 3 in the Nearctic region.
   Main conclusions The nodes are concentrated in the Transmexican Volcanic
   Belt (14), Sierra Madre Oriental (5) and Sierra Madre del Sur (4)
   provinces of the Mexican transition zone. These results show a
   significant diversification of the flea taxa, in parallel with the
   diversification of their mammal hosts.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study prime preradicals, irreducible preradicals,
   Lambda-prime preradicals, prime submodules and diuniform modules. We
   study some relations between these concepts, using the lattice structure
   of preradicals developed in previous papers. In particular, we give a
   characterization of prime preradicals using an operator named the
   relative annihilator. We also characterize prime submodules by means of
   prime preradicals. We give some characterizations of rings that have
   certain conditions on prime radicals and on irreducible preradicals,
   such as left local left V-rings, as well as 1-spr rings, which we
   introduce.},

Title = {On the presence of Stephanodiscus niagarae Ehrenberg in central

Abstract = {Stephanodiscus niagarae is frequently reported from late Pleistocene (>
   10,000 yr BP) sediments in central Mexico, with lower abundances through
   the Holocene. Its presence in Holocene and modern environments in
   central Mexico was not well documented until our study, where we report
   on three populations of S. niagarae, one middle Holocene population with
   particularly high abundance from the Upper Lerma Basin, and two modern
   sites, Valle de Bravo and Santa Elena. The three sites are located in
   the same geographical area, in the State of Mexico. The fossil material
   dates to ca. 6600-4900 yr BP, with S. niagarae reaching up to 90\% of
   the diatom counts. Stephanodiscus niagarae is present in association
   with Fragilaria pinnata, F. brevistriata, and Aulacoseira granulata. In
   Valle de Bravo (ca. 30 m deep) S. niagarae is present in very low
   numbers in water column and surface sediments samples (< 1\%); the
   diatom assemblage is dominated by Fragilaria crotonensis in association
   with A. granulata, A. granulata var. curvata and Cyclotella ocellata. In
   Santa Elena, a shallow, intermittent irrigation channel, S. niagarae is
   the second most abundant alga; the diatom assemblage is dominated by S.
   niagarae in association with A. granulata, A. granulata var. curvata and
   F. crotonensis. Both modern sites show a trend to eutrophy and these
   diatom assemblages are taken as indicative of this trend. It is
   suggested researchers should be cautions when the presence of S.
   niagarae in sedimentary records is taken as indicative of deep waters
   conditions, as the present data show that this species can thrive in
   rather shallow environments in Mexico.},

Title = {Phylogeny and evolution of dorsal pattern in the Mexican endemic lizard
   genus Barisia (Anguidae: Gerrhonotinae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-257},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The phylogeny of the Mexican lizard genus Barisia was assessed using an
   878 bp fragment of the mtDNA ND4 gene and a section of associated tRNA
   genes, as well as 16 external morphological characters. The terminal
   taxa comprised the currently recognized members of Barisia, including
   the four subspecies of the polytypic Barisia imbricata and individuals
   from different populations of the widespread B. i. imbricata and Barisia
   i. ciliaris, although for Barisia levicollis only morphology could be
   examined. The `step-matrix frequency' and the `step-matrix
   gap-weighting' coding approaches were employed simultaneously for the
   morphological data set, and three different scaling methods were
   evaluated for the last approach. Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were
   performed for the separate and combined data sets and Bayesian analysis
   was also performed for the mtDNA sequence data. The hypothesis obtained
   from the simultaneous MP analysis strongly supports the monophyly of
   Barisia, but the `exclusivity' of B. imbricata as well as of B. i.
   imbricata and B. i. ciliaris were not recovered. Moreover, inclusion of
   the morphological data showed B. levicollis nested within a clade
   together with the taxa assigned to B. i. ciliaris. This, together with
   the genetic distances and geographic concordance among the haplotypes
   examined, confirms that B. imbricata represents several species,
   although the actual species limits in this composite taxon are still
   unclear. Applying previously published rates of molecular evolution to
   the mtDNA data gives ages of divergence similar to the times proposed
   for some Pleistocene-Miocene geological and climatic phenomena that
   occurred in the Mexican territory. Variation of the dorsal pattern
   within Barisia was mapped onto the simultaneous morphological and
   molecular phylogeny, indicating that the two main states present in the
   taxa assigned to B. imbricata, an adult dorsal pattern present in
   females and absent in males and the absence of any pattern in both
   sexes, occur each in separate lineages. This suggests a possible
   scenario, where sexual dichromatism within Barisia has been repeatedly
   lost in different lineages.},

Abstract = {Both mature and underdeveloped soils are present in tropical mountainous
   landscapes. The spatial arrangement of mountainous soils is ascribed
   mainly to geomorphologic processes. We studied two soil toposequences
   (one on a convex, and the other on a concave slope with a gradient
   40-60\%) at the coffee-growing farm La Cabana, situated in the mountains
   of the Sierra Madre del Sur, southern Mexico. Mature (Alisols) as well
   as moderately developed (Luvic Phaeozems) and underdeveloped soils
   (Fluvic and Skeletic Phaeozems) were detected in the study area. The
   sequence of sediments and soils is unusual for a classical soil catena.
   Buried clayey reddish soils are present on the shoulder of a slope;
   colluvial sediments with weakly developed soils form convex and concave
   footslopes. The peculiarity of the slopes and spatial distribution of
   soils in the studied toposequences were ascribed to intensive linear
   erosion (due to tectonic uplift), seismically induced landslides, and
   K-cycles of laminar erosion. The diversity of sediments leads to
   considerable variation in soil texture and mineralogical composition,
   and, thus, to the diversity of soil properties, which is considered to
   be a positive feature of a landscape. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A new flea species, Hystrichopsylla cryptotis, is described from the
   Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre del Sur, Mexico. The host of this
   new species is the shrew Cryptotis mexicana ( Coues, 1877) ( Mammalia:
   Soricidae). This flea species is easily recognized by its large size,
   seven genal combs, and the slender sternum IX, with 13 pairs of thick
   spiniform setae of different sizes. A key to the Mexican and Guatemalan
   species of Hystrichopsylla is given. The cladistic analysis indicates
   that Mexican species of Hystrichopsylla may be arranged in two different
   species groups: the H. orophila species group (H. orophila Barrera 1952
   and H. cryptotis) and the H. dippiei species group (H. dippiei
   Rotshchild 1902, H. llorentei Ayala and Morales 1990, and H. kris Traub

Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome which affects more and more people in
   all countries over the world. In Mexico, it is commonly treated with
   herbal extracts. Such treatment may be of considerable benefit
   especially during the early stages of the illness. In this review, we
   discuss species commonly used in Mexico in the treatment of diabetes. A
   total of 306 species have records of a popular use in the treatment of
   this syndrome in Mexico. Seven of these species - Cecropia obtusifolia
   Bertol. (Cecropiaceae), Equisetum myriochaetum Schlecht \& Cham
   (Equisetaceae), Acosmium panamense (Benth.) Yacolev (Fabaceae),
   Cucurbita ficifolia Bouche (Cucurbitaceae), Agarista mexicana (Hemsl.)
   Judd. (Ericaeae), Brickellia veronicaefolia (Kunth) A. Gray
   (Asteraceae), Parmentiera aculeata (Kunth) Seem. (Bignoniaceae) - are
   discussed in greater detail, highlighting our current knowledge about
   these botanicals, but also the enormous gaps in our knowledge, most
   notably as it relates to the species' toxicology, the pharmacokinetics
   of its active constituents and their metabolism. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Title = {How important is clonal recruitment for population maintenance in rare

Abstract = {Stenocereus eruca is a postrate columnar cactus whose regeneration seems
   to occur mainly through clonal propagation. It is a narrow endemic
   species of the Sonoran desert in Baja California Sur and currently
   considered as threatened under Mexican legislation. In this paper we
   describe the demography of ramets in four populations along its
   distribution range and the demography of genets in one population during
   a 3-year-study period in order to evaluate its conservation status. We
   also analyze the relative contribution of sexual reproduction and clonal
   propagation to population maintenance and provide guidelines for the
   formulation of conservation programs. Elasticity analyses were used to
   explore the relative contribution of sexual and clonal recruitment to
   projected population growth rate (lambda). During the three years of
   study, regeneration occurred only through clonal propagation while
   sexually derived seedlings were not detected within or outside the
   permanent plots. Our demographic data showed that the four population of
   S. eruca are in equilibrium (lambda approximate to 1), and elasticity
   analyses showed that the relative contribution to of clonal recruitment
   was larger than sexual recruitment, at least during the analyzed
   ecological time scale. Simulations showed that removing sexual
   recruitment had a minor impact on lambda, but the absence of clonal
   propagation alone was sufficient to keep below unity. We propose the
   establishment of at least one reserve with adequate protection from
   human disturbance to conserve S. eruca. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The spatial distribution of europium-dihalide-type precipitates in KCl :
   KBr : Eu2+ single crystals annealed at 200 degrees C for long periods of
   time was determined by epifluorescence optical microscopy. Laue-type
   patterns and optical spectroscopy were used to test the degree of
   long-range ordering of the specimens and to monitor the precipitation
   during annealing, respectively. Precipitates smaller than about 0.08 mu
   m were found (2.84 x 10(12) precipitates cm(-3)) all across the host,
   whereas larger precipitates of about 0.17 mu m were found (2.9 x 10(4)
   precipitates cm(-1)) along certain linear structural singularities of
   the matrix. These singularities, identified as crystal dislocations,
   were observed to terminate always either at a triple node of
   singularities or at the crystal surface, forming a three-dimensional
   network of crystal singularities (2.0 x 10(6) singularities cm(-2)),
   identified as the Frank network. The presence of europium exhaustive
   matrix zones accompanying the observed europium-decorated paths
   indicates that impurity segregation processes, occurring during
   annealing, favour the precipitation phenomena.},

Volume = {122},

Abstract = {Latitudinal sexual segregation during the nonbreeding season, in which
   males tend to winter farther north than females, is known to occur in
   many temperate-zone bird species. This pattern, however, has rarely been
   reported in species wintering in tropical regions. We investigated
   latitudinal sexual segregation in 45 Nearctic-Neotropical migratory bird
   species that winter in Mexico, using specimen records from 35
   natural-history museums. We found significant latitudinal segregation in
   nine species: Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), Swainson's
   Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Orange-crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata),
   Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia; aestiva group), Yellow-rumped
   Warbler (Dendroica coronata; coronata group), Black-and-white Warbler
   (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Wilson's Warbler
   (Wilsonia pusilla), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea). In most
   cases, males predominated in the northern part of species' winter ranges
   and females in the south, but the trend was reversed in Indigo Buntings.
   Discovering the frequency of latitudinal sexual segregation in
   Neotropical migratory birds will influence understanding of avian
   ecology and migration systems.},

Abstract = {If a cold catalyst is exposed to a mixture of fuel + oxygen, the surface
   coverage of the catalyst can be dominated by either the fuel or the
   oxygen, depending on the actual catalyst and the composition of the
   gaseous mixture. If the temperature is increased, heterogeneous ignition
   occurs; the ignition temperature is influenced by the adsorption and
   desorption properties of both the fuel and the oxygen. Based on the
   equations for the heat balance, expressions have been derived for
   calculating the ignition temperature from the parameters of the
   experimental setup and the adsorption and desorption parameters of the
   fuel and the oxygen. These expressions can also be used to evaluate
   measured ignition temperatures to determine unknown adsorption and
   desorption parameters, such as the preexponential factor AD and
   activation energy E(D) for the desorption of the dominant surface
   species, the ratio of the sticking coefficients, and the ratio of the
   adsorption orders of the fuel and oxygen. This latter approach was used
   to evaluate measurements made by Cho and Law for the catalytic ignition
   of ethene and propene on polycrystalline platinum. The following
   parameters were determined by means of nonlinear least-squares fitting:
   E(D)(C(2)H(4)/Pt) = 136 +/- 21 kJ/mol, ED(C(3)H(6)/Pt) = 161 +/- 53
   kJ/mol, S(CH4),(0)/S(O2),0 = 15.6 +/- 1.9, S(C3H6),(0)/S(O2),(0) = 11.9
   +/- 1.7. Using a previously determined value for the sticking
   coefficient of O(2), the values S(C2H4),(0) = 0.38 +/- 0.08 and
   S(C3H6),(0) = 0.29 +/- 0.06 were obtained. These error limits refer to a
   confidence level of 0.95. Experimental ignition temperatures could be
   reproduced assuming second order adsorption of ethene and propene on a
   surface of Pt. (c) 2005 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {A 291-kDa lectin (LsL) was purified from the hemolymph of the white
   shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus by affinity chromatography on
   glutaraldehyde-fixed stroma from rabbit erythrocytes. LsL is a
   heterotetramer of two 80-kDa and two 52-kDa subunits, with no
   covalently-liked carbohydrate, and mainly composed by aspartic and
   glutamic acids, glycine and alanine, with relatively lower methionine
   and cysteine contents. Edman degradation indicated that the NH2-terminal
   of the 80-kDa subunit is composed DASNAQKQHDVNFLL, whereas the
   NH2-terminal of the 52-kDa subunit is blocked. The peptide mass
   fingerprint of LsL was predicted from tryptic peptides from each subunit
   by MALDI-TOF, and revealed that each subunit showed 23 and 22\%,
   respectively, homology with the hemocyanin precursor from Litopenaeus
   vannamei. Circular dichroism analysis revealed beta sheet and alpha
   helix contents of 52.7 and 6.1\%, respectively. LsL agglutinate at
   higher titers guinea pig, murine, and rabbit erythrocytes its activity
   is divalent cation-dependent. N-acetylated sugars, such as GlcNAc,
   GaINAc, and NeuAc, were the most effective inhibitors of the LsL
   hemagglutinating activity. Sialylated O-glycosylated proteins, such as
   bovine submaxillary gland mucin, human IgA, and fetuin, showed stronger
   inhibitory activity than sialylated N-glycosylated proteins, such as
   human orosomucoid, IgG, transferrin, and lactoferrin. Desialylation of
   erythrocytes or inhibitory glycoproteins abolished their capacity to
   bind LsL, confirming the relevance of sialic acid in LsL-ligand
   interactions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Introduction and institutionalization of genetics in Mexico},

Abstract = {We explore the distinctive characteristics of Mexico's society, politics
   and history that impacted the establishment of genetics in Mexico, as a
   new disciplinary field that began in the early 20th century and was
   consolidated and institutionalized in the second half. We identify about
   three stages in the institutionalization of genetics in Mexico. The
   first stage can be characterized by Edmundo Taboada, who was the leader
   of a research program initiated during the Cardenas government
   (1934-1940), which was primarily directed towards improving the
   condition of small Mexican farmers. Taboada is the first Mexican
   post-graduate investigator in phytotechnology and phytopathology,
   trained at Cornell University and the University of Minnesota, in 1932
   and 1933, respectively. He was the first investigator to teach plant
   genetics at the National School of Agriculture and wrote the first
   textbook of general genetics, Genetics Notes, in 1938. Taboada's most
   important single genetics contribution was the production of
   ``stabilized{''} corn varieties. The extensive exile of Spanish
   intellectuals to Mexico, after the end of Spain's Civil War (1936-1939),
   had a major influence in Mexican science and characterizes the second
   stage. The three main personalities contributing to Mexican genetics are
   Federico Bonet de Marco and Bibiano Fernandez Osorio Tafall, at the
   National School of Biological Sciences, and Jose Luis de la Loma y
   Oteyza, at the Chapingo Agriculture School. The main contribution of the
   Spanish exiles to the introduction of genetics in Mexico concerned
   teaching. They introduced in several universities genetics as a
   distinctive discipline within the biology curriculum and wrote genetics
   text books and manuals. The third stage is identified with Alfonso Leon
   de Garay, who founded the Genetics and Radiobiology Program in 1960
   within the National Commission of Nuclear Energy, which had been founded
   in 1956. The Genetics and Radiobiology Program rapidly became a
   disciplinary program, for it embraced research, teaching, and training
   of academics and technicians. The Mexican Genetics Society, created by
   de Garay in 1966, and the development of strains and cultures for
   genetics research were important activities. One of de Garay's key
   requirements was the compulsory training of the Program's scientists for
   at least one or two years in the best universities of the United States
   and Europe. De Garay's role in the development of Mexican genetics was
   fundamental. His broad vision encompassed the practice of genetics in
   all its manifestations.},

   changes in the Ru-O(3)-Ru bond angle, which is a measure of the rotation
   of the RuO6 octahedra around the c-axis, or in the Cu-O(1)-Ru bond angle
   phi, which is a measure of the canting of the RuO6 octahedra. On the
   other hand, the Cu-O(2)-Cu bond angle, which is a measure of the
   buckling of the CuO2 layer, has a slight tendency to decrease with
   increase of the Fe content. We found that both ferromagnetic and
   superconducting transition temperatures are reduced with increase of the
   Fe concentration. Analysis related to the decay of the superconducting
   and ferromagnetic states is presented.},

Abstract = {Reproductive and fat body cycles were studied in a population of
   viviparous lizards (Sceloporus grammicus) from the Teotihuacan area,
   state of Mexico between October 1984 and September 1985. Males reached
   sexual maturity at a snout-vent length (SVL) of 44.5 mm and at an age of
   6 to 7 mo; females reached sexual maturity at 44.1 mm SVL and at an age
   of 8 to 9 mo. Testicular mass of adult males began to increase in size
   in May and peaked during July, August, and September. Maximum testicular
   growth was associated with precipitation, but not with temperature and
   photoperiod. Enlarged vitellogenic follicles appeared during October,
   and females contained embryos in stages I through 8 during November.
   Females had embryos in later embryonic stages 29 through 40 from January
   to April. Vitellogenesis and embryonic development were associated with
   increasing photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation. Mean litter size
   was 5.09 +/- 0.24 (2 to 9). Mean RCM was 0.338 +/- 0.024 (0.015 to
   0.80). Litter size and RCM were positively correlated with female SVL.},

Abstract = {We used light microscopy to study placental structure of the lizard
   Sceloporus mucronatus throughout 6 months of embryonic development.
   Three stages of placental development could be assigned to embryos based
   on the arrangement of the extraembryonic membranes. A highly vascular
   choriovitelline placenta was present in the embryonic hemisphere and a
   nonvascular bilaminar omphalopleure covered most of the abembryonic
   hemisphere of the egg during embryonic Stages 10-28. A chorioallantoic
   placenta replaced the choriovitelline placenta by embryonic Stage 29 and
   an omphaloplacenta covered the abembryonic hemisphere at this stage. The
   combination of these two placental types occurred in Stage 29-36
   embryos. The final stage of placentation, embryonic Stages 37-40, was
   characterized by an omphalallantoic placenta in the abembryonic
   hemisphere and a chorioallantoic placenta in the embryonic hemisphere of
   the egg. The choriovitelline and chorioallantoic placentae are well
   vascularized, with closely apposed maternal and embryonic blood vessels.
   These structures are the most likely sites of respiratory exchange. In
   contrast, the omphaloplacenta and omphalallantoic placentae contain
   cuboidal or columnar epithelia and these structures may function in
   histotrophic exchange. Placentation of S. mucronatus is similar to that
   of predominantly lecithotrophic species in other squamate lineages
   suggesting that the evolution of this placental morphology is a response
   to similar factors and is independent of phylogeny. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {This paper presents an extension of an algorithm recently published
   {[}Appl. Math. Comput. 133 (2002) 119] for the group theoretical
   classification of quantum states for molecular systems. In the original
   paper it was shown how this algorithm Could be used to classify
   vibrational states. Here we show how to perforin the classification of
   electronic states and discussed the advantage of using this technique
   over the traditional methods. It consists in finding the minimal set of
   symmetry operations needed to identify unequivocally the symmetry for
   each state and a direct calculation of the character of the
   representation expanded by the vector state. In order to illustrate the
   application of our method we show the classification of the electronic
   states for two different cluster systems of symmetries D-4h and I-h. (c)

Title = {The role of rustic coffee plantations in the conservation of wild tree

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rustic coffee plantations are characterised by the use of numerous wild
   and cultivated tree species for providing shade to the coffee shrubs.
   This paper analyses the role of these plantations in wild tree
   conservation through the examination of their patterns of floristic
   variation in southern Mexico. The studied plantations included a total
   of 45 plant species, most of which were wild tree species, including
   both mature forest and pioneer taxa. An extrapolation of the species
   accumulation curve among stands indicated that the whole system,
   composed of more than 100 coffee plantations, may harbour as many as 34
   species of wild trees. The floristic structure of rustic coffee
   plantations was highly variable. This variation is a result of a
   combination of factors such as human management, original stand cover
   and the asynchrony in development stage of different plantations. This
   promotes a large beta-diversity in the system. Thus, although a single
   plantation may have a limited potential to preserve wild tree species,
   it is the whole ensemble of floristically heterogeneous plantations
   which renders this agroforestry system valuable for plant diversity
   conservation, particularly in a region where native forest vegetation
   has almost disappeared.},

Journal = {AGROCIENCIA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {303-310},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Phosphorus is one of the principal mineral nutrients required by plants,
   but it is also one of the least available nutrients in soils. The form
   of P readily accessed by plants is as orthophosphate ions H2PO4-, HPO42-
   (Pi), but its concentration rarely exceeds 10 mu M; therefore, the
   plants are continually exposed to phosphate deficiency. Reports
   describing the changes induced during phosphate deficiency in soybean
   (Glycine max) plants were not found. Therefore, the objective of this
   study was to evaluate the response of soybean to Pi defficiency. Root
   growth was not modified in soybean, var. Tapachula 86, grown under
   phosphate sufficiency or under different phosphate deficiencies, whereas
   shoot growth was stopped. Secreted acid phosphatase activity increased
   almost ten fold in plants grown under Pi absence, whereas the activity
   of these enzymes only increased between four and five times in the other
   Pi deficiency treatments. Amount of Pi was higher in phytic acid and in
   aluminum phosphate treatments, indicating that soybean plants also
   produce phytases and organic acids which help Pi mobilization. However,
   these adaptations were insufficient to promote normal plant growth.},

Abstract = {In this study, a comprehensive view of a model crystal formation in a
   complex fluctuating medium is presented. The model incorporates Gaussian
   curvature effects at the crystal boundary as well as the possibility for
   super-diffusive motion near the crystal surface. A special emphasis is
   put on the finite-size effect of the building blocks (macroions, or the
   aggregates of macroions) constituting the crystal. From it an integrated
   static-dynamic picture of the crystal formation in terms of mesoscopic
   nonequilibrium thermodynamics (MNET), and with inclusion of the
   physically sound effects mentioned, emerges. Its quantitative measure
   appears to be the overall diffusion function of the formation which
   contains both finite-size curvature-inducing effects as well as a
   time-dependent super-diffusive part. A quite qualitative agreement with
   experiments, mostly those concerning investigations of dynamic growth
   layer of (poly) crystalline aggregation, exemplified by non-Kossel
   crystals and biomolecular spherulites, has been achieved.},

Abstract = {Understanding mechanisms involved in the maintenance of gynodioecy in
   natural populations requires evidence concerning the phenotypic
   expression and reproductive consequences of male sterility. We have
   recently discovered male sterility in populations of Kallstroemia
   grandiflora from northwestern Mexico. Here we describe the development
   of anther and pollen grains in hermaphrodite and female plants and
   explore whether females experience any compensatory advantage over
   hermaphrodites. The major difference in anther development between
   morphs was the early disintegration of tapetal cells in anthers of
   pistillate flowers. Abnormalities in developing pollen grains in
   pistillate flowers were seen in the microspore mother cells, microspore
   tetrads, and young and mature pollen grains. Biomass allocation to
   flowers, petals, and stamens were larger in hermaphrodites, while both
   sexes had the same number of ovules per flower. Hermaphrodite flowers
   were self-compatible. Pollination experiments revealed evidence of
   pollinator limitation for female plants but not for hermaphrodites. No
   evidence of reproductive compensation was detected, as flower and fruit
   production were similar for both sexes in two populations of K.
   grandiflora. We suggest alternative mechanisms that could maintain male
   sterility in natural populations of K. grandiflora.},

Abstract = {The genus Blennothrix belongs to the family Oscillatoriaceae (subfamily
   Oscillatorioideae), differing from others in the subfamily by the
   presence of several trichomes in a sheath. Freshwater members of
   Blennothrix have been recently divided into eight species (Komarek
   1998), with the taxon B. ganeshii Watanabe et Komarek reported from
   three sites in two tropical basins of the central region of Mexico.
   However, information on anatomical (vegetative and reproductive)
   characters and environmental distribution is scarce and species
   determination is uncertain. This study analyses the anatomical structure
   of Blennothrix populations distributed in different sites along the
   central tropical region of Mexico in order to determine the taxonomic
   status of the studied populations. Eight populations were sampled, with
   concurrent environmental data recorded. Morphological characters
   previously considered to be of taxonomic importance, as well as
   complementary features such as algal mat length, filament diameter,
   trichome width, length of cells, and thickness and shape of the sheath
   were measured in several filaments of each sample. Our results showed
   that all the observed populations in the central region of Mexico fit
   within the circumscription of B. ganeshii (Watanabe \& Komarek 1989,
   Komarek 1998). However, two important morphological features were
   observed in all populations. First, branches were rarely present and
   varying in frequency from 1 to 3 trichomes per filament. Second, the
   presence of a transverse lamellation due to constriction in the
   longitudinal axis of the sheath was observed. Some morphological
   characters described for this species were extended.},

Abstract = {Bismuth oxide films deposited by spray pyrolysis, using bismuth acetate
   or bismuth chloride, onto clear fused quartz and single crystalline
   silicon substrates were thermally converted into bismuth silicate
   compounds. Bismuth silicate compounds' chemical compositions depend on
   the annealing temperature; Bi2SiO5 is obtained at 600 degrees C and
   Bi4Si3O12 is produced at 750 degrees C. Forbidden energy optical band
   gap increases from 3.78 eV for as-deposited films up to 4.89 eV for
   annealed films. Current densities of 10(-6) A/cm(2), in
   metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures, are observed for Bi2SiO5
   films at applied electric fields 300 kV/cm and for Bi4Si3O12, films for
   2.5 MV/cm. A value of the order of 10.6 was calculated for the apparent
   dielectric constant of the specimen obtained by annealing at 800 degrees

Abstract = {Brachiopods are common in the lower and middle parts of the early
   Mississippian (Osagean) Vicente Guerrero Formation that is mainly a
   fine-grained quartz arenite found in the Ciudad Victoria area,
   Tamaulipas, northeastern Mexico. This shallow marine brachiopod fauna
   includes several spire-bearers: Lamellosathyris lamellosa,
   Cleiothyridina cf. tenuilineata, Camarophorella sp., Alispirifer
   tamaulipensis n. sp., Tylothyris? sp., Torynifer pseudolineatus,
   Syringothyris cf. typa, Syringothyris? sp., and Punctospirifer sp.
   Similar assemblages have been found in Osagean rocks of the Santiago
   Formation, Oaxaca, southeastern Mexico, and in several coeval formations
   in the USA: Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Ohio, and Texas. North American
   biogeographic affinities are suggested for these Mississippian faunas of
   northeastern Mexico. These contrast markedly with the Late Silurian
   situation, where the Tamaulipas material has Old World Realm, rather
   than North American, biogeographic affinities. This supports the
   interpretation that northeastern Mexico was an integral part of North
   America by the Mississippian, but not in the Late Silurian.},

Abstract = {Although controversial. Creosote bush, Larrea tridentata (Sesse and Moc.
   ex DC) Coville, is used to treat a variety of illnesses including
   infertility. rheumatism. arthritis, diabetes, gallbladder and kidney
   stones, pain and inflammation. Recently, it has been used as a
   nutritional supplement. The primary product extracted from this common
   plant of the and regions of northern Mexico and Southwestern United
   States is the potent antioxidant nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). It
   was widely used during the 1950s as a food preservative and to preserve
   naturals fibers. Later it was banned after reports of toxicity during
   the early 1960s. Renal and hepatotoxicity are also reported for chronic
   use of creosote bush and NDGA. This article reviews traditional and
   contemporary uses and pharmacology, including toxicology of this plant
   widely used in Mexican traditional medicine. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {We investigated the adsorption of carbon monoxide on the MgO(100),
   MgO(100):Ni, and MgO(100):Cr surfaces, using an ab initio density
   functional cluster embedding approach. The relaxation and rumpling of
   the MgO surface were explored through potential energy curves. Then, the
   Mg adsorption site of sharp and rumpled surfaces was studied. Both local
   density and generalized gradient approximations were employed, and the
   orbitals were expanded as Gaussian atom-centered orbitals. It was found
   that the surface relaxes bulkward similar to 1.4\%, but Mg ions displace
   more toward the bulk than the oxygen ions, producing a surface rumpling
   of similar to 0.95\%. The energy obtained for CO adsorption on the pure
   MgO surface with the generalized gradient approximation using the
   Perdew-Wang (PW86) functional was as large as 1.6 kcal/mol. Finally, for
   all the systems studied in this work, the relaxed-rumpled surfaces
   showed a surface-CO adsorption energy larger than the sharp surfaces.

Abstract = {Neutron-rich radioactive ion beams available from the HRIBF allow a
   variety of measurements around the (132)Sn region, including Coulomb

   (132-136)Te and (126-134) Sn have been measured by Coulomb excitation in
   inverse kinematics. The results are discussed in terms of the shell
   model and the quasiparticle random phase approximation. Neutron transfer
   onto a (134)Te beam, from (9)Be and (13)C targets to populate
   single-particle states in (135)Te, has also been studied. Gamma rays
   from the (13)C((134) Te, (12)C) reaction were used to identify the
   vi(13/2) state in (135)Te, at an energy of 2109 keV. These and other
   results, and plans for future experiments with these neutron-rich beams,

   germanium isotopes Ge-78,Ge-80 and the closed neutron shell nucleus
   Ge-82 were measured at the HRIBF using Coulomb excitation in inverse
   kinematics. These data allow a study of the systematic trend between the
   subshell closures at N=40 and 50. The B(E2) behavior approaching N=50 is
   similar to the trend observed for heavier isotopic chains. A comparison
   of the experimental results with a shell model calculation demonstrates
   persistence of the N=50 shell gap and a strong sensitivity of the B(E2)
   values to the effective interaction.},

Abstract = {Let P be a point set with n elements in general position. A
   triangulation T of P is a set of triangles with disjoint interiors such
   that their union is the convex hull of P, no triangle contains an
   element of P in its interior, and the vertices of the triangles of T are
   points of P. Given T we define a graph G(T) whose vertices are the
   triangles of T, two of which are adjacent if they share an edge. We say
   that T is hamiltonean if G(T) has a hamiltonean path. We prove that the
   triangulations produced by Graham's Scan are hamiltonean. Furthermore we
   prove that any triangulation T of a point set which has a point adjacent
   to all the points in P (a center of T) is hamiltonean. (C) 2004 Elsevier

   in tangential, radial and transverse cuts of fresh material.
   Histochemistry and stem anatomy were studied on similar cuts previously
   softened in a solution of water-glicerol-PEG. Our results show that the
   anatomical patterns of bark and wood, as well as the histochemical
   patterns and specific gravity, are influenced by water accessibility and
   climate; these patterns could guarantee mechanical and anti-infection
   strategies to Support extreme conditions. Enzyme cytochemistry reveals
   biochemical activities probably related to lipid utilization routes for
   the lignification processes and for synthesis of extractives; these
   results suggest that the formation and maturation of woody tissue is
   very active at the beginning of the rainy season. These species are
   widely used by the local Population. Traditional uses include firewood,
   dead and live fences, fodder, construction, supporting stakes,
   handcrafts, farming tools, extraction of tanning products, and medicine.
   There is no relationship between use and abundance. Alternative uses are

Abstract = {The respiratory rates of Litopentieus stylirostris were measured at
   three different salinities (20, 30, and 40) and temperatures (20, 30,
   and 35 degreesC). Equations of routine oxygen consumption (VO2) and
   weight-specific oxygen consumption (QO(2)) were obtained for the nine
   combinations and regression models for the effects of temperatures and
   salinities were derived from the data. Temperature, salinity, and
   combinations of salinity and temperature had a significant effect on
   oxygen consumption rate (p>0.05). The lowest values were found at a
   salinity of 30, suggesting that the iso-osmotic point may be at about
   this value. The thermal coefficient (Q(10)) did not vary with salinity,
   but did vary with temperature. Q(10) was 0.62 between 20 and 30
   degreesC, 2.5 between 30 and 35 degreesC, and 1.88 over the full
   temperature range. The partial coefficients and the multiple regression
   equation were highly significant suggesting that culture of this species
   would be optimum at salinities between 25-38 and temperatures of 20-30
   degreesC. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed an unsurpassed effort aimed at
   reconstructing the history of life from the genetic information
   contained in extant organisms. The availability of many sequenced
   genomes has allowed the reconstruction of phylogenies from gene families
   and its comparison with traditional single-gene trees. However, the
   appearance of major discrepancies between both approaches questions
   whether horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played a prominent role in
   shaping the topology of the Tree of Life. Recent attempts at solving
   this controversy and reaching a consensus tree combine molecular data
   with additional phylogenetic markers. Translation is a universal
   cellular function that involves a meaningful, highly conserved set of
   genes: both rRNA and r-protein operons have an undisputed phylogenetic
   value and rarely undergo HGT. Ribosomal function reflects the concerted
   expression of that genetic network and consequently yields information
   about the evolutionary paths followed by the organisms. Here we report
   on tree reconstruction using a measure of the performance of the
   ribosome: antibiotic sensitivity of protein synthesis. A large database
   has been used where 33 ribosomal systems belonging to the three major
   cellular lineages were probed against 38 protein synthesis inhibitors.
   Different definitions of distance between pairs of organisms have been
   explored, and the classical algorithm of bootstrap evaluation has been
   adapted to quantify the reliability of the reconstructions obtained. Our
   analysis returns a consistent phylogeny, where archaea are
   systematically affiliated to eukarya, in agreement with recent
   reconstructions which used information-processing systems. The
   integration of the information derived from relevant functional markers
   into current phylogenetic reconstructions might facilitate achieving a
   consensus Tree of Life. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The locomotor activity of the crab Pseudothelphusa americana displays a
   circadian rhythm consisting of two main bouts, a morning (lights-on
   related) and an evening (lights-off related) bout. The aim of the
   present work is to elucidate whether each bout of activity displays
   similar phase response shifts when exposed to a 2 h light pulse (150
   lux). Phase shifts were evaluated in the free running rhythm under
   constant darkness from animals previously entrained to a light-dark
   regimen. Results obtained show that phase shifts are observed for both
   morning and evening peaks during the subjective day, while during the
   subjective night, only the evening peak of activity displays significant
   phase shifts. The aforementioned indicates that a multi-oscillatory
   system may drive the locomotor activity circadian rhythm in the fresh
   water crab Pseudothelphusa americana, and the differences in PRC shapes
   for evening and morning peaks could represent the light sensitivity of
   two different oscillators.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to detect the presence of estrogen receptor
   alpha in different cell subpopulations of the growing left and
   regressing right ovaries from newly hatched chicks, by
   immunohistochemical methods, using an indirect immunoperoxidase
   technique. Newly hatched chicks were killed by decapitation and the
   growing left and regressing right ovaries were removed and processed for
   histological and immunohistochemical studies. The percentage of estrogen
   receptor alpha (ERalpha) immunostained cells and the staining intensity
   were determined. Histological results demonstrated that the right ovary
   lacks cortex and is constituted by the medullary region, whereas the
   left ovary is composed by cortical and medullary compartments. The
   medullary region is similar in both ovaries and presents the same
   elements. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed ERalpha-positive cells
   in the left ovary, located in the nucleus of all cell subpopulations; in
   contrast, in the right ovary, only epithelial cells of the lacunar
   channels depicted estrogen receptors. The present findings indicate a
   cell-specific localization of ERalpha in left and right ovaries of newly
   hatched chick.},

Abstract = {In various species of crayfish it has been proposed that different
   extra-retinal photoreceptors and pacemakers could be involved in the
   photo entrainment mechanisms. The identity of the neural structures
   responsible for this phenomenon is not known. The objective of this work
   was to contribute to the knowledge of the neurophysiological mechanisms
   and structures underlying the biological clock of crayfish by studying
   c-fos induction in one of the neural structures proposed as a pacemaker,
   the brain. Using qualitative-quantitative immunohistochemical and image
   methods we identified light-induced c-Fos immunoreactivity in cells
   located in the median protocerebrum of the supraesophagic ganglion. The
   immunoreaction varied with circadian time. The protocerebrurn showed a
   statistically significant c-Fos induction, especially in neurons of the
   dorsal anterior region and the protocerebral bridge. A statistically
   significant difference between the control and the experimental
   conditions indicated a differential sensitivity in the early subjective
   night. This is the first report on c-Fos expression in crayfish and
   indicates that this marker may be a useful tool for studying the
   circadian clock in this organism.},

Abstract = {The different meanings and applications of the terms used to describe

   some investigators. The meaning of the terms ``lateral{''} and
   ``terminal{''} sometimes varies as used by different authors, as does
   the usage of ``paraphyses{''} and ``stalks.{''} For example, the
   position of the reproductive structure, lateral vs. terminal, and its
   relative position to the paraphyses, reproductive or vegetative
   filaments, and stalks have often not been clearly stated or defined. We
   propose restricted meanings and specific definitions for these terms in

   so that the full Navier-Stokes equations are transformed into three
   recurrence relations with two independent coefficients. The boundary
   conditions on the cylinder's surface are satisfied in trivially way, and
   the conditions at infinity lead to a system of two non linear ordinary
   differential equations. These are solved using Fourier series in the

Abstract = {The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) area family of zinc-containing
   endopeptidases that play a key role in both physiological and
   pathological tissue remodeling. Human fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1) was
   the first vertebrate collagenase purified as a protein and cloned as a
   cDNA, and is considered the prototype for all the interstitial
   collagenases. It is synthesized as a zymogen where N-terminal residues
   are removed by proteolysis and shares with other MMPs a catalytic domain
   and a carboxy terminal domain with sequence similarity to hemopexin.
   Importantly, MMP-1 should be considered a multifunctional molecule since
   it participates not only in the turnover of collagen fibrils in the
   extracellular space but also in the cleavage of a number of non-matrix
   substrates and cell surface molecules suggesting a role in the
   regulation of cellular behaviour. Furthermore, an extensive body of
   evidence indicates that MMP-1 plays an important role in diverse
   physiologic processes such as development, tissue morphogenesis, and
   wound repair. Likewise, it seems to be implicated in a variety of human
   diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary emphysema and
   fibrotic disorders, suggesting that its inhibition or stimulation may
   open therapeutic avenues. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {232-238},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An important question in conservation biology is the extent to which the
   number of taxonomic supraspecific categories can serve as surrogates of
   species richness. This issue has been little explored in highly diverse
   areas. We used 113 floristic inventories from throughout Mexico, a
   megadiverse country, to evaluate the potential of higher-taxon richness
   for predicting local species richness of vascular plants. This large
   biodiversity data set includes the main vegetation types found across
   the country. In all, 247 families, 2,398 genera, and 11,890 species were
   used for the analysis, representing 99.6\%, 90.2\%, and 53.2\% of the
   respective totals recorded in the country. We hypothesized that the
   number of genera and species would be accurately predicted by the
   richness of the higher taxon. To avoid getting spurious regressions
   resulting from the logical increase in lower-taxon richness as a higher
   taxon becomes richer, we calculated new response variables by
   subtracting from the number of elements in the lower taxon group the
   number of those in the higher taxon; these variables were ``excess
   species{''} (number of species minus number of genera or families) and
   ``excess genera{''} (number of genera minus number of families). Our
   results indicate that genera provide very effective surrogates for
   estimation of local species richness (R-2 = 0.85), whereas families have
   a more limited potential for this purpose ( R-2 = 0.64). The predictive
   capacity of the diversity of higher taxon increased when the analyses
   were constrained to particular vegetation types (maximum R-2 = 0.95 for
   genera). This surrogate method may be a valuable tool in locating and
   designing representative systems of protected areas for vascular plant
   diversity, especially in megadiverse countries, where conservation
   efforts are hindered by the lack of complete inventories and
   insufficient resources.},

   these and other spore features. For this study, the characteristics of
   the basidiospores of 14 taxa of Gomphales were examined, using both
   photonic and electronic microscopy. These examinations clearly
   demonstrated that spore ornamentation is a very variable character and
   data, such as the base shape of the spore and the hilar appendix,
   previously not considered in the taxonomy of this group, can be very
   informative at this level.},

   texts in Spanish, though there are only few thousands of them in

   argued that database containing a set of categorized SCPs facilitates
   several tasks of automatic NLP.. The research is based on a set of ca.

Title = {Immunocytochemical study of estrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF)

Abstract = {The localization and abundance of the estrogen receptor activation
   factor (E-RAF) and a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex
   containing three proteins, p32, p55 and p60, which interact with the
   nuclear estrogen receptor II (nER II), have been studied in rat
   endometrial epithelial cells by means of immunofluorescence and high
   resolution quantitative immunocytochemistry. In the cytoplasm E-RAF is
   associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the nucleus it is
   mainly localized at the interchromatin space, and surrounding the clumps
   of compact or semi-condensed chromatin. Quantitative analyses show that
   the abundance of E-RAF in the nucleus increases after ovariectomy and
   decreases 3 minutes after estradiol administration. These results are in
   agreement with the currently available biochemical data. Double
   immunolocalizations demonstrate that p32, p55, p60 co-localize with
   other splicing-related protein. High resolution immunolocalization shows
   that p32, p55, p60 are associated with perichromatin fibrils
   (co-transcriptional splicing) and with clusters of interchromatin
   granules (storage of splicing-related molecules). The nuclear abundance
   of the snRNP complex decreases with ovariectomy, increases within 3
   minutes after estradiol administration and remains higher than that in
   ovariectomized animals for 27 minutes.These results strongly support the
   previous data on the role of nER-II in the regulation of mRNA
   transcription and its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.},

Journal = {CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE},

Volume = {46},

Pages = {227-239},
Abstract = {Composition, abundance, and main assemblages of holoplanktonic
   polychaetes were analysed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. This Gulf, in
   Mexican waters of the eastern tropical Pacific, is a very productive
   system due to an upwelling during the winter. Zooplankton samples were
   taken over a station grid covering neritic and oceanic waters during
   March and November 1978. Most species showed their highest densities in
   the oceanic region. In the western Gulf, the area sampled in both
   seasons, mean polychaete abundance was higher in November (549.2
   ind.1000 m(-3)) than in March (143.8 ind.1000 m(-3)). A regression tree
   analysis showed that pH and dissolved oxygen were the main factors
   affecting the total polychaete abundance over the study area during
   March. Identified families were: Lopadorhynchidae (88.8\%), Alciopidae
   (6.6\%), Iospilidae (2.8\%), Tomopteridae (1. 1\%) and Typhloscolecidae
   (0.7\%). The dominant species, Pelagobia longicirrata, accounted for
   86.5\% of the total polychaete abundance. A Bray-Curtis analysis
   identified two main polychaete assemblages during March: ``oceanic{''}
   and ``neritic{''}. Species richness and mean polychaete abundance were
   higher in the ``oceanic{''} assemblage, and P. longicirrata, Plotohelmis
   capitata, Rhynchonerella gracilis and Lopadorhynchus henseni were the
   most frequent and abundant species in this assemblage. In the
   ``neritic{''} assemblage, the iospilids Phalacrophorus uniformis and
   Iospilus phalacroides registered the highest relative abundance. It is
   suggested that the structure of holoplanktonic polychaete assemblages
   could be determined by the feeding habits of the species and their
   tolerance to the variability in environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work is to automatically determine, in an
   unsupervised manner, Spanish prepositional phrases of the type
   preposition - nominal phrase - preposition (P-NP-P) that behave in a
   sentence as a lexical unit and their semantic and syntactic properties
   cannot be deduced from the corresponding properties of each simple form,
   e.g., por medio de (by means of), a fin de (in order to), con respecto a
   (with respect to). We show that idiomatic P-NP-P combinations have some
   statistical properties distinct from those of usual idiomatic

Abstract = {Litopenaeus vannamei were reared in close cycle over seven generations
   and tested for their capacity to digest starch and to metabolise glucose
   at different stages of the moulting cycle. After acclimation with 42.3\%
   of carbohydrates (HCBH) or 2.3\% carbohydrates (LCBH) diets and at high
   salinity (40 g kg(-1)) or low salinity (15 g kg(-1)), shrimp were
   sampled and hepatopancreas (HP) were stored. Total soluble protein in HP
   was a affected by the interaction between salinity and moult stages
   (p<0.05). Specific activity of alpha-amylase ranged from 44 to 241 U mg
   protein and a significant interaction between salinity and moult stages
   was observed (p>0.05), resulting in highest values at stage C for low
   salinity (mean value 196.4 U mg protein), and at D-0 in high salinity
   (mean value 175.7 U mg protein(-1)). Specific activity of
   alpha-glucosidase ranged between 0.09 and 0.63 U mg protein(-1), an
   interaction between dietary CBH and salinity was observed for the
   alpha-glucosidase (p<0.05) and highest mean value was found in low
   salinity-LCBH diet treatment (0.329 U mg protein). Hexokinase specific
   activity (range 9-113 mU mg protein(-1)) showed no significant
   differences when measured at 5 mM glucose (p>0.05). Total hexokinase
   specific activity (range 17-215 mU mg protein) showed a significant
   interaction between dietary CBH and salinity (p<0.05) with highest value
   (mean value 78.5 mU mg protein(-1)) found in HCBH-high salinity
   treatment, whereas in the other treatments the activity was not
   significantly different (mean value 35.93 mU mg protein(-1)). A
   synergistic effect of dietary CBH, salinity and moult stages over
   hexokinase IV-like specific activity was also observed (p<0.05). As
   result of this interaction, the highest value (135.5 +/- 81 mU ing
   protein(-1)) was observed in HCBH, high salinity at D-0 moult stage.
   Digestive enzymes activity is enhanced in the presence of high starch
   diet (HCBH) and hexokinase can be induced at certain moulting stages
   under the influence of blood glucose level. Perspectives are opened to
   add more carbohydrates in a growing diet, exemplifying the potential
   approach for less-polluting feed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Since the publication of the standard that describes the multi-language
   framework known as Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), it has been a
   challenge letting non class-based programming languages being run on the
   CLI. ECMAScript, being a prototype-based, object-oriented, functional
   programming language, belongs to this category. Running ECMAScript
   programs in the CLI will offer a scripting language with the efficiency
   of a strong typed language but keeping its dynamic nature. Features like
   first class functions, late binding, and dynamic objects are not
   included in CLI by default, so the purpose of this compiler is to show
   that those features can be implemented using the CLI. Among the
   characteristics that we measured are the ability to store functions in
   data structures, passing them as parameters and returning them as
   values, and the possibility of adding new properties to already defined
   objects. It's possible to implement first class functions as well as
   dynamic objects with a cost in the size of the code generated, but also
   increases the flexibility of the programs that make use of them,
   allowing the use of software patterns which are rarely used in
   conventional programming languages.},

Abstract = {Forest fire induce drastic, and sometimes extensive changes in the
   landscape. Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
   (AVHRR) operated by NOAA have been used in several studies of forest
   fire. Their features allow detection of active fires as hot-spots, the
   monitoring of vegetation condition, and estimation of land surface
   temperature (LST). Multitemporal analysis of Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST calculated from NOAA-AVHRR14 in the
   course of the four months (November to February) previous to the fire
   seasons (March to May) for the period 1996-2000 allowed to identify a
   set of the dynamic predictive variables by constructing a logistic model
   to assess the risk of forest fire over the central region of Mexico.
   Actual forest fires were detected as hot-spots on nighttime NOAA-AVHRR
   14 images from the four fire seasons (March to May) from 1997 to 2000.
   In addition, elevation, aspect, slope, vegetation type, and
   precipitation were selected as the static predictive variables of the
   model. The data base included 846 fires, and 869 random non-fire points
   from 1997-1999. During 2000 There were 143 forest fires, which were used
   to assess the accuracy of the model.},

   is proposed here based in rule and tree induction from codon usage of
   several organisms. It is shown that domain can be identified trough
   codon usage and a simple set of rules. Two methods were applied, CN2 and
   C4.5. Obtained rules describe data better than other methods, in the
   sense that are topological interpretable and have phenomenological

Abstract = {The adoption of Turing machines as a model of intelligence can be
   motivated by some assumptions, both mathematical and philosophical. In a
   previous paper we talked about the assumptions related to the
   possibility, the necessity, and the limits of representing problem
   solving by mechanical means. In this paper we discuss general
   assumptions that have to do with considerations of method. Among the
   assumptions, we start with the idea that mechanical intelligence can be
   seen as the application of some method. Specifically, TM's embody a
   method for information processing through syntactical transformation.
   Such transformation is achieved via following rules that specify a
   sequence of actions, and the specification of such rules must be
   unambiguous and have a certain indifference to time and the past. The
   specific assumptions about the method are that it is mechanical, finite,
   with identifiable results, disregarding in a certain sense time and
   space. We also discuss what might happen if the assumptions were to be
   rejected or weakened. We hope that tinkering with these assumptions will
   help to shed light on the import of alternative computational models.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to algorithm design and analysis that
   benefits from the OO characteristics of Java. It consists of first
   defining the inheritance structure of a collection of algorithms, at
   different levels of abstraction. Then, correctness proofs and complexity
   measures are designed for the various levels of abstraction. The goal is
   to prove as many properties as possible at each abstract level, assuming
   the implementations of the methods called upon will be correct. Thus,
   when a more specialized algorithm is derived from a more abstract one,
   proofs and complexity analysis can be reused, and simply need to be
   completed by proving that the properties assumed for the concrete
   methods indeed hold. The approach is illustrated with several
   inheritance trees: for sorting, graph algorithms, string matching, and
   network flow. Each tree, at the bottom of the hierarchy, yields
   well-known algorithms in the respective area. Instead of using
   pseudo-code to describe these trees, Java is used to make the process
   more precise and useful, encouraging the design and analysis of
   algorithms, and also experimentation with new variants. The
   implementation presented in this paper takes advantage of Java's
   organization to build the inheritance trees for the classes, and Java's
   interfaces, collections, comparators, and iterators. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {604-612},
Abstract = {Due to their relative rareness and restricted distribution, little is
   known about the ultrastructure Of ricilluleids. In particular, sense
   organs have not been the subject of electron microscopic research until
   now. Ricinuleids use their forelegs to explore their surroundings with
   tentative movements. The distal tarsomeres of legs I and 11 of two
   cavernicolous Mexican species, Pseudocellus pearsei from the Yucatan
   Peninsula and Pseudocellus boneti from Guerrero, were examined ill this
   Study with light microscopy, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). A Conspicuous feature of the distal tarsomeres of legs
   I and 11 is a single circular opening that extends as a deep tube-like
   pit into the tarsus. This pore organ is lacking in the 6-legged larvae.
   Comparable organs are present in Araneae, Scorpiones, Amblypygi and
   Anactinotrichida. The tarsal organs of the mentioned groups possess
   several types of sensilla (olfactory, thermo- and hygrosensitive and
   mechanosensitve). The pore organ is located in the distal third of the
   dorsal half of the tarsus. In longitudinal sections it shows a long oval
   shape. In cross sections it is nearly circular. The pore organ contains
   a large number of long, slightly curved setae. These setae are localized
   oil the bottom and the lower two thirds of the wall of the pit and
   project into the lumen. The Upper third of the wall is free of setae and
   show, folds which extend parallel to the opening. All setae inside the
   pit seem to be of the same type. In sections they show a complex inner
   structure and likely represent chemoreceptive wall pore single-walled
   (wp-sw) sensilla. This indicates a possible olfactory function. The pore
   organ is underlain by numerous gland cells which represent
   characteristics Of Unicellular ``class I{''} gland cells.},

Abstract = {The Harderian glands of rodents are large intraorbital exocrine glands
   with histologic organization that varies among mammalian species. Here
   we describe some ultrastructural and biochemical features of the
   Harderian gland in the Mexican volcano mouse Neotomodon alstoni alstoni,
   a species of restricted habitat. The Harderian glands from male and
   female adult mice were dissected, processed and embedded in Epon 812 for
   light and electron microscopy studies. Porphyrin and total lipids were
   biochemically determined. The macroscopic appearance of the Harderian
   gland is similar in the male and female. The gland is a bilobulate
   structure, situated in the orbit towards the posterior side of the
   eyeball, of whitish color and is surrounded by a connective tissue
   capsule. The male gland is slightly heavier (127 mg) than that of the
   female (113 mg). The Harderian gland shows a tubulo-alveolar
   organization and is composed exclusively of one type of secretory cells.
   No branched duct system within the gland was found. Adrenergic nerves
   endings and mast cell were observed in the interstices of the alveoli.
   Male and female glands produce similar levels of porphyrins.
   Triglyceride levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the female
   compared to the male. Abundance of lipids could induce corneal
   lubrication of the Harderian gland which may confer a protective and
   adaptative function to the volcano mouse in its natural habitat during
   the dry and cold seasons. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A new species of Pseudocurycea is described from cloud forests of the
   Sierra Madre Oriental of Puebla, Mexico. The new species is
   distinguished from all other Pseudoeurycea by its small size, stout
   body, short tail, large nostrils, presence of characteristic glandular
   convergent ridges on the pelvic region and the tail, and by its
   distinctive limb structure, with very small hands and feet that are
   extensively webbed and bear prominent but short and pointy middle
   digits. The only apparent close relative of this species is P.
   praecellens, from which it differs by the position and distribution of
   the dorsal and caudal glands, body proportions, nostril size and
   coloration. All specimens of the new species were found in cloud forest,
   under a canopy of Liquidambar, Quercus, and arborescent ferns, as well
   as in a coffee grove. The elevational range for the species is narrow,
   between 905 and 1400 m, unusually low elevations for Pseudoeurycea.},

Abstract = {The past five years have seen the arrival and extremely rapid expansion
   of West Nile virus (WNV) in the Western Hemisphere. The rapid sweep
   across North America has permitted little time for developing knowledge
   of the virus's potential impacts on wildlife in the New World. Given
   this information gap, we here summarize for the ornithological community
   what is known or can be anticipated for WNV's effect on bird communities
   in coming years. Our particular focus is on impacts of WNV on the
   conservation status of birds, the principal vertebrate reservoir for the
   virus.},

Abstract = {Feeding habits of the fishes Lutjanus peru and Lu janus guttatus
   (Pisces: Lutjanidae) of Guerrero, Mexico. Diet composition of the
   Pacific snapper (Lu janus peru) 130-684 mm fork length (FL) and the
   spotted snapper (Lu janus guttatus) 120-550 mm FL, was analyzed. Monthly
   samples were obtained from commercial landings in three regions off the
   coast of Guerrero, Mexico. Percentage by number (\%N), percentage by
   weight (\%W), and percentage of occurrence (\%O) were calculated for
   each prey and summarized as the index of relative importance. Both
   species are polyphagous predators feeding on a variety of prey:
   Sixty-eight prey items, mainly fish (\%W = 50.9), crustaceans (\%W =
   35.6), and mollusks (\%W = 7.2), were found in the stomach contents of
   L. peru, while 88 components were identified in the diet of L. guttatus,
   the most important prey being fish (\%W = 50.8) and crustaceans (\%W =
   43.4). Diet overlap between species is not significant (p < 0.05),
   indicating that competition for food is unlikely. Based on published
   values of the relative importance index, the diets of these Lutjanidae
   were analyzed considering different regions of the Pacific coast of
   Mexico and Costa Rica, and similarities among sites and species were
   discussed. The cluster analysis showed that similarities among species
   inhabiting in the same area are more important than within organisms of
   the same species living in different zones. Results suggest that prey
   availability rather than food selectivity, conditions the feeding
   behavior of these fish species.},

Abstract = {The boundary between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions has been
   delineated using different approaches, methods and taxa. Using a
   paribiogeographical approach, identification of nodes can help
   understand the dynamics and evolution of the boundary. We analysed the
   distribution patterns of 46 Mexican land mammal species belonging to the
   Nearctic biotic component and delineated generalized tracks and nodes,
   in order to determine the southernmost boundary of the Nearctic region
   in Mexico. We found six generalized tracks and nine nodes; the latter
   located largely in the Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican Volcanic
   Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur and Chiapas biogeographical provinces. The
   highlands of Chiapas were found to represent the southernmost area
   inhabited by Nearctic taxa. The other biogeographical provinces,
   together with the Sierra Madre Occidental and Balsas Basin provinces,
   represent the Mexican transition zone in the strict sense. Instead of a
   classic static boundary, this transition zone represents an
   evolutionarily `active' zone, where several speciation events have taken
   place in the past. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London.},

Abstract = {The pilisuctorid ciliate Conidophrys pilisuctor is recorded for the

   collected in Patzcuaro Lake, Michoacan, Mexico. The morphometrical data
   of several phases of its life cycle ( except free tomites) and of its
   prevalence on the host's body regions are presented. The pilisuctorid
   was observed attached exclusively to the setae of various appendages
   from which those of the pereiopods and antennae had the greatest
   prevalences. However, the results of v 2 tests show that there was not a
   homogeneous ciliate preference for the body regions of H. azteca. From
   the cluster analysis, several regions presented a greater degree of
   similarity according to prevalence and presence - absence of the
   ciliate. Some aspects are considered for the establishment of symbiosis.},

   and 11.8 MeV carbon ions. Supralinearity was suppressed by sensitising
   the TLD-100 chips following a pre-exposure/annealing treatment. HCP
   irradiations took place using a Pelletron accelerator at fluences that
   ranged from about 6 x 10(8) to 3 x 10(11) cm(-2) and from 3 x 10(7) to 1
   x 10(11) cm(-2) for protons and carbons, respectively. Results were
   compared to a Monte Carlo simulation of the Extended Track Interaction
   Model (ETIM) performed for each particle-energy combination.
   Experimental data show that the onset and behaviour of the HCP-TL
   fluence response function is weakly energy dependent for each ion type,
   in agreement with previously reported data of sensitised TLD-100
   irradiated with low energy helium ions. ETIM fails to predict this
   behaviour showing instead a strong energy dependence of the simulated
   HCP-TL fluence response function. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The translational energy is used to suggest the important transitions
   involved in the production of N+ in N-2(+) colliding with He and Ar at
   3.0 and 4.0 keV. From the energy spectra, interesting structures can be
   observed. The laboratory energy (LE) distribution of N+ was transformed
   to the center of mass (c.m.) assuming the N+ is isotropically emitted in
   the c.m. frame. For both cases, the most probable energy was observed
   with nearly zero kinetic energy released (0.32 +/- 0.04 eV for the He
   target and 0.39 +/- 0.05 eV for the Ar target). The transition was
   associated with the electronic excitation of the C(2)Sigma(u)(+) state,
   which predissociates in the continuum of the (2)Pi(u) and (2)Sigma(u)
   states, in agreement with the recent results obtained by electron impact
   dissociation and with a new device which combines imaging and
   time-of-flight resolved coincidence techniques. It is seen that the N+
   energy distribution for Ar has a wide secondary maxima, while for He, it
   is either slight or absent. This result is attributed to the
   dissociation of the D(2)Pi(g) state. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In this work, the transient conjugated heat transfer characteristics of
   a thin long vertical strip embedded in a porous medium has been studied
   using numerical and asymptotic techniques. The oscillatory
   nondimensional temperature evolution in the strip and the reduced
   Nusselt number at the top of the strip are obtained as a function of the
   Fourier number, Fo, which relates the fluctuating to the steady thermal
   penetration lengths. The numerical results of the root mean square of
   the fluctuating reduced Nusselt number have been obtained covering the
   complete transition from fast (Fomuch less than1) to slow (Fomuch
   greater than1) thermal oscillations. Asymptotic solutions are obtained
   in these two limits and compared with the numerical results.},

Abstract = {Cloud forests are distributed in the Neotropics, from northern Mexico to
   Argentina, under very specific ecological conditions, namely slopes with
   high humidity input from clouds and mist. Its distribution in
   Mesoamerica is highly fragmented, similar to an archipelago, and taxa
   are thus frequently represented as sets of isolated populations, each
   restricted to particular mountain ranges and often showing a high degree
   of divergence, both morphologically and genetically. The common
   bush-tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus, Aves Thraupidae) inhabits
   cloud forests from eastern and southern Mexico south to northwestern
   Argentina. Here we use 676 bp of mtDNA (around the ATPase 8 gene) to
   explore the genetic variation and phylogeographic structure of the
   Mexican populations of C ophthalmicus. Phylogenctic analyses of mtDNA
   sequences indicate deep genetic structure. Five major clades, which
   segregate according to geographic breaks, are identified (starting from
   the deepest one in the phylogeny): (1) Southern Chiapas and Northern
   Central America, (2) Tuxtlas massif, (3) Sierra Madre del Sur, (4)
   Eastern Oaxaca and Northern Chiapas, and (5) Sierra Madre Oriental. The
   long history of isolation undergone by each clade, as suggested by the
   phylogeny, implies that the species status of each of them should be
   revised. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multitemporal analysis of land surface temperature using NOAA-AVHRR:
   preliminary relationships between climatic anomalies and forest fires},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {25},
Number = {20},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-14 imagery was used to analyse changes
   in land surface temperature in an area of Central Mexico during the
   course of each dry season (November-April) for the period 1996-2000.
   Daily surface temperature was obtained by the split-window method and
   cloud-free monthly composites were subsequently built. This value was
   related to maximum air temperatures recorded at meteorological stations
   and to forest fires detected from night-time images. During 1996-1997
   and 1997-1998 (El Nino) dry seasons, monthly surface temperature ranged
   from 35degreesC to 46degreesC and from 33degreesC to 51degreesC,
   respectively; during 1998-1999 (La Nina) and 1999-2000 it was lower,
   ranging from 28degreesC to 47degreesC, and from 28degreesC to
   41degreesC, respectively. At the end of El Nino, land surface
   temperatures higher than 50degreesC were registered, and 730 forest
   fires were detected, suggesting that this temperature increment also
   contributed to the vulnerability of vegetation to fire. It is concluded
   that land surface temperature during the first four months of the dry
   season can be used as a variable for modelling the probability of forest
   fire occurrence, in combination with other environmental variables.
   Similarities between land surface temperature and maximum air
   temperature suggest the potential use of NOAA-AVHRR imagery for
   evaluating El Nino/LaNina effects on the continental surface.},

Abstract = {Based on the Kubo formalism, electronic transport in macroscopic
   quasiperiodic systems is studied by means of an efficient
   renormalization method, and the convolution technique is used in the
   analysis of two- and three-dimensional lattices. For the bond problem,
   we found a transparent state located at a center of self-similarity and
   its ac conductivity is qualitatively different from that observed in
   mixing Fibonacci chains. The conductance spectra of multidimensional
   systems exhibit a quantized behavior when the electric field is applied
   along a periodically arranged atomic direction, and it becomes a devil's
   stair if the perpendicular subspace of the system is quasiperiodic.
   Furthermore, the dc conductance maintains a constant value for small
   imaginary parts (eta) of the energy and decays when eta>eta(c), where
   eta(c) is proportional to the inverse of the system length. Finally, the
   spectrally averaged conductance shows a power-law decay as the system
   length grows, neither constant as in periodic systems nor exponential
   decays occurred in randomly disordered lattices, revealing the critical
   localization nature of the eigenstates in quasicrystals.},

Abstract = {External measurements and size differences between the sexes were
   examined in the coastal spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuata graffmani,
   in Bahia de Banderas, on the Mexican Pacific coast. The dolphins were
   collected by local fishermen and 29 external characteristics were
   measured by members of the Marine Mammals Laboratory, University of
   Mexico. The length of each characteristic with respect to total length
   was analysed through adjustment of the data to a power equation. A
   stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to the absolute values and to
   those expressed as proportions to analyse the differences between the
   sexes. Results indicate that growth in these dolphins is generally
   negatively allometric, and most of the characteristics measured were, in
   both absolute and proportional terms, greater in male dolphins than in
   female dolphins. As found in many species of odontocetes, the
   discriminant analysis showed that the main differences between the sexes
   for this coastal subspecies include the relative positions of the
   umbilicus, the genital aperture and the anus. The morphometric data
   provided by this study, corresponding to 29 specimens of S. a. graffmani
   collected in a restricted locality of the Mexican Pacific coast, are
   particularly interesting to studies documenting latitudinal
   morphological differences in the coastal spotted dolphin.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a complex disease of unknown etiology
   which produces a progressive and irreversible destruction of the
   alveolar-capillary units leading ultimately to death from respiratory
   failure. For a long time the pathogenesis of the disease was attributed
   to an unresolved chronic alveolitis. However, a growing body of evidence
   suggests that inflammation does not play a major role in this disease,
   and that the pivotal pathogenic mechanisms include epithelial cell
   microinjuries/activation, and fibroblast migration, proliferation, and
   differentiation in myofibroblasts fort-ning discrete foci in the injured
   areas. Active fibroblasts/myofibroblasts from these foci may in turn
   disturb alveolar re-epithelialization, by provoking basement membrane
   disruption and epithelial cell apoptosis finally resulting in
   exaggerated extracellular matrix accumulation. This aberrant repair
   process annihilates the lung architecture leading to the honeycomb
   remodeling.},

   - R + P and assimilated energy (As) as R + P. At the end of the growth
   experiment, shrimp immune response, oxyhemocyanin (OxyHc), osmotic
   pressure and digestive gland glycogen were measured. Dietary protein
   level enhanced ingestion rate in shrimp fed 5 g DP/kg BWd compared to
   shrimp fed 40 g DP/kg BWd. However, daily growth coefficient (DGC, \%)of
   L. vannamei juveniles was high in shrimp fed 40 g DP/kg BWd in
   comparison to shrimp fed 5 g DP/kg BWd. An inverse relation between
   wastes (H+ U) and dietary protein level was observed, indicating that
   shrimp loose 81\% of ingested energy when fed 5 g DP/kg BWd and only
   5.6\% when fed 40 g DP/kg BWd. A higher assimilation and production
   efficiency (P/As) was obtained when shrimp were fed 40 g DP/kg BWd than
   that obtained in shrimp fed 15 or 5 g DP/kg BWd and an inverse relation
   between R and respiratory efficiency (R/AS) in relation to dietary
   protein levels was also observed. An increase in OxyHc was observed with
   increasing dietary proteinlevels indicating that shrimp accumulated
   protein as hemocyanin. A reduction of hemocytes occurred when shrimp
   were fed sub-optimal dietary protein levels indicating that zymogens
   contained in hemocytes, i.e., prophenoloxidase (ProPO) system, peneidins
   and their activities (phagocytosis, coagulation), were also reduced. A
   reduction on respiratory burst was observed indicating that suboptimal
   dietary protein level affected the number of cells and the phagocytosis
   capacity of cells. Notwithstanding, the compensatory mechanism used by
   L. vannamei to respond nutritional stress, sub-optimal dietary protein
   level (5 and 15 g DP/kg BWd) induced not only a severe reduction in
   growth rate and assimilation efficiency but also in immune capacities.

Abstract = {The effect of an inert gas pressure on the structure of selenium thin
   films has been systematically investigated in the pulsed laser
   deposition process. The ablated material is deposited on Au (111) gold
   thin films for its characterization by atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   Analysis of the surface morphology shows that instead of the formation
   of a uniform Se thin film on top of Au (111) terraces, as it occurs in
   high vacuum, the film grows as two dimensional ellipsoid shaped
   aggregates. The size of these Se aggregates increases significantly with
   the gas pressure and reaches a maximum at pressures of similar to1.5
   Torr, and subsequently decreases with further increase of the gas
   pressure. This effect is probably due to the fact that the kinetic
   energy of the impinging species decreases as pressure increases, thus
   impeding diffusion on the substrate surface. However, further increase
   in the pressure prevents the Se species from being deposited on the
   substrate resulting in a decrease in size of the aggregates.},

Abstract = {The amounts of energy channeled into growth (P), maintenance (R),
   excretion (U) and exuviae (E,) were quantified in six dietary treatments
   during early postlarval development in Litopenaeus setiferus and
   Litopenaeus vannamei reared at 28 +/- 1 degreesC and 35 +/- 1\%
   salinity. The six diet combinations were: (1) freshly hatched Artemia
   nauplii, (2) freshly hatched Artemia nauplii supplemented with algae,
   (3) microparticulate commercial diet (MCD), (4) MCD supplemented with
   algae, (5) Artemia nauplii partially substituted (50\%) by MCD and (6)
   Artemia nauplii partially substituted (50\%) by MCD supplemented with
   algae. Oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion and dry weight were
   measured from postlarvae day I (PL1) to PL10 (I to 10 days after
   metamorphosis). Energy distribution in both species was affected by diet
   with significantly higher proportion of energy allocated into production
   (1.49 J day(-1) for L. setiferus and 1.77 J day(-1) for L. vannamei)
   when animals were fed a mixed diet. The proportion of assimilated energy
   channeled into production (P/As) was greater when both species were fed
   mixed diet and was lower when fed on MCD alone or MCD plus algae. On the
   contrary, the proportion of assimilated energy used in respiration (R/A)
   was higher for both species when fed on MCD alone or MCD plus algae,
   with the lowest values in animals fed on the mixed diet. Low values of
   net growth efficiency (K-2) were found in both species when the main
   food was MCD (alone or supplemented with algae), with the highest K-2
   when animals were fed the mixed diet. Results show that divergences
   between these two species during early postlarval stages only appear
   when animals were in a poor physiological condition due to an
   inefficient diet. Artemia nauplii, partially substituted by MCD with a
   supplement of algae, integrated a high-quality diet for both species
   producing high net growth efficiency. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {FLOR1 is a flower-specific leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein that
   interacts in vitro with the MADS box protein AGAMOUS. However, FLOR1
   belongs to the plant-specific (PS) subfamily of LRR proteins which are
   thought to be extracellular based on immunolocalization experiments with
   one of them and the presence of a hydrophobic signal peptide in the
   N-terminus of all of them. As a first step towards exploring the
   possible in vivo role of the AG-FLOR1 interaction, we show here that
   FLOR1 mRNA in wild type Arabidopsis thaliana is specific to
   inflorescence, meristems, floral meristems, stamens and carpels with a
   spatio-temporal mRNA expression pattern during flower development that
   is similar to that of AGAMOUS. To confirm FLOR1 transcription expression
   in meristems, stamens and carpels, its mRNA pattern of expression was
   studied in mutants of floral meristem or floral organ identity genes
   (LEAFY, APETALA 1, CAULIFLOWER, AGL8, APETALA2, and APETALA3).
   Furthermore, immunolocalization experiments show that the FLOR1
   transcript and protein have similar expression patterns. Light and
   electron micrographs of immunolocalization experiments, as well as GFP
   cellular localization in transgenic A. thaliana lines expressing
   FLOR1-GFP chimeric proteins suggest that FLOR1 is localized in the
   cytoplasm and nucleus inside cells. These results contrast with previous
   reports that suggest that other members of the same PS LRR subfamily are
   only localized in the extracellular space. The functional relevance of
   our findings in terms of the possible in vivo interaction of FLOR1 and
   AGAMOUS are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {Indicators of physiological and immunological status of Litopenaeus
   setiferus wild populations (Crustacea, Penaeidae)},

Abstract = {Constant environmental changes in oceanic and estuarine systems due to
   human activity in coastal zones require different tools and strategies
   for their study to be able to assess the health status of aquatic
   ecosystems. The Gulf of Mexico has a tremendous ecological importance
   because of its biological diversity. Baseline levels of blood
   metabolites and immune components were defined for wild tropical
   populations of Litopenaeus setiferus, an important shrimp species of the
   Gulf of Mexico. Osmotic pressure, oxy hemocyanin (OxyHc), glucose,
   proteins, cholesterol, lactate, and triacylglycerols (TAG) were used as
   indicators of physiological status; pro phenoloxydase (proPO) and
   phenoloxydase (PO) quantification of hemocytes, as well as respiratory
   burst, were used to assess the immunological status. Significant
   differences were observed in live weight of juveniles, males, and
   females of L. setiferus with mean values of 10.54, 35.05, and 40.33) g,
   respectively. A value of 460 mOsm/kg was recorded in the water where
   Juveniles were sampled and 1,000 mOsm/kg in adult sampling zones.
   Consequently, the osmotic pressure of L. setiferus juveniles (718.02
   mOsm/kg) was 22\% lower than in adults (925 mOsm/kg); there were no
   differences between sexes. A significantly lower value in Juvenile OxyHc
   was observed. This value was 24 and 16\% lower than that observed in
   males and females, respectively. Hemolymph glucose, cholesterol, and
   triacylglycerol levels were not statistically different between shrimp
   stages, showing median values of 0.19, 0.32, and 0.39 mg/ml of glucose,
   cholesterol, and triacylglycerols, respectively. Hemocyanin was
   distributed normally in the juvenile male population but not in females.
   A proportion between 52 to 81\% of OxyHc of the total protein
   (OxyHc/Prot) was obtained for all stages. Digestive gland glycogen
   showed no normal distribution in juveniles and adults. Digestive gland
   glycogen was significantly higher in Juveniles (median value of 2.64
   mg/g) than in adults (median value of 1.58 mg/g). A higher value of
   lactate (0.11 mg/ml) was observed in juveniles than in males (0.09
   mg/ml) and females (0.04 mg/ml). Granular cells (GC) corresponded to 36,
   44, and 39\% of the total hemocytes (TH) observed in Juveniles, males,
   and females. ProPO showed no normal distribution in all stages. A high
   proPO activity was recorded in L. setiferus females that was 95\% higher
   than in the juvenile-male group. Respiratory burst was divided into two
   groups, juveniles-males and females, and was distributed normally in
   both. Female respiratory burst values were 40 and 45\% higher than those
   observed in the juvenile and male groups, respectively. There was an
   increment in OxyHc, proteins, PO, hemocytes, and respiratory burst with
   an increase in body weight. In contrast, the relationship of live weight
   to glucose, TAG, and proPO revealed no significant regressions. A
   significant decrease in cholesterol, glycogen, and lactate with an
   increase in body weight was also observed. We now have indicators of
   nutritional and immune status of juveniles and adults that can reveal
   changes in trophic relations and health at the population level. This
   will serve as a basis for using L. setiferus as environmental sentinels,
   as non-controversial and inexpensive models to evaluate the potential
   changes that human activities could exert on this important marine
   ecosystem.},

Abstract = {The global matrix techniques are used in the analysis of the
   Stark-Ladder resonances for transverse horizontal and surface waves in
   piezoelectric multilayers. Stark-Ladder resonances are observed when
   these waves propagate inside composites consisting of N piezoelectric
   layers whose piezoelectric properties obey a special linear relation.
   Each layer is made of materials with hexagonal 6 mm symmetry. The
   resonances are studied through the transmission coefficient. The
   transmission coefficient shows the well known band structure for a
   periodic piezocomposite, and when a linear term in the values of the
   piezoelectric parameters of the layers (which breaks the periodicity) is
   added, the band structure is destroyed and, in certain cases, resonances
   of the Stark-Ladder type are shown. The transmission coefficient is
   studied as a function of the properties of the materials and angle of
   incidence of the waves. Numerical results for two different
   configurations of piezocomposites are presented, one of them showing the
   existence of Stark-Ladders resonances. An analysis of the resonance
   spectrum is given. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Several cDNAs encoding ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
   activase (Rubisco activase, RCA) were isolated from a maize (Zea mays
   L.) leaf cDNA library. Although all the cDNAs encoded the same
   polypeptide, the RCA 0 isoform, they showed two different
   downstream-like elements (DST-like) at their 3' untranslated regions
   (UTRs). The Zmrca1 cDNAs had the subdomain I, and II and the Zmrca2
   cDNAs, besides these subdomains, showed two repeats of the subdomain
   III. The presence of at least two different rca genes in the maize
   genome was demonstrated by Southern, and by PCR analysis using primers
   specific for the two cDNAs. Northern analysis with probes specific! for
   each gene showed that the Zmrca2 was expressed as a 1.8 kb transcript,
   the Zmrca1 corresponded to a 1.4 kb transcript, and a 1 kb band was a
   stable degradation product of one or both transcripts. Although both
   mRNAs showed cyclic variations during a day/night period, with their
   highest levels before dawn, the Zmrca2 transcript showed stronger
   changes than the Zmrca1 transcript, presenting a twofold larger highest
   to lowest RNA accumulation ratio than the Zmrca1 transcript, implying
   that they have different turnover rates. Our results suggest that
   post-transcriptional mechanisms, mediated by the DST-like element might
   be involved in the circadian expression of the maize rca transcripts.

Abstract = {A comparative chemical analysis of Agastache mexicana subsp. mexicana

   other species of Agastache. However, GS-MS analyses showed that methyl

   essential oils of A. mexicana subsp. mexicana, while pulegone, menthone
   and isopulegone were the major constituents found in A. mexicana subsp.
   xolocotziana. Furthermore, a different composition was found in their
   respective hexane extracts. These chemical composition dissimilarities
   between the two taxa support their recognition as distinct subspecies.

   protect against susceptibility in pigeon breeders' disease},
Journal = {THORAX},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Background: Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) play a major
   role in extracellular matrix turnover in the lung. However, in chronic
   lung disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pigeon
   breeders' disease (PBD), TIMPs may promote an adverse non-degradative
   environment. We hypothesised that polymorphisms in TIMP-3 could affect
   susceptibility to IPF and PBD.
   Methods: Two promoter variants, -915A>G and -1296T>C, were genotyped in
   323 healthy subjects, 94 subjects with IPF, 115 with PBD, and 90 exposed
   to avian antigen but without PBD. The severity of fibrosis in lung
   tissue and the clinical outcome after 1 year was determined in the PBD
   group.
   Results: The variants did not influence susceptibility to IPF, but the
   rare alleles of both variants appeared to be protective against
   susceptibility to PBD ( odds ratio ( OR) for carriage of at least one
   rare allele from either variant 0.48, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.76, p = 0.002).
   Haplotype analysis of positions -915 and -1296 estimated four
   haplotypes: {*}A{*}T, {*}G{*}T, {*}A{*}C and {*}G{*}C, respectively.
   Their frequencies differed overall between subjects with PBD and healthy
   subjects (p = 0.0049) and this was attributable primarily to the
   {*}G{*}C haplotype (OR 0.53, 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.77, p = 0.001). The
   severity of fibrosis correlated with poorer outcome in the PBD group (r
   = 0.73, p<0.01) but no relationship was seen between the {*}G{*}C
   haplotype and outcome or fibrosis. However, PBD subjects with the
   {*}G{*}C haplotype did have proportionally fewer lymphocytes in their
   bronchoalveolar fluid than those with the common {*}A{*}T haplotype (p =
   0.029).
   Conclusions: TIMP-3 variants appear to contribute to susceptibility to
   PBD. This may be through the inflammatory reaction rather than the
   fibrotic reaction.},

Abstract = {The composition, distribution, and main assemblages of chaetognath
   species were examined throughout an annual cycle in Bahia de Banderas,
   Mexico. Zooplankton sampling was carried out during five seasons (1989
   and 1991), using a 50 cm diameter and 1.5 m long conical net with a 505
   pm mesh size. The abundance of chaetognaths in each season was subjected
   to a Factor Correspondence Analysis (FCA) in order to identify the main
   assemblages. A total of 4142 individuals was sorted out from samples,
   and seven species were identified: Sagitta euneritica (Alvarino, 1961),
   Sagitta neglecta Aida, 1897, Sagitta inflata Grassi, 1881, Sagitta
   bedoti Beraneck, 1895, Sagitta pacifica (Tokioka, 1940), Sagitta minima
   Grassi, 1881, and Krohnitta pacifica (Aida, 1897). Sagitta euneritica
   was the most abundant and widely distributed species throughout the
   study area. The FCA defined two chaetognath groups, the ``euneritic
   assemblage{''} and the ``mixed assemblage,{''} whose differences were

Abstract = {Porous silicon has been studied extensively due to the interesting
   luminous properties that it displays. However, amorphous porous silicon,
   ap-Si, is an elusive material difficult to produce and study. Since
   ap-Si can be visualized as highly defective a-Si we have applied our new
   thermal process, based on an ab initio molecular dynamics method that
   uses the Harris functional, to generate samples of ap-Si with 50\%
   porosity starting with a cubic periodic supercell of 216 atoms, from
   which a porous cell was carved out. The randomizing process was done
   using a 7.5 fs time step and after the various structures were obtained,
   their optical gaps were determined. We find that the gaps increase
   monotonically with the randomness of the structure from 0.004 to 0.580
   eV. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have recently developed a procedure to amorphize structures of some
   semiconducting elements starting from cubic supercells. This procedure
   includes the use of an ab initio computer code based on the Harris
   functional, 64 or 216 atoms in the originally crystalline supercells,
   and a thermal procedure that heats the samples to just below their
   corresponding melting temperature. Here we report the use of non-cubic
   supercells: the graphitic hexagonal (72 atoms) and rhombohedral (108
   atoms) supercells, both with a density rho = 2.239 g/cm(3). The
   rhombohedral form is metastable whereas the hexagonal form is stable. We
   find that the radial distribution functions as well as the atomic
   topologies are similar in both cases, indicating that the symmetry of
   the initial crystalline structure does not affect the final amorphized
   samples. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The evolution of migration has long been considered complex and recent
   work has demonstrated additional complexity: some species follow the
   same ecological conditions throughout the year, whereas others `switch
   niches' between breeding and wintering ranges. Hypotheses regarding the
   evolution of migration would generally predict niche-following as
   primitive, and niche-switching as derived. However, no test has, to our
   knowledge, yet determined the directionality of evolution of these
   states within a lineage. We present an analysis of phylogenetic
   dimensions of seasonal niches in the Passerina buntings that indicates
   greater evolutionary change in the niches of breeding populations than
   among those of wintering populations. These results are consistent with
   hypotheses of (i) niche conservatism (in winter, at least) across a
   recently speciated lineage; and (ii) the derived state of the breeding
   (rather than winter) ecological niches of each species.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Question: Which is the response of the evergreen Quercus ilex and the
   deciduous Q. cerrioides to repeated disturbances?
   Location: central Catalonia (northeastern Spain), in the areas affected
   by two of the largest historically recorded wildfires in NE Spain: the
   Bages-Bergueda fire (24 300 ha forested area burned in July 1994), and
   the Solsones fire (14 300 ha burned in 1998).
   Methods: Survival and growth of individuals of Quercus ilex and Q.
   cerrioides were evaluated in plants subjected to different fire
   histories and experimental disturbances (burning, cutting or clipping)
   applied either before or after summer.
   Results: Survival was high (> 99\%), with both species showing a similar
   high resistance to disturbances. Growth after experimental disturbance
   was positively related to the size of the individual before the latest
   forest fire occurred. Fire history had a large effect on resprout
   growth, as the repeated incidence of disturbances lowered the capacity
   of individuals to grow. The type and season of experimental disturbance
   experienced by plants had a large effect. Individuals that experienced
   total above-ground loss had lower growth rates than those with partial
   loss. A similar pattern was observed in individuals disturbed after the
   summer in relation to those disturbed before summer.
   Conclusions: The larger growth rates recorded in Q. cerrioides across
   all fire histories and experimental treatments, and the higher
   vulnerability of Q. ilex to increased fire frequency, intensity of
   experimental disturbance, and disturbance season, provide evidence for
   the relatively high susceptibility of the latter to repeated
   disturbances. This view disagrees with the larger resilience of this
   species compared to co-existing deciduous oaks, as reported.},

Abstract = {The effect of density and sex ratio on maturation and spawning in the

   stocking densities were tested: 10 org/m(2) (5 females/m(2)), 20
   org/m(2) (15 females/m(2)), 34 org/m(2) (29 females/m(2)), 49 org/m(2)
   (44 females/m(2)) and 64 org/m(2) (59 females/m(2)), and five sex ratios
   (male/female) 1:1, 1:3, 1:6, 1:9 and 1:12. The Maturation Index (MI)
   results exhibited no significant differences between the high-density
   treatments, though there was a significant difference between these and
   the lowest density treatment. Females in the lowest density did not
   mature or spawn. The Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) showed no differences
   between densities, with high values in all treatments. Spawning
   increased in direct relation to density with the highest spawning
   percentage recorded in the highest density treatment. Density had a
   clear and significant effect on maturation and spawning in P. Ilamasi.

Abstract = {(T)he Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) is the most
   important shrimp species cultivated in the Americas. More than 90\% of
   the shrimp cultivated in 1998 on the American continent (132000 tons)
   was L. vannamei. L. vannamei is the species cultivated especially in
   Ecuador and Mexico. Its growth potential is quite good and it is a hardy
   species in spite of virus diseases, such as IHHN or, to a certain
   extent, other pathogens such as WSSv (depending on pond management).
   Regarding feed, it represents the species with the best opportunity at
   reduced protein level; plant protein and carbohydrates available in
   their habitat to be channeled into tissue. A review of some requirements
   of juveniles is provided while emphasis is put on cost reduction, pond
   utilization and, generally speaking, on sustainable production. From an
   experimental point of view, nutritional requirements for protein,
   copper, zinc, calcium, phosphorous and some vitamins are examined based
   on data accumulated by Texas A\&M, Ifremer/COP/Tahiti, Ifremer/Brest,
   UNAM/Mexico, and several other research centers. Pond production results
   are extended to pens or ponds as well as to some feeding aspects in
   large semi-intensive ponds or super-intensive conditions. Experiments
   conducted with a ``bacterial flock{''} (moulinettes) evidenced the
   beneficial role of bacteria.
   If temperature is around 27 degreesC, it is feasible to target for a
   double crop a year. A well-balanced feed, in super-intensive culture is
   achieved without use of additives (probiotics, immunostimulants). L.
   vannamei is the species in which most research has been concentrated to
   understand better shrimp nutrition and physiology, and in which the
   relationship between nutrition and genetics can currently be studied
   thanks to the existence of highly inbred strains. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {223-270},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This work represents the first phylogenetic analysis of all genera
   belonging to the plant family Theaceae (sensu lato). The study is based
   on 60 morphological characters derived from herbarium specimens and an
   extensive literature review of 37 genera (including the outgroup). In
   contrast to the results from molecular data, Theaceae is here found to
   consist of one clade in which the recognition of two families or
   subfamilies would leave Theaceae s.s. paraphyletic. Within that clade,
   Ternstroemiaceae is supported as monophyletic and includes Adinandra,
   Anneslea, Archboldiodendron, Balthasaria, Cleyera, Eurya, Euryodendron,
   Ficalhoa, Freziera, Symplococarpon, Ternstroemia and Visnea. The
   paraphyletic Theaceae s.s. includes Apterosperma, Camellia, Dankia,
   Gordonia, Pyrenaria, Schima, and Stewartia. Tetrameristaceae
   (Pentamerista and Tetramerista) are supported as a monophyletic family,
   with Pellicieraceae (Pelliciera) as sister group, and that clade is
   sister to the rest of the taxa. Bonnetiaceac (Archytaea and Bonnetia)
   and Kielmeyeroideae of the Clusiaceae (Caraipa, Haploclathra,
   Kielmeyera, Mahurea, Marila, and Neotatea) are also supported as
   monophyletic. Given the differences between the results obtained from
   morphological and molecular data, we consider that there is still a need
   for further research, including combined analyses. (C) 2004 The Willi

Journal = {HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {40},
Number = {8},
Pages = {593-602},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the cooling process of a vertical thin plate
   originated by a fluid-saturated porous medium, taking into account the
   effects of both longitudinal and transversal heat conduction in the
   plate. Due to the finite thermal conductivity of the plate, a
   longitudinal temperature gradient arises within it, which prevents any
   similarity solution in the boundary layer, changing the mathematical
   character of the problem from parabolic to elliptic, for large values of
   the suitable Rayleigh number. The energy balance equations are reduced
   to a system of two differential equations with two parameters: the
   nondimensional plate thermal conductivity alpha and the aspect ratio of
   the plate epsilon. In order to obtain the evolution of the temperature
   of the plate as a function of time and position, the coupled balance
   equations are integrated numerically for several values of the
   parameters, including the cases of very good and poor conducting plates.
   The results obtained, are compared with an asymptotic analysis based on
   the multiple scales technique carried out for the case of a very good
   conducting plate. There is at the beginning a fast transient in
   nondimensional time scale of order alpha followed by a slow
   nondimensional time scale of order unity, which gives the evolution of
   the cooling process. Good agreement is achieved even for values of the
   conduction parameter alpha of order unity. The asymptotic solution
   allows us to give closed form analytical solution for the plate
   temperature evolution in time and space. The overall thermal energy of
   the plate decreases faster for smaller values of alpha.},

Title = {Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles energetic balance and

Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {236},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {431-450},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of dietary protein
   level on survival, assimilation efficiency and immunological condition
   of Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles using two protein levels in a range of
   optimal reported levels of 15\% and 40\% (equivalent to 15 and 40 g
   DP/kg body weight/day {[}a DP/kg BWd]) and one extremely low (5\%
   equivalent to 5 g DP/kg BWd). In order to reach this goal, effects of
   dietary protein level on energetic balance were recorded by ingestion
   rate (I), respiratory rate (R) and biomass production of L. vannamei
   during its growing process (P). Energy lost from feces (H) and urine
   products (U) was calculated as (H+U)=I-R+P and assimilated energy (As)
   as R+P. At the end of the growth experiment, shrimp immune response,
   oxyhemocyanin (OxyHc), osmotic pressure and digestive gland glycogen
   were measured. Dietary protein level enhanced ingestion rate in shrimp
   fed 5 g DP/kg BWd compared to shrimp fed 40 g DP/kg BWd. However, daily
   growth coefficient (DGC, \%)of L. vannamei juveniles was high in shrimp
   fed 40 a DP/kg BWd in comparison to shrimp fed 5 g DP/kg BWd. An inverse
   relation between wastes (H+U) and dietary protein level was observed
   indicating that shrimp loose 81\% of ingested energy when fed 5 g DP/kg
   BWd and only 5.6\% when fed 40 g DP/kg BWd. A higher assimilation and
   production efficiency (P/As) was obtained when shrimp were fed 40 g
   DP/kg BWd, than obtained in shrimp fed 15 or 5 g DP/kg BWd and an
   inverse relation between R and respiratory efficiency (R/As) in relation
   to dietary protein levels was also observed. An increase in OxyHc was
   observed with increasing dietary protein levels indicating that shrimp
   accumulated protein as hemocyanin. A reduction of hemocytes occurred
   when shrimp were fed sub-optimal dietary protein levels indicating that
   zymogens contained in hemocytes, i.e., prophenoloxidase (ProPO) system,
   peneidins and their activities (phagocytosis, coagulation), were also
   reduced. A reduction on respiratory burst was observed indicating that
   sub-optimal dietary protein level affected the number of cells and the
   phagocytosis capacity of cells. Notwithstanding, the compensatory
   mechanism used by L. vannamei to respond nutritional stress, sub-optimal
   dietary protein level (5 and 15 g DP/kg BWd) induced not only a severe
   reduction in growth rate and assimilation efficiency but also in immune
   capacities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An artificial diet for shrimp larvae was microencapsulated with a

   was fed to mysis alone, as a co-feed with the microalgae Chaetoceros
   cerastosporum and Tetraselmis chuii (mixed) and compared with a live
   diet (control) of C. cerastosporum, T. chuii and Artemia nauplii. No
   significant differences (P > 0.05) were detected in growth rates,
   development and quality indexes of larvae fed the three experimental
   diets. All diets supported survival percentages of >90\%. Shrimp larvae
   fed MD and mixed diets had higher specific trypsin activity and soluble
   protein content than those fed live diet. Amylase activity decreased in
   larvae fed the mixed and MD apparently due to the carbohydrate
   composition of the diet. The results indicate that it is possible to

Abstract = {We present a density functional theory (DFT) calculation in the
   generalized gradient approximation to study the possibility for the
   existence of Jahn-Teller (JT) or pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) type local
   distortions in the La-Ba-Cu-O superconducting system. We performed the
   calculation and correspondingly group theory classification of the
   electronic ground state of the CuO6-10 elongated octahedra cluster,
   immersed in a background simulating the superconductor. Part of the
   motivation to do this study is that the origin of the apical deformation
   of the CuO6-10 cluster is not due to a pure JT effect, having therefore
   a non a priori condition to remove the degeneracy of the electronic
   ground state of the parent regular octahedron. We present a comparative
   analysis of the symmetry classified electron spectrum with previously
   reported results using unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations (UHF).
   Both the DFT and UHF calculations produced a non-degenerate electronic
   ground state, not having therefore the necessary condition for a pure JT
   effect. However, the appearance of a degenerate E-g state near to the
   highest occupied molecular orbital in the DFT calculation, suggests the
   possibility for a PJT effect responsible for a local distortion of the
   oxidized CuO6-9 cluster.},

Title = {Multidimensional dependency measures},

Abstract = {The problem of dependency between two random variables has been studied
   throughly in the literature. Many dependency measures have been proposed
   according to concepts such as concordance, quadrant dependency, etc.
   More recently, the development of the Theory of Copulas has had a great
   impact in the Study of dependence of random variables specially in the
   case of continuous random variables. In the case of the multivariate
   setting, the study of the strong mixing conditions has lead to
   interesting results that extend some results like the central limit
   theorem to the case of dependent random variables.
   In this paper, we study the behavior of a multidimensional extension of
   two well-known dependency measures, finding their basic properties as
   well as several examples. The main difference between these measures and
   others previously proposed is that these ones are based on the
   definition of independence among n random elements or variables,
   therefore they provide a nice way to measure dependency.
   The main purpose of this paper is to present a sample version of one of
   these measures, find its properties, and based on this sample version to
   propose a test of independence of multivariate observations. We include
   several references of applications in Statistics. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Chloroplast biogenesis genes act cell and noncell autonomously in
   early chloroplast development},
Journal = {PLANT PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {135},
Number = {1},
Pages = {471-482},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In order to identify nuclear genes required for early chloroplast
   development, a collection of photosynthetic pigment mutants of
   Arabidopsis was assembled and screened for lines with extremely low
   levels of chlorophyll. Nine chloroplast biogenesis (clb) mutants that
   affect proplastid growth and thylakoid membrane formation and result in
   an albino seedling phenotype were identified. These mutations identify
   six new genes as well as a novel allele of cla1. clb mutants have less
   than 2\% of wild-type chlorophyll levels, and little or no expression of
   nuclear and plastid-encoded genes required for chloroplast development
   and function. In all but one mutant, proplastids do not differentiate
   enough to form elongated stroma thylakoid membranes. Analysis of mutants
   during embryogenesis allows differentiation between CLB genes that act
   non cell autonomously, where partial maternal complementation of
   chloroplast development is observed in embryos, and those that act cell
   autonomously, where complementation during embryogenesis is not
   observed. Molecular characterization of the noncell autonomous clb4
   mutant established that the CLB4 gene encodes for
   hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS), the next to
   the last enzyme of the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for
   the synthesis of plastidic isoprenoids. The noncell autonomous nature of
   the clb4 mutant suggests that products of the MEP pathway can travel
   between tissues, and provides in vivo evidence that some movement of MEP
   intermediates exists from the cytoplasm to the plastid. The isolation
   and characterization of clb mutants represents the first systematic
   study of genes required for early chloroplast development in
   Arabidopsis.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in the Chiapas Highlands, a tropical mountain
   region where traditional agricultural practices have resulted in a
   mosaic landscape of forest fragments embedded in a matrix of secondary
   vegetation and crop fields. The question addressed was how may woody
   species richness be affected by forest fragment attributes derived from
   traditional land-use patterns. Species inventories of total woody
   species, canopy and understorey trees, and shrubs were obtained in 22
   forest fragments ( greater than or equal to5 ha). Multiple regression
   analyses were applied to examine the effects of size, matrix, isolation
   and shape of the forest fragments on richness of these species guilds.
   Fragment size was correlated with shape (r = 0.75) and isolation ( r = -
   0.69), and isolation was correlated with shape ( r = - 0.75). Total
   species richness, and number of shrubs and understorey trees in
   fragments were related to isolation; moreover, additive effects of
   fragment shape were found for shrubs. The number of canopy species was
   not related to any fragment variable. Matrix did not help to explain
   species richness, possibly due to the landscape structure created by the
   traditional land-use patterns. In addition to size and isolation, we
   point out the need of considering shape and matrix as additional
   fragmentation attributes, along with social and economic factors, if we
   are ever going to be successful in our management and conservation
   actions.},

Abstract = {A study was done of the effect of three water temperatures (16, 21 and
   26 degreesC on the growth, survival, gonad development and spawning
   rates of Procambarus ilamasi during a 90-day trial. Juveniles (<40 mm
   total length) were stocked at 76 org /m(2) density, and at a 1:1 M/F
   ratio. Growth improved in all treatments with increasing temperature,
   showing significant differences between sexes. Males grew more than
   females and achieved larger sizes with statistical differences (p<0.05)
   between treatments. Survival rate exhibited a negative relationship to
   temperature, with significant differences (p<0.05) between the 16
   degreesC treatment and the others, but not between the 21 and 26
   degreesC. Survival rate decreased from 90\% at 16 degreesC to 42\% at 26
   degreesC. Ovary development increased as temperature increased. The
   gonadosomatic and maturation indexes were significantly different
   (p<0.05) between the 16 degreesC treatment and the others, but not
   between the 21 and 26 degreesC treatments. Spawning rate exhibited no
   relationship to temperature, with optimum results (22\%) at 21 degreesC.

Abstract = {Juveniles of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei were kept Without
   food for between 0 to 15 clays to evaluate the impact of starvation oil
   physiologic state (oxygen consumption, poststarvation refeeding, index,
   nitrogen excretion, and O:N ratio) and digestive enzymes activity.
   Physiologic changes were found after 6 days of fasting, and refeeding
   ability declined as a result. Nevertheless. the shrimp were able to
   Survive 16 days Without food. Starvation Caused metabolism to drop
   progressively toward a basal level (21 J (.) h(-1 .) g(-1)) and a
   decrease in the rate of ammonia excretion, because of the catabolism of
   amino acids front soluble protein in the hepatopancreas. This decrease
   led to an increase in digestive enzymes specific activity (U/mg
   protein). But, expressed as total U. all digestive enzyme activities
   decreased in the absence of substrate from 0.016 to 0.007
   U/hepatopancreas (HP) for alpha-amylase and 2.58 to 0.63 U/HP for total
   trypsin. L. vannamei juveniles showed a true physiologic adaptation
   mechanism to food depiivation: no changes in body weight but loss in
   hepatosomatic index, no exuviations, including the utilization of HP
   soluble proteins (a drop from 269 to 53 mg/mL). After 10 days. a
   neoglycogenic pathway and the corresponding tissue enzymes activities
   seemed enhanced, and the animals derived all energetic Substrates mainly
   from protein (O:N ratio of 17) to cover their metabolic costs. Estimates
   of basal metabolism (Hem) from the routine respiration rate per clay
   (from 361 to 725 J (.) g ww(-1) (.) day(-1) through the 15-day
   starvation period). and loss of nonfecal energy (HxE) from the nitrogen
   excretion rate (varying from 39 to 57 J (.) g ww(-1) (.) day(-1) during
   the same period) were used in a bioenergetic partition model of a
   fasting juvenile. Which indicated that the energetic requirement to
   Survive Without feeding was in the range of 418 and 771 J (.) g ww(-1)
   (.) day(-1) during the 15-day period of starvation.},

Abstract = {The circadian rhythms of crayfish are entrained by blue light, through
   putative extra retinal photoreceptors. We investigated the presence and
   daily variation of CRY, a protein photosensitive to blue light spectra
   and ubiquitous in animals and plants, in the putative pacemakers of
   Procambarus clarkii, namely the eyestalk and brain, at different times
   of the 24 h light:dark cycles. Using different experimental light
   protocols and by means of qualitative/quantitative immunofluorescence
   anatomical and biochemical methods, we identified CRY inummoreactivity
   in cells located in the medullaterminalis-hemiellipsoidal complex
   (MT-HB) and the anterior margin of the median protocerebrum (PR). The
   immunoreaction varied with the time of day and the two neural structures
   showed a semi-mirror image. The results of the biochemical analysis
   matched these variations. Western blotting demonstrated statistically
   significant circadian rhythms in brain CRY abundance, but no daily
   circadian CRY abundance oscillations in the eyestalk. These
   immunocytochemical and biochemical results link a specific photoreceptor
   molecule to circadian rhythmicity. We propose that CRY may be linked to
   the photoreception of the clock and to the generation of circadian
   rhythmicity.},

Abstract = {In this research, we determined: 1) the insect guilds visiting the
   flower heads of five Asteraceae species (Eupatorium petiolare Mocino ex
   De Candolle, Senecio praecox {[}Cavanilles] De Candolle, Dahlia coccinea
   Cavanilles, Tagetes lunulata Ortega, and Verbesina virgata Cavanilles);
   2) the role of floral phenology and floral morphology on species
   composition and frequency of visits of different insect order; and 3)
   the diurnal schedules of anthophilous visitors and their relationship to
   temperature and relative humidity. Collections and observations of
   floral visitors for each species were made over 24 h per day. The five
   Asteraceae were visited by 137 Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and
   Lepidoptera species. Tagetes lunulata had the highest species richness
   of floral visitors (41 species), while V. virgata had the lowest (23
   species). Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera) was the only visitor found
   visiting all five species. Species composition of insect visitors was
   closely related to plant phenology. Order-level frequency of visits was
   closely related to floral morphology. Two separate principal component
   analyses based on frequency of visits and floral morphology showed
   similar plant species groupings. Two groups of insects (Formicidae and
   Coleoptera) and two floral traits (ligulae length and presence of a
   cylindrical-campanulate involucre), respectively, were the variables
   determining these groupings. The highest frequency of anthophilous
   visitors coincided with the highest temperatures and the lowest relative
   humidity levels on flowers of all species, except S. praecox. The
   combination of diurnal activity and guild visitor analyses in this study
   showed the importance of including both characteristics in pollination
   studies.},

Abstract = {Captive male Neotomodon alstoni exhibit paternal care. We tested whether

   maintained in the nest until weaning of the young, and in another 10
   pairs the male was removed shortly after birth of young. The presence of
   the male had a negative impact on the time spent by females in huddling
   with nursing young. In the presence of the male, females groomed and
   sniffed young less frequently than did females rearing young in the
   absence of the male. Survival of offspring (84\%) and their growth (20.6
   +/- 4.7 g) was significantly higher when both parents reared their
   young. Males provide additional care of young, allowing a higher quality
   of care by the female during rearing.},

   manifolds of codimension 2. Moreover, in the case of a surface M in R-N,

   field with respect to which M is umbilic and provide a geometrical

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The literature on populism used to depict the phenomenon as an
   alternative to the standard path from traditional to modern society; as
   a way to enfranchise the underclass; or as an anomaly vis-a-vis class
   politics and liberal institutions. More recently, the debate has shifted
   into something of a terra incognita as a result of the growing interest
   in the connection between populism and democratic politics. One of the
   more intriguing contributions to this debate is an article by Margaret
   Canovan, if only because it makes this unknown territory less confusing.
   Her argument draws from Michael Oakeshott's claim that political
   modernity is characterised by the interplay of two distinct styles - the
   politics of faith and the politics of scepticism. She renames them the
   redemptive and pragmatic faces of democracy and suggests that populism
   arises in the gap between them. This establishes a relation of
   interiority between populism and democracy. The former will follow
   democracy like a shadow. At times, however, the theoretical status of
   the gap is somewhat uncertain, as it seems more appropriate for thinking
   politics (particularly radical politics) in general. The political
   valence of the shadow could also be specified further to show the
   undecidability between the democratic aspect of the phenomenon and its
   possible ominous tones. This paper looks into this in some detail to
   engage in a friendly interrogation of Canovan's claims.},

Abstract = {Thermoacoustic equations are derived to describe the sound pressure
   radiation by a heated plane over a material substrate. By determining
   the velocity of an equivalent piston, the sound pressure emitted by a
   thermoacoustic source of finite dimensions can be calculated at any
   frequency. The measured sound pressures, obtained with devices
   constructed ad hoc for the experiments, are in good agreement with the
   theoretical expectations in the audio and ultrasound region, from 500 Hz
   to at least 100 kHz. The main results show that it is possible to
   produce significant sound pressure radiation in this frequency bandwidth
   with very simple devices, constructed with common materials. A potential
   feature for the kind of sound source described in this paper is that
   their radiating surfaces can have a desired shape, not only a plane one.},

Abstract = {Monthly volumes of capture of Lutjanus peru and Lutjanus guttatus from

   cycles. Time-series, auto correlation, and cross-correlation analysis
   showed that monthly abundance of populations display unsystematic
   variations. The FiSAT software was used to obtain the recruitment
   patterns of both species, using length-frequency data. Our results
   support the hypothesis that temporal phase-shifts in reproductive
   events, hence recruitment, explain the coexistence of these species. The
   outcome of this mechanism is a temporal succession of specific recruit
   abundance off the coasts of Guerrero, Mexico. The uncoupling of the
   recruitment events between these species, induces a separation of
   recruits: therefore, the intake of a particular set of preys could take
   place at different times.},
