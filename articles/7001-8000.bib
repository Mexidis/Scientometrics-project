Abstract = {In order to increase our embryological knowledge of Pereskia, a genus
   considered the earliest member of Cactaceae, we followed the development
   of the flowers and seeds of Pereskia lychnidiflora, a species from
   southeastern Mexico. We compared our data with that available from other
   closely related members in the family. The embryological
   characterization showed that basic features are homogeneous across the
   family and supported the placement of P. lychnidiflora as a member of
   one of two Pereskia clades, the one sister to remaining cacti. Our data
   also supports the hypothesis that within the family Cactaceae, the
   evolutionary tendency is towards a reduction of the perisperm. A
   multilayered seed coat was observed in P. lychnidiflora. A novel finding
   was the presence of stomata along the basal and central part of the
   ovary, a character that has never been reported before in other members
   of Pereskia.},

Abstract = {Hybridization can either reinforce or erode species boundaries;
   therefore, hybrid zones offer a natural experimental setting in which to
   assess the dynamics of reproductive isolation. Secondary contact zones,
   in particular, present a partial separation of the original divergence
   mechanisms and the subsequent genomic architecture of reproductive
   isolation (or lack thereof). The spatial context of secondary contact
   and its consequent effect on dispersal play vital roles on the contact's
   outcome. In a hybrid complex between two towhee species in Mexico,
   Pipilo maculatus and Pipilo ocai, two major hybrid gradients provide
   natural replicates for comparison. However, genetic analyses demonstrate
   significant divergence between geographically separate parental
   populations of each species and divergence of populations within each
   hybrid zone. The two hybrid transects (Teziutlan and Transvolcanic) are
   distinct and evidence suggests allelic introgression both across the
   species boundary and between the two transects. Habitat corridors for
   dispersal represent functional connectivity hotspots where the two
   transects meet. Both habitat connectivity and genetic differentiation
   between geographically disparate parental populations appear to
   influence the dynamics of gene flow across the hybrid gradients. In
   southern sympatric populations (Mt. Orizaba and Oaxaca) where
   morphological evidence for hybridization is scarce, opposing species'
   alleles appear to traverse through the hybrid zones rather than arising
   from cryptic local hybridization. These results illustrate the
   importance of environmentally mediated gene flow in the context of
   secondary contact as an important force influencing evolutionary
   trajectory.},

Abstract = {The Mexican state of Guerrero is fourth in butterfly diversity in
   Mexico. However, little is known about the superfamily Hesperioidea and
   communities of butterflies that live in coastal ecosystems. Hesperioidea
   and Papilionoidea of Laguna Potosi and surrounding area were surveyed
   monthly for 1 year (December 2009-November 2010) in pre-established
   transects in tropical dry forest; xerophytic shrubland; mangrove;
   coconut palm crop; secondary vegetation of tropical dry forest; and
   mixed environment of acacia forest, coconut palm, and mango crops. In
   total, 188 species in two superfamilies, six families, 18 subfamilies,
   and 127 genera were identified; seven species were endemic to Mexico,
   three to the tropical dry forest, and 32 were new records for Guerrero.
   Most species of butterflies were found in the family Hesperiidae (73),
   followed by Nymphalidae (52), Pieridae (20), Lycaenidae (19), Riodinidae
   (15), and Papilionidae (nine species). Most species were found in
   xerophytic shrubland (114) and tropical dry forest (103) that also had
   the greatest number of species exclusive to one habitat. Environmental
   heterogeneity increased the butterfly diversity of the area, including
   human-altered environments. Tropical dry forest and xerophytic shrubland
   seemed the vegetation types where butterfly diversity was greatest in
   the region. Preserving biological diversity, which is affected by both
   urbanization and the possibility of developing megaprojects for tourism,
   is necessary.},

Title = {HOW COMMON IS SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY ACROSS SPECIES OF THE HERKOGAMOUS
   GENUS ARIOCARPUS?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {101},
Number = {3},
Pages = {530-538},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Premise of the study: Self-incompatibility (SI), the most effective
   mechanism to prevent selfing, may limit the number of compatible mates
   in populations. The seven species of Ariocarpus are endangered and
   predominantly outcrossers but fruit set may reach 1-20\% after selfing.
   We aimed to determine whether SI is the underlying mechanism influencing
   mating in Ariocarpus species.
   Methods: We characterized the presence/absence of SI using pollination
   treatments (self-pollination, cross-pollination, natural pollination) in
   one population per species. We assessed SI using epifluorescence and
   generalized linear models (GLMs) to compare the presence of pollen tubes
   in the stigma, stylar transmitting tissue, and ovary among self-and
   cross-pollinated pistils 48 h after pollination. Following the same
   treatments, production of fruit set was noted and related to pollen tube
   growth.
   Key results: Pollen tubes were found more frequently in the ovaries of
   natural and cross-pollinated flowers than in ovaries of self-pollinated.
   Stylar rejection of self-pollen indicated gametophytic SI, although
   pollen tubes reached the ovaries in six species (4-33\% of pistils).
   Fruit set was lower after hand-pollinations than expected from pollen
   tube observations.
   Conclusions: The low percentages of self-compatibility in all species in
   pollen tube growth and pollination experiments indicated that no species
   had complete self-sterility, suggesting the presence of partial SI.
   Reduced fruit set relative to pollen tube production could result from a
   threshold of insufficient pollination, early-acting inbreeding
   depression, or resource limitation. The origin of partial SI in
   Ariocarpus could respond to pressures such as pollen limitation and
   population size.},

Abstract = {Mawsoniidae are a fossil family of actinistian fish popularly known as
   coelacanths, which are found in continental and marine
   paleoenvironments. The taxon is considered monophyletic, including five
   valid genera (Axelrodichthys, Chinlea, Diplurus, Mawsonia and
   Parnaibaia) and 11 genera with some taxonomical controversy (Alcoveria,
   Changxingia, Garnbergia, Heptanema, Indocoelacanthus, Libys, Lualabaea,
   Megalocoelacanthus, Moenkopia, Rhipis and Trachymetopon). The genera
   restricted to the Northern Hemisphere (Diplurus and Chinlea) possess the
   oldest records (Late Triassic), whereas those found in the Southern
   Hemisphere (Mawsonia, Axelrodichthys, and Parnaibaia) extend from Late
   Jurassic to Late Cretaceous, especially in Brazil and Africa. We
   identified distributional patterns of Mawsoniidae, applying the
   panbiogeographical method of track analysis, and obtained three
   generalized tracks (GTs): GT1 ( Northeastern Newark) in strata of the
   Newark Group (Upper Triassic); GT2 ( Midwestern Gondwana) in the Lualaba
   Formation (Upper Jurassic); and GT3 (Itapecuru-Alcantara-Santana) in the
   Itapecuru-AlcntaraSantana formations (Lower Cretaceous). The origin of
   Mawsoniidae can be dated to at least Late Triassic of Pangaea. The
   tectonic events related to the breakup of Pangaea and Gondwana and the
   evolution of the oceans are suggested as the vicariant events modeling
   the distribution of this taxon throughout the Mesozoic.},

Abstract = {The global effort to digitize biodiversity occurrence data from
   collections, museums and other institutions has stimulated the
   development of important tools to improve the knowledge and conservation
   of biodiversity. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
   enables and opens access to biodiversity data of 321 million of records,
   from 379 host institutions. Neotropical bats are a highly diverse and
   specialized group, and the geographic information about them is
   increasing since few years ago, but there are a few reports about this
   topic. The aim of this study was to analyze the number of digital
   records in GBIF of Neotropical bats with distribution in 21 American
   countries, evaluating their nomenclatural and geographical consistence
   at scale of country. Moreover, we evaluated the gaps of information on 1
   degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude grids cells. There were over 1/2
   million records, but 58\% of them have no latitude and longitude data;
   and 52\% full fit nomenclatural and geographic evaluation. We estimated
   that there are no records in 54\% of the analyzed area; the principal
   gaps are in biodiversity hotspots like the Colombian and Brazilian
   Amazonia and Southern Venezuela. In conclusion, our study suggests that
   available data on GBIF have nomenclatural and geographic biases. GBIF
   data represent partially the bat species richness and the main gaps in
   information are in South America.},

Title = {Incidence, severity, and aggregation patterns of two sympatric dwarf
   mistletoe species (Arceuthobium spp.) in Central Mexico},

Abstract = {Dwarf mistletoes are widely studied because of their significant impact
   on host populations; however, few studies have focused on sympatric
   species. The understanding of their coexistence is important because it
   can provide useful knowledge for future management plans. We
   investigated the incidence, severity, and aggregation patterns of
   Arceuthobium vaginatum and A. globosum coexisting in Central Mexico. We
   estimated the correlation between both species incidences (N = 75
   plots), the incidence-severity correlation (N = 47 plots) for each
   species, and the effect of biotic (host and non-host species abundance)
   and abiotic (altitude and slope) factors on the mistletoe incidence. In
   addition, we compared the hierarchical aggregation among and within
   plots of the two mistletoe species with a chi (2) test. There is a clear
   dominance of A. vaginatum in the area, and both species incidences are
   negatively correlated with each other (r (s) = - 0.54, P < 0.05) and
   host abundance (r = - 0.26, P < 0.05). The remaining factors were
   non-significant. Both species have a linear relationship between
   incidence and severity, i.e., they show a uniform increase in severity
   with incidence, which could help diagnose the degree of tree infection
   from incidence measurements. The species are aggregated within plots,
   but only A. globosum shows an aggregation among plots (chi (2) = 82.25,
   P < 0.001); aggregation has not been shown previously for two sympatric
   dwarf mistletoe species. Our results can improve the scientific basis
   for forest management planning to control dwarf mistletoe and maintain
   biodiversity.},

Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Main injective modules, which determine every left exact preradical,
   were introduced in a former work. In this paper, we consider those
   modules which determine every preradical and we call them main modules.
   We prove that a main module exists if and only if the lattice of
   preradicals R-pr is a set, and in this case we give a general
   construction. Some properties of main modules are proven. We also prove
   some characterizations of rings for which (a) every preradical is left
   exact, (b) every preradical is idempotent, (c) every preradical is a
   radical, (d) every preradical is a t-radical, (e) every preradical which
   is not the identity functor is prime. These characterizations relate to
   semisimple artinian rings, rings that are a direct product of a finite
   number of simple rings, left V-rings, simple rings, among others. In
   order to illustrate the theory introduced in this paper, several
   examples are provided.},

Title = {Encapsulation of sodium radio-iodide in fullerene C60},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this work we have studied the well-known ``Buckminsterfullerene{''}
   C-60 containing different amounts, from one to four molecules, of sodium
   radio-iodide ((NaI)-I-131), with density functional theory geometrical
   optimizations and molecular dynamics at 310 K and atmospheric pressure.
   We found that nanocapsules with the radioactive content
   (NaI)-I-131@C-60, 2Na(131)I@C-60 and 3Na(131)I@C-60 are stable.
   Furthermore, the C-60 fullerene undergoes expansion when the number of
   sodium radio-iodide molecules inside increases. Utilizing the Mulliken
   charge distribution analysis it was shown that a small charge transfer
   occurs from iodine to fullerene's carbon atoms. This produces repulsion
   which increases bond lengths thus the structure is weakened while the
   binding energy per atom decreases. For the case in which the fullerene
   initially contains four sodium radio-iodide molecules the expansion is
   greater than that which the structure can withstand. So the fullerene
   breaks and releases its contents. This result leads us to conclude that
   the fullerene can encapsulate up to three molecules of sodium
   radio-iodide.},

Abstract = {Survival during first months after birth is one of the bottlenecks for
   consolidating the seahorse farming industry. In this work, Artemia
   metanauplii enriched with two highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) rich
   commercial emulsions with different docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels
   (63\% and 14\% of total lipids), a vegetable oil with no DHA, and
   non-enriched Artemia as control, were used to feed 5-day-old juvenile
   Hippocampus erectus for 60 days. Enriched Artemia had similar levels of
   DHA (13\% and 9\%), despite great differences of DHA in the emulsions,
   with traces of DHA in non-enriched and vegetable oil enriched Artemia.
   More than 20\% of DHA was found in 24 h starved juveniles fed both
   DHA-enriched treatments, similar to values in newly born juveniles, but
   those fed vegetable oil enriched Artemia or non-enriched Artemia had 5\%
   of DHA. Total lipid and protein levels were similar in juveniles from
   the four treatments. The n-3/n-6 ratio was almost four-fold higher in
   seahorses fed DHA-enriched treatments compared to juveniles fed the
   non-enriched treatments. Survival of seahorses only partially reflected
   the DHA levels: it was lower in the vegetable oil treatment, similar in
   the seahorses fed Artemia with higher DHA and in the control treatment,
   and higher in seahorses fed the HUFA-enriched Artemia with lower DHA
   levels, although growth was similar in the two DHA-enriched Artemia
   treatments. Juvenile H. erectus seahorses perform better when they have
   at least 20\% of DHA in their tissues, and these levels can be attained
   with no more than 14\% of DHA in emulsions, eliminating the need for

Abstract = {For a locally compact group G we consider the class G-M of all proper
   (in the sense of R. Palais) G-spaces that are metrizable by a
   G-invariant metric. We show that each X is an element of G-M admits a
   compatible G-invariant metric whose closed unit balls are small subsets
   of X. This is a key result to prove that X admits a closed equivariant
   embedding into an invariant convex subset V of a Banach G-space L such
   that L\textbackslash{}\{0\} E is an element of G-M and V is a G-absolute
   extensor for the class G-M. On this way we establish two equivariant
   embedding results for proper G-spaces which may be considered as
   equivariant versions of the well-known Kuratowski-Wojdyslawski theorem
   and Arens-Eells theorem, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of Entamoeba species

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Veterinary medicine has focused recently on reptiles, due to the
   existence of captive collections in zoos and an increase in the
   acquisition of reptiles as pets. The protozoan parasite, Entamoeba can
   cause amoebiasis in various animal species and humans. Although
   amoebiasis disease is remarkably rare in most species of chelonians and
   crocodiles, these species may serve as Entamoeba species carriers that
   transmit parasites to susceptible reptile species, such as snakes and
   lizards, which can become sick and die. In this study, we identified the
   Entamoeba species in a population of healthy (disease-free) chelonians,
   and evaluated their diversity through the amplification and sequencing
   of a small subunit rDNA region. Using this procedure, three Entamoeba
   species were identified: Entamoeba invadens in 4.76 \% of chelonians,
   Entamoeba moshkovskii in 3.96 \% and Entamoeba terrapinae in 50\%. We
   did not detect mixed Entamoeba infections. Comparative analysis of the
   amplified region allowed us to determine the intra-species variations.
   The E. invadens and E. moshkovskii strains isolated in this study did
   not exhibit marked differences with respect to the sequences reported in
   GenBank. The analysis of the E. terrapinae isolates revealed three
   different subgroups (A, B and C). Although subgroups A and C were very
   similar, subgroup B showed a relatively marked difference with respect
   to subgroups A and C (F-st=0.984 and F-st=1.000, respectively; 10-14\%
   nucleotide variation, as determined by BLAST) and with respect to the
   sequences reported in GenBank. These results suggested that E.
   terrapinae subgroup B may be either in a process of speciation or belong
   to a different lineage. However, additional research is necessary to
   support this statement conclusively.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to compare the richness and endemism patterns
   of Mexican species of amphibians and reptiles at different spatial
   scales. We used the best available dataset of distributional ranges
   generated from ecological niche models and employed geographically
   weighted regressions (GWRs) to test whether richness and endemism were
   related. Patterns were found to vary with the scale used for richness
   and endemism, and these patterns were not coincident. The results showed
   that: (1) only relatively coarse spatial scales can address latitudinal
   patterns in amphibians and reptiles, and, in fine scales, they are
   related to topographic formations; (2) areas of greatest endemism for
   amphibians and reptiles are located in the highlands of the central or
   southern part of the country, although not necessarily in the same
   specific highlands for both groups; (3) there is a strong average
   correlation between richness and endemism for both groups, indicating
   that the same factors contribute to both patterns, but these factors act
   differentially in terms of regions among amphibians and reptiles; and
   (4) the scale at which the analysis is conducted is important, and we
   believe that careful consideration of spatial scale must be undertaken
   to avoid false conclusions.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London,

Title = {Aedes aegypti Mos20 Cells Internalizes Cry Toxins by Endocytosis,
   and Actin Has a Role in the Defense against Cry11Aa Toxin},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {464-487},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins are used to control Aedes
   aegypti, an important vector of dengue fever and yellow fever. Bt Cry
   toxin forms pores in the gut cells, provoking larvae death by osmotic
   shock. Little is known, however, about the endocytic and/or degradative
   cell processes that may counteract the toxin action at low doses. The
   purpose of this work is to describe the mechanisms of internalization
   and detoxification of Cry toxins, at low doses, into Mos20 cells from A.
   aegypti, following endocytotic and cytoskeletal markers or specific
   chemical inhibitors. Here, we show that both clathrin-dependent and
   clathrin-independent endocytosis are involved in the internalization
   into Mos20 cells of Cry11Aa, a toxin specific for Dipteran, and Cry1Ab,
   a toxin specific for Lepidoptera. Cry11Aa and Cry1Ab are not directed to
   secretory lysosomes. Instead, Mos20 cells use the Rab5 and Rab11
   pathways as a common mechanism, most probably for the expulsion of
   Cry11Aa and Cry1Ab toxins. In conclusion, we propose that endocytosis is
   a mechanism induced by Cry toxins independently of specificity, probably
   as part of a basal immune response. We found, however, that actin is
   necessary for defense-specific response to Cry11Aa, because
   actin-silenced Mos20 cells become more sensitive to the toxic action of
   Cry11A toxin. Cry toxin internalization analysis in insect cell lines
   may contribute to a better understanding to Cry resistance in
   mosquitoes.},

Abstract = {Advances in the classification of the human pathogen Histoplasma
   capsulatum (H. capsulatum) (ascomycete) are sustained by the results of
   several genetic analyses that support the high diversity of this
   dimorphic fungus. The present mini-review highlights the great genetic
   plasticity of H. capsulatum. Important records with different molecular
   tools, mainly single- or multi-locus sequence analyses developed with
   this fungus, are discussed.
   Recent phylogenetic data with a multi-locus sequence analysis using 5
   polymorphic loci support a new clade and/or phylogenetic species of H.
   capsulatum for the Americas, which was associated with fungal isolates
   obtained from the migratory bat Tadarida brasiliensis.

   conditions: Energy conversion and harvesting},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Hysteresis cycles are very important features of energy conversion and
   harvesting devices, such as batteries. The efficiency of these may be
   strongly affected by the physical size of the system. Here, we show that
   in systems which are small enough, the existence of physical boundaries
   which produce nonhomogeneities of the interaction potential gives rise
   to inflections and barriers in the associated free energy. This in turn
   brings on irreversible processes which can be triggered under suitable
   external conditions imposed by a heat bath. As an example, by
   controlling the temperature, the state of a small system may be impelled
   to oscillate between two different structural configurations or
   aggregation states avoiding equilibrium coexistence and therefore
   dissipating energy. This cyclical behavior associated with a hysteresis
   cycle may be prototypical of energy conversion, storage, or generating
   nanodevices, as exemplified by Li-ion insertion batteries.},

Abstract = {Structural and viscoelastic properties of slightly interconnected
   polymer networks immersed in a solvent have been studied in two cases:
   when the polymer network is building up and when the polymer network is
   shrinking stepwise in a controlled way. To accomplish this goal, the
   mean square displacement (MSD) of embedded microspheres in the polymer
   network was measured as a function of time, with diffusive wave
   spectroscopy. Particle motion was analyzed in terms of a model, based on
   a Fokker-Planck type equation, developed for describing particles in
   Brownian motion within a network that constrain their movement. The
   model reproduces well the experimental features observed in the MSD vs t
   curves. The variation of the parameters describing the structure of the
   network can be understood as the polymerization comes about, and also
   after the successive volume contractions. In addition, from the MSD
   curves, the complex shear moduli were obtained in a wide range of
   frequencies when the network is building up, and at the different
   shrinking states of the network. Our microrheological results give an
   insight about the dynamics of embedded particles in slightly
   interconnected networks, which were also compared with similar results
   for polymers without interconnections and polymer gels.},

Abstract = {We extend the analysis of arXiv : 1211.2199, where the photon production
   rate of an anisotropic strongly coupled plasma with Nf << N-c massless
   quarks was considered. We allow here for non-vanishing quark masses and
   study how these affect the spectral densities and conductivities. We
   also compute another important probe of the plasma, the dilepton
   production rate. We consider generic angles between the anisotropic
   direction and the photon and dilepton wave vectors, as well as arbitrary
   quark masses and arbitrary values of the anisotropy parameter.
   Generically, the anisotropy increases the production rate of both
   photons and dileptons, compared with an isotropic plasma at the same

Title = {Diminishing return for increased Mappability with longer sequencing
   reads: implications of the k-mer distributions in the human
   genome},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Background: The amount of non-unique sequence (non-singletons) in a
   genome directly affects the difficulty of read alignment to a reference
   assembly for high throughput-sequencing data. Although a longer read is
   more likely to be uniquely mapped to the reference genome, a
   quantitative analysis of the influence of read lengths on mappability
   has been lacking. To address this question, we evaluate the k-mer
   distribution of the human reference genome. The k-mer frequency is
   determined for k ranging from 20 bp to 1000 bp.
   Results: We observe that the proportion of non-singletons k-mers
   decreases slowly with increasing k, and can be fitted by piecewise
   power-law functions with different exponents at different ranges of k. A
   slower decay at greater values for k indicates more limited gains in
   mappability for read lengths between 200 bp and 1000 bp. The frequency
   distributions of k-mers exhibit long tails with a power-law-like trend,
   and rank frequency plots exhibit a concave curve. The most frequent
   1000-mers comprise 172 regions, which include four large stretches on
   chromosomes 1 X, containing genes of biomedical relevance. Comparison
   with other databases indicates that the 172 regions can be broadly
   classified into two types: those containing LINE transposable elements
   and those containing segmental duplications.
   Conclusion: Read mappability as measured by the proportion of singletons
   increases steadily up to the length scale around 200 bp. When read
   length increases above 200 bp, smaller gains in mappability are
   expected. Moreover, the proportion of non-singletons decreases with read
   lengths much slower than linear. Even a read length of 1000 bp would not
   allow the unique alignment of reads for many coding regions of human
   genes. A mix of techniques will needed for efficiently producing
   high-quality data that cover the complete human genome.},

Abstract = {The water mite Hydrachna guanajuatensis Cook, 1980 is recorded as an
   ectoparasite of Ranatra sp. (Nepidae), Notonecta sp., Buenoa sp.
   (Notonectidae), Krizousacorixa femorata (Guerin, 1857), Trichocorixella
   mexicana (Hungerford, 1927), and Hesperocorixa laevigata (Uhler, 1893)
   (Corixidae). The host body region, where the larvae and protonymph
   attach, depends significantly on the heteropteran species: chi(2) =
   3969.43, p < 0.05 and chi(2) = 1893.6, p < 0.05, respectively. We
   performed a cross tabulation with a correspondence analysis and found
   three associations for the larvae: 1) dorsal side of abdomen underneath
   the wings of the two species of Notonectidae, 2) head, wings, and hind
   legs of two of the species of Corixidae (T. mexicana and K. femorata),
   and 3) thorax and fore and middle legs of the single species of Nepidae.
   These different patterns are discussed according to morphological and
   ecological characteristics of the hosts. This is the first study that
   deals with the spatial distribution patterns within the same species of
   ectoparasite.},

Abstract = {The Craugastor rhodopis Species Group includes two leaf-litter frog
   species (C. loki and C. rhodopis). These direct-developing frogs inhabit
   tropical regions of Mexico and northern Central America. Characterizing
   diversity within the group has been difficult due to high levels of
   phenotypic polymorphism within and between species. Because of these
   polymorphisms, each taxon has junior synonyms. Using a fragment of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we investigated genetic diversity in the C.
   rhodopis Species Group. We then examined type specimens (including types
   of junior synonyms) to match nomenclature to geographically
   circumscribed genetic clusters. Our molecular analyses revealed four
   major lineages within the C. rhodopis Species Group: (1) a widely
   distributed clade in western Mexico, (2) a highland clade in eastern
   Mexico, (3) a widely distributed lowland clade occurring in eastern
   Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, and (4) a haplotype from Volcan San
   Martin in Veracruz, Mexico. We identified the first clade as C.
   occidentalis, a taxon currently placed in the ecologically similar but
   phylogenetically distant C. mexicanus Species Series. In light of this
   we place C. occidentalis in the C. rhodopis Species Group and designate
   a lectotype and paralectotype for the species. The second and third
   clades inhabiting eastern Mexico and northern Central America correspond
   to C. rhodopis and C. loki, respectively. Additionally, we examined the
   taxonomic distribution of certain colour pattern traits and compensatory
   mutations in Domain III of the mtDNA 12S ribosomal RNA gene. Our
   recovery of the divergent Veracruz haplotype and extensive mtDNA
   structure within species indicates that additional taxonomic revision
   will be necessary.},

Abstract = {The study area is an endorheic basin belonging to the La Cienega River,
   on the eastern flank of the Nevado de Toluca volcano (NTV), and extends
   from the edge of the crater to the plain of the Valley of Toluca. La
   Cienega River flows onto the Alto Lerma plain, where the basin is closed
   by the Tepetl or Tenango andesitic lava flows. The alluvial fan at the
   mouth of the La Cienega River is composed of ancient debris flows and
   lahar deposits. An urban settlement of 2500 inhabitants called Santa
   Cruz Pueblo Nuevo (2880 masl), municipality of Tenango del Valle, State
   of Mexico, is located here. On June 24, 1940, a torrential rain
   triggered a large debris flow that destroyed the locality. The town had
   to be rebuilt and was thus named Pueblo Nuevo (new town). In spite of
   this disaster, the town of Santa Cruz and the current Tenango-Ixtapan de
   la Sal highway are on the fan, thereby endangering the inhabitants and
   infrastructure. The NTV is a stratovolcano that has erupted at least
   eighteen times during the past 60000 years. Vulcanian, plinian and
   merapi type eruptions have left thick deposits of diverse pyroclastic
   materials. The geomorphologic survey shows that the basin has developed
   on a slope of pyroclastic material composed of block and ash flow
   deposits (with greyish and reddish dacitic lithics, of sizes ranging
   from 2.5 cm to 2.5 m in diameter), debris avalanche deposits, lahar
   deposits, surges, ash flows and pumice falls (fragments from 1 to 10 cm
   diameter), which are materials that are only slightly cohesive and
   easily eroded. At the river head a network of canyons between 50 and 150
   m deep has developed. The middle and lower parts of the basin have
   developed on the volcanic foothills, with ravines from 25 to 150 m
   depth, in which creep processes favor the development of shallow (< 2 m)
   and deep landslides (> 2 m). Rock falls into the valleys contribute to
   the formation of debris flows, and supply material for the alluvial fan
   formed at the mouth of the La Cienega River. A geomorphological survey
   and a preliminary landslide inventory was conducted, as part of the
   landslide study that was carried out in the basin of the La Cienega
   River. The geomorphological survey included five morphometric maps
   (hypsometric, internal relief, vertical dissection, slopes, and
   potential erosion); five transversal profiles over the course of the
   river, and geomorphologic and geologic maps.},

Title = {Multilocus analysis of intraspecific differentiation in three endemic
   bird species from the northern Neotropical dry forest},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {362-377},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Among-species phylogeographic concordance provides insight into the
   common processes driving lineage divergence in a particular region.
   However, identifying the processes that caused phylogeographic breaks is
   not always straight forward, and inferring past environmental conditions
   in combination with documented geologic events is sometimes necessary to
   explain current patterns. We searched for concordant phylogeographic
   patterns and investigated their causes in three bird species (Momotus
   mexicanus, Melanerpes cluysogenys, and Passerina leclancherii) that
   belong to three different avian orders and are endemic to the
   northernmost range of the Neotropical dry forest. We obtained
   mitochondrial DNA (ND2 and COI or cyt b) and nuclear DNA (20454, GAPDH,
   MUSK, and TGFB) sequences for at least one locus from 162 individuals
   across all species and defined climatically stable areas using
   environmental niche model projections for the last 130,000 years to have
   a paleoenvironmental framework for the phylogeographic results. All
   three species showed marked phylogeographic structure, with breaks found
   in roughly similar areas, such as the border between the Mexican states
   of Guerrero and Oaxaca, and between southern Jalisco and Michoacan. Both
   of these regions are known biogeographic breaks among other taxa.
   Patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation were partially
   compatible with climatically stable areas. Coalescent analyses revealed
   recent population growth and estimated the deeper haplogroup divergence
   of all three taxa to have occurred within the last 600,000 years. The
   phylogeographic patterns found are noteworthy because they are
   maintained in a relatively small area for bird species with continuous
   ranges, and highlight a unique situation when compared to
   phylogeographic patterns found in other studies of Neotropical birds
   that have stressed the role of geographic barriers to explain
   intraspecific differentiation. Our results point to a scenario of
   population isolation resulting in the present phylogeographic structure,
   likely a result of historical climate fluctuations that have fragmented
   and reconnected the Neotropical dry forest. This study contributes to a
   growing body of evidence indicating active diversification of endemic
   lineages in the northern Neotropical dry forest region. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Forty one new records of species of Bombyliidae are reported for
   Coahuila in northeastern Mexico. Nine of these species are reported for
   the first time for the country. The specimens were collected in the
   Cuatro Cienegas Basin and Sierra La Madera mountains during 2007-2013.
   The modified distributions of species are discussed. The gaps in the
   distribution of many species suggest an undersampling of this group of
   insects in the north of Mexico.},

Title = {Hypothalamic expression of anorexigenic and orexigenic hormone receptors

Abstract = {Obesity is a world problem that requires a better understanding of its
   physiological and genetic basis, as well as the mechanisms by which the
   hypothalamus controls feeding behavior. The volcano mouse Neotomodon
   alstoni develops obesity in captivity when fed with regular chow diet,
   providing a novel model for the study of obesity. Females develop
   obesity more often than males; therefore, in this study, we analysed in
   females, in proestrous lean and obese, the differences in hypothalamus
   expression of receptors for leptin, ghrelin (growth hormone secretagogue
   receptor GHS-R), and VPAC, and correlates for plasma levels of total
   ghrelin. The main comparisons are between mice fed ad libitum and mice
   after 24 hours of fasting. Mice above 65 g body weight were considered
   obese, based on behavioral and physiological parameters such as food
   intake, plasma free fatty acids, and glucose tolerance. Hypothalamic
   tissue from obese and lean mice was analysed by western blot. Our
   results indicate that after ad libitum food access, obese mice show no
   significant differences in hypothalamic leptin receptors, but a
   significant increase of 60\% in the GHS-R, and a nearly 62\% decrease in
   VPAC2 was noted. After a 24-hour fast, plasma ghrelin increased nearly
   two fold in both lean and obese mice; increases of hypothalamic leptin
   receptors and GHS-R were also noted, while VPAC2 did not change
   significantly; levels of plasma free fatty acids were 50\% less after
   fasting in obese than in lean animals. Our results indicate that in
   obese N. alstoni mice, the levels of orexigenic receptors in the
   hypothalamus correlate with overfeeding, and the fact that lean and
   obese females respond in different ways to a metabolic demand such as a
   24-hour fast.},

Title = {Noncovalent functionalization of graphene with a Ni(II) tetraaza{[}14]
   annulene complex},
Journal = {DALTON TRANSACTIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Number = {20},
Pages = {7413-7428},
Abstract = {The few-layer graphene, produced by exfoliation of graphite in
   4-methylanisole, was noncovalently functionalized with the Ni(II)
   complex of
   5,7,12,14-tetramethyldibenzo-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-3,5,7,10,12
   ,14-hexaene (Ni(II)-tetramethyldibenzotetraaza{[}14] annulene, or
   NiTMTAA), which is a simple model of more complex porphyrins and
   phthalocyanines. The resulting hybrid materials with different content
   of NiTMTAA were characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis,
   scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM,
   respectively), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray,
   Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy, as
   well as fluorescence and conductivity measurements. Additional
   information on the mechanisms of NiTMTAA interaction with graphene was
   obtained from density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics
   (MM) calculations. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest
   that NiTMTAA forms a full double-sided adsorption layer on the graphene
   surface. The presence of NiTMTAA molecules in the hybrid materials
   obtained manifests itself in the appearance of characteristic bands in
   all types of electromagnetic spectra recorded; in FTIR, they are
   relatively weak as compared to graphene absorption bands, but dominate
   in Raman spectra. The morphology of the nanohybrids observed by SEM, TEM
   and AFM, as well as their electrical conductivity, depends on the
   NiTMTAA content. According to the results of DFT calculations of NiTMTAA
   adsorption on different graphene models, flat orientation of the complex
   with respect to graphene is energetically preferable, with a little
   difference depending on whether benzo or methyl groups contact the
   sheet.},

   designed at Fermilab. Developed specifically for the measurement of
   charge from photo-detectors in high-rate environments, this most recent
   addition to the QIE family features 3 fC sensitivity, 17-bits of dynamic
   range with logarithmic response, a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) with
   sub-nanosecond resolution, and internal charge injection. The device is
   capable of dead-timeless operation at 40 MHz, making it ideal for
   calorimetry at the Large hadron Collider (LHC). We present bench
   measurements and integration studies that characterize the performance,
   radiation tolerance measurements, and plans for deployment in the Atlas
   and CMS detectors as part of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 upgrades.},

   Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder, and temporal lobe epilepsy
   represents an estimated 40\% of all epilepsy cases. Currently, evidence
   from human and experimental models supports the involvement of oxidative
   stress during seizures and in the epileptogenesis process. Hence, the

Abstract = {Despite some studies of the species groups within the genus Peromyscus
   have been performed, both evolutionary relationships among species
   within groups and group composition have remained controversial. In this
   study, we address phylogenetic relationships among species in the
   Peromyscus melanophrys group (P. melanophrys, P. perfulvus, and P.
   mekisturus), using a molecular phylogenetic analysis. This analysis is
   the first to include the poorly known P. mekisturus. We conducted
   maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses with the ND3,
   tRNA-Arginine, ND4L, and partial ND4 mitochondrial genes, and the GHR
   nuclear gene. We consistently recovered a P. melanophrys group that is
   monophyletic with respect to the set of outgroups. Also, we recovered
   two distinct clades within P. perfulvus and two within P. melanophrys,
   one of which contain P. mekisturus among other P. melanophrys, all with
   geographic consistency. According to our divergence time estimates, the
   P. melanophrys group diverged during the Pliocene and the main
   diversification events within the group occurred at the end of the
   Pliocene and through the Pleistocene. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The curation of biological digital data or biocuration is the activity
   of organizing, representing and making biological information accessible
   to human beings through computers. Among its tasks are the organization,
   standardization, normalization, classification, annotation and analysis
   of information. The National System of Information on Biodiversity
   (SNIB) from the National Commission for Knowledge and Use of
   Biodiversity (CONABIO) integrates information of about six million
   records of biological organisms and observations mainly from zoological
   collections and herbaria in Mexico. To manage this information CONABIO
   has established quality control mechanisms of the data that are included
   in the SNIB, that allows to integrate the information of different
   sources and make it consistent and interoperable with other information
   systems. This work has the purpose of exposing the importance of
   biocuration of biodiversity databases, explaining the curating process
   carried out in Biotica (c), which is CONABIO's Information System,
   exemplifying some of the most common errors that occur in biological
   data such as: omission, typographical, contextual, redundancy,
   convention, uniformity and consistency, presenting some solutions, and
   discussing the importance of research and teaching of biocuration for
   biologists of 21st century.},

Abstract = {Mecoptera are small holometabolous insects with elongate and slender
   bodies, superficially resembling primitive true flies. They posses a
   characteristic head and mouthparts structure pronounced to form a
   rostrum. They are commonly called scorpionflies, because in Panorpidae
   males the terminal part of the abdomen bears genital structures
   resembling a hook or scorpion sting. Their active season is brief
   through the year. Although distributed worldwide, especially in humid
   temperate and subtropical climates, they are only moderately to scarcely
   represented in scientific collections. The order comprises about 600
   species in 9 families worldwide. In Mexico, 47 species have been
   recorded. They are comprised mainly in the genera Panorpa (32 species)
   and Bittacus (9 species) with a widespread distribution, with the rest
   of species in Kalobittacus, Eremobittacus and Hylobittacus. A brief
   account of their life cycle and distribution in Mexico are included.},

Journal = {BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA},

Volume = {66},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Fossil assemblages reflect the parental communities that produced them,
   and are in turn associated with specific environmental conditions. Thus,
   climatic and environmental changes are associated with changes in both
   the biotic communities and the fossil assemblages they produce. As a
   consequence, the environmental reconstruction of the past relies on the
   interpretation of multivariate fossil sequences that are commonly
   analyzed through dimensional rescaling techniques. Detrended
   correspondence analysis (DCA) has proven as an excellent technique to
   summarize ecological changes through time with the advantage of few
   prior assumptions and results that can be directly interpreted in terms
   of ecological turnover. In this paper we elaborate on a brief
   description of the technique and the interpretation of results, using a
   worked example on pollen and diatom data sets from Lago Verde (Los
   Tuxtlas, Mexico). With this worked example, we highlight the three basic
   ways in which DCA can provide useful approaches for a clear and
   relatively easy interpretation of the fossil data: i) identification of
   the ecological space through the a priori interpretation of species
   ordination; ii) localization of time slices within the ecological space
   defined by species, and quantification of the ecological turnover among
   samples; and iii) calculation of ecological distances as a means for
   putting individual samples into the historical context provided by the
   time frame in question.},

Abstract = {Ferns are an ancient and diverse lineage of vascular plants that differ
   morphologically, chemically and in growth habits from the angiosperms
   with which they co-occur. We used a culture-based approach coupled with
   phylogenetic analyses to characterize the incidence, diversity and
   composition of fungal endophyte assemblages in ferns, with a focus on
   healthy aboveground tissues of seven species of eupolypods at La Selva,
   Costa Rica. Endophytes were isolated from every individual plant and
   were similarly abundant and diverse in frond blades and stalks, in
   different vegetation types, in epiphytic vs. terrestrial species, and
   between sampling years. However, abundance, diversity and community
   structure differed significantly among fern species, and composition
   differed markedly between sampling years. Phylogenetic classification
   using separate and combined datasets revealed that as for many
   Neotropical angiosperms, the majority (95\%) of endophyte taxa were
   Ascomycota, with particular dominance by Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes
   and Dothideomycetes. However, our data suggest higher phylogenetic
   richness and stronger host affinities in fern associated endophytes
   relative to those studied in angiosperms thus far.},

Abstract = {We summarize the information on the phytoplankton of the Parana River in
   the Argentine stretch, comparing the density, biomass, functional groups
   and diversity studies of the mainstem and floodplain since the 70's. We
   described the Yacyreta Reservoir and its impact downriver since it
   started operating in 1994. The spatio-temporal changes of the
   phytoplankton are associated to the hydrosedimentological regime.
   Regular variations in the hydrological phases and shorter permanent
   fluctuations are essential for phytoplankton maintenance, since they
   allow the lateral exchange with zones of higher algal accumulation in
   the main channel and with the floodplain. During ordinary hydrological
   cycles, the mainstem shows a typical potamoplankton, dominated by
   Aulacoseira granulata and, alternatively, with sub-dominance of
   Chlorococcales, Cryptophyceae at the Middle and Lower Stretch,
   Cyanobacteria abound at Yacyreta Reservoir and downriver at the High and
   the beginning of the Middle Stretch. The disruption of Yacyreta
   Reservoir produces profound changes in the High Parana phytoplankton
   evidenced in increased density and replacement of dominant species;
   Cryptophyceae replaced the Bacillariophyceae. Since 2001, water
   transparency increased and phosphorus concentration decreased, as well
   as the density and diversity of phytoplankton. Since 2004, an increase
   in Cyanobacteria was observed with bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa that
   extended 220 km downstream of the dam. Anomalous hydrological cycles,
   related to the ENSO phenomenon produced changes in phytoplankton density
   and structure. During El Nino, the system maintains a relative
   homogeneous phytoplankton assemblage, although mean density values are
   significantly lower than those registered in ordinary hydrological
   periods. La Nina provokes a more drastic change in the community, due to
   the disruption in the exchange with the alluvial valley. The
   river-floodplain connectivity is essential for the maintenance of
   phytoplankton diversity.},

   October, 2013. Including 159 genera and 40 families; representing 8.7\%
   of the reptiles of the world. Of the 864 species, 417 are lizards, 393
   snakes, 48 turtles, 3 amphisbaenians and 3 crocodiles. There are 493
   endemic species recorded for the country. The states with a greater
   number of species are: Oaxaca (262), Chiapas (220) and Veracruz (200),
   while states with a less diverse reptile fauna are: Tlaxcala (36
   species), Distrito Federal (39) and Guanajuato (43).},

Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Progesterone (P-4) promotes cell proliferation in several types of
   cancer, including brain tumors such as astrocytomas, the most common and
   aggressive primary intracerebral neoplasm in humans. In this work, we
   studied the effects of P-4 and its intracellular receptor antagonist,
   RU486, on growth and infiltration of U373 cells derived from a human
   astrocytoma grade III, implanted in the motor cortex of adult male rats,
   using two treatment schemes. In the first one, fifteen days after cells
   implantation, rats were daily subcutaneously treated with vehicle
   (propylene glycol, 160 mu L), P-4 (1mg), RU486 (5mg), or P-4 + RU486 (1
   mg and 5 mg, resp.) for 21 days. In the second one, treatments started 8
   weeks after cells implantation and lasted for 14 days. In both schemes
   we found that P-4 significantly increased the tumor area as compared
   with the rest of the treatments, whereas RU486 blocked P-4 effects. All
   rats treated with P-4 showed tumor infiltration, while 28.6\% and 42.9\%
   of the animals treated with RU486 and P-4 + RU486, respectively,
   presented it. Our data suggest that P-4 promotes growth and migration of
   human astrocytoma cells implanted in the motor cortex of the rat through
   the interaction with its intracellular receptor.},

Abstract = {Recurrence quantitative analysis (RQA) indexes of beat-to-beat
   heart-beat interval and systolic blood pressure (SBP) have helped to
   understand the dynamical response to active standing. The peripheral
   blood volume is another variable of the cardiovascular control system
   with a crucial role during active standing since re-distribution of
   blood volume is necessary to counteract the gravity force and to provide
   enough blood supply to vital organs. Beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic
   systolic blood volume (SBV) oscillations may be useful to study the
   cardiovascular control if it is considered as a regulatory system with
   relevant local differences compared to blood pressure regulation. There
   are no previous reports of the SBV dynamical response to active
   standing. In this work we study simultaneously the dynamical response of
   heart-beat interval, SBP and SBV to active standing through comparison
   of RQA indexes evaluated during supine position and during active
   standing in 19 healthy volunteers. We show that in response to
   orthostatic stress, SBV oscillations have dynamic changes similar, but
   not identical, to SBP and the heart-beat interval. This suggests that
   these three variables are complementary for a better evaluation of the
   cardiovascular dynamics.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The sun compass orientation implies a circadian clock and the sun's
   azimuth in order to establish a direction. This behavior has been
   observed in a diversity of invertebrate and vertebrate species including
   reptiles. Shifting an organism's internal clock by a given period of
   time (via alterations in photoperiod) helps to demonstrate the presence
   of a sun compass and circadian clock mechanisms. This study aims to test
   whether a sun compass orientation mechanism exists in hatchlings of the
   hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata at the shore of Sisal, Yucatan,
   Mexico. In order to mask the magnetic sensitivity, turtles were observed
   with and without a neodymium magnet attached to their carapaces. One
   group of animals was held in regular LD, while another group was
   maintained for three days in a 6-h-delayed LD. Observations were made by
   photographs in an open circular arena near the shore. Results obtained
   from these observations indicate that hatchlings exposed to a
   6-h-delayed LD show a difference in angular direction of near 60 degrees
   and that magnets do not change such difference. Swimming activity
   recorded during the first four days after hatching indicates an
   organized crepuscular rhythm. The implications of multiple orientation
   mechanisms in these species and conservation efforts are discussed.},

Title = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in changing environments: The
   effects of seasonality and anthropogenic disturbance in a seasonal dry
   forest},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {87-95},
Abstract = {The landscape of Mexican seasonal dry forests is affected by various
   periodic (long and drastic drought) and random (elimination of the
   forest coverage for agricultural purposes) disturbance events. The
   community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) responds to these
   changes, sporulating and reducing its activity during the dry season,
   and slowly reestablishing itself following abandonment of cultivated
   fields. To determine the dynamics of the AMP community in response to
   natural phenomena and anthropogenic disturbances, we collected soil
   samples during the wet and dry seasons from plots with different time
   periods since abandonment of agricultural activity, categorized as early
   (less than 5 years), middle (11-23 years), and late (over 30 years) age
   plots. From each plot, AMF spores were isolated and identified in order
   to estimate abundance, richness and diversity. In addition, the number
   of infective propagules and value of mycorrhizal inoculum potential were
   calculated for each plot. Twenty-three species were recorded, for which
   Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae were the most commonly represented
   families. Significant differences were found in AMP species richness
   among plots and seasons and the diversity index of AMP was higher than
   1.0 in most cases. There were no significant differences in spore
   abundance. Viable propagules were observed in all soil samples, with
   fluctuations relating mainly to time since abandonment. Overall,
   seasonality has a strong influence on AMF diversity but not on AMP
   infectivity, while time since abandonment had a more important impact.

   isothermal cylinder in contra-flow: Buoyancy and wall proximity effects
   on the flow response and wake structure},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {30-46},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are carried out in an
   experimental investigation of laminar opposing mixed convection to
   assess the thermal effects on the wake of an isothermal circular
   cylinder placed horizontally and confined inside a vertical closed-loop
   downward rectangular water channel. The buoyancy effect on the flow
   distributions are revealed for flow conditions with Reynolds number
   based on cylinder diameter of Re = 170, blockage ratio, D/H = 0.287,
   aspect ratio, L/D = 6.97 and values of the buoyancy parameter
   (Richardson number) in the range -1 <= Ri <= 5. In this work, flow
   distributions are presented in the form of mean and instantaneous
   contours of velocity and vorticity. To elucidate the effects of the
   lateral wall proximity effect and cylinder aspect ratio, separation
   angle, wake structure behind the cylinder, recirculation bubble length,
   time traces of velocity fluctuation, Strouhal number and vortex shedding
   modes are obtained as a function of the Richardson number. The results
   reported herein demonstrate how the flow structure and vortex shedding
   pattern are significantly modified by the wall confinement and thermal
   effects. In addition, our measurements show that for assisted buoyancy
   (Ri = -1), the breakdown of the Karman vortex street takes place and
   vortex shedding is completely suppressed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

   the diversity and genetic structure of five populations localized in
   Tlaxcala, Jalisco and Guerrero and known the effect of traditional use
   in the reduction of genetic variation. The genetic populations values
   has been obtained by electrophoresis with starch gel for 20 isozymes.
   The genetic diversity estimate for the mean of alleles by locus is A =
   2.0, the percentage of polymorphic loci is P = 100 \%, the calculated
   heterocygosis H-E is of 0.413 and the observed H-O of 0.388, the
   fixation index (F) is of 0.142. For genetic structure, F-IT is of 0.205,
   F-IS of 0.087 and F-ST of 0.128. The global diversity genetic is
   considered as high respect to others species with similar live history.
   However, to population level, the two of Tlaxcala and one of Jalisco the
   plants have high heterocygosis, probably by widespread pollination. In
   the populations of Guerrero and Jalisco, there are plants with high
   homocygosis and can be by some phenomen that limit the presence of
   pollination. By end, the results have demonstrated that the traditional
   use of the root don't have influence on the diversity and genetic

   patterns of ants communities in different managed areas in Central
   Mexico were studied. Three areas located in the Northwest of the State

   February to March 2009 in sets of four traps in random quadrants of 10
   m(2). The community composition and abundance shifted according to the
   site conditions. The values of richness and species diversity were
   higher in R in comparison with AN and ZC. The results suggest a relative
   effect of changes in floristic composition on ants' community. Species
   as Temnothorax sp. 1 and Crematogaster sp., were abundant in preserved

Title = {Bibliometric study of fires in tropical rain forests},
Booktitle = {ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {510-518},
Abstract = {Bibliometrics allows to analyze on behalf of literature searches the
   existing knowledge around a specific topic and identify tendencies in
   its development. Tropical forests are characterized naturally by a low
   regime of fires. However human activities have dramatically changed this
   phenomenon. Since tropical rain forests are a hot spot of world's
   diversity, we conducted a bibliometric study of occurrence and effects
   of fires in tropical rain-forests. The aim of this work is to identify
   the main tendencies in biological literature about this subject,
   diagnose knowledge areas with a poor development and to define the
   geographic location of the performed studies and their methodological
   approach. This analysis will allow to identify the main gaps in the
   research of fires in tropical rain forests and contribute to direction
   the following research projects. We retrieved more than 2000 documents
   of indexed journals from the following bibliographic databases: Web of
   Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Biosis and Zoological abstracts. We
   selected the papers of words related with forest fires and tropical rain
   forests by an advanced search using logic and boolean operators. We
   considered for this study the fields: the document title, authors,
   adscription institution, publication year, journal name,
   Keywords and descriptors, country, knowledge area and abstract. With
   this information we designed and normalized the database. Then, we
   considered all the papers focused on the study of fires in tropical
   forests and we classified other works that not specifically worked on
   fires but mention it as an important element of their studies. We did
   this by looking for the words ``fire{''} and ``tropical forest{''} in
   the
   Keywords and abstracts. Then we analysed the documents by their
   geographic location and by the field of knowledge. We found an
   increasing interest in this topic in the scientific community since
   early 1950 to the present. The journals with more works in the theme
   were Forest ecology and management and Biotropica. We consider that this
   bibliometric review will help to the decisions making.},

Abstract = {Let Gamma and Lambda be artin algebras such that Gamma is a

   Consider the change of rings functors G := (Gamma)Gamma(Lambda) circle

   this article, by assuming that I-Lambda is projective, we find the
   necessary and sufficient conditions under which a stratifying system
   (Theta, <=) in mod Lambda can be lifted to a stratifying system (G
   Theta, <=) in mod(Gamma). Furthermore, by using the functors F and G, we
   study the relationship between their filtered categories of modules; and
   some connections with their corresponding standardly stratified algebras
   are stated (see Theorem 5.12, Theorem 5.15 and Theorem 5.18). Finally, a
   sufficient condition is given for stratifying systems in mod(Gamma) in
   such a way that they can be restricted, through the functor F, to

Title = {Interdependence of NAFTA Capital Markets: A Minimum Variance Portfolio
   Approach},
Journal = {PANOECONOMICUS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {6},
Pages = {691-707},
Abstract = {We estimate the long-run relationships among NAFTA capital market
   returns and then calculate the weights of a ``time-varying minimum
   variance portfolio{''} that includes the Canadian, Mexican, and USA
   capital markets between March 2007 and March 2009, a period of intense
   turbulence in international markets. Our results suggest that the
   behavior of NAFTA market investors is not consistent with that of a
   theoretical ``risk-averse{''} agent during periods of high uncertainty
   and may be either considered as irrational or attributed to a possible
   ``home country bias{''}. This finding represents valuable information
   for portfolio managers and contributes to a better understanding of the
   nature of the markets in which they invest. It also has practical
   implications in the design of international portfolio investment
   policies.},

Title = {Differences in locomotor activity before and during the access to food

   Neotomodon alstoni},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {915-923},
Abstract = {The anticipatory locomotor activity to a restricted food access is one
   of the main behavioral references in experimental protocols that allow
   us observing a circadian food entrainable oscillator (FEO) in rodents.
   The persistence of the anticipatory activity to food access has been
   subject of diverse studies in order to explore the mechanism that
   generates this particular circadian oscillator; however, few studies
   involving obese animals in the expression of the FEO have been nowadays
   performed. Most of the attention has been focused in the anticipatory
   locomotor activity but other activity components have received less
   attention. In the present study, we compare the locomotor activity
   profile between lean and obese mice Neotomodon alstoni, a species that
   in vivarium conditions differentially develop obesity when fed regular
   chow rodent food. Freely moving locomotor activity was monitored by
   means of infrared light beams. A protocol consisting of 5 h food access
   during the light phase was performed on lean and obese mice in
   light-dark conditions and also, a protocol of complete darkness and 2
   days fasting was tested. Our results present differences in the amount
   of locomotor activity in each experimental condition, particularly, the
   anticipatory activity in obese is not as robust as in lean mice, but
   there is clearly an activity bout present during the food access in
   obese mice. Such component persists in fasting and constant darkness
   condition indicating that it may be part of the behavior expressed by
   the food entrained oscillator in obese mice.},

Abstract = {A taxonomical and ecological review of the available information about
   amoebae (gymnamoebae and testate) of Mexico was made considering 142
   publications in the 1841-2012 period. The total number of amoebae
   species found was 315. The dominant groups were Amebozoa, Rhizaria and
   Excavata with a significant contribution of the testate amoebae group
   besides gymnamoebae and acanthamoebid organisms. Most studies were
   performed in the states of the central area of Mexico, especially in
   Mexico City and its environs, corresponding to the location of the main
   research groups. Nine states have no studies on free-living amobae,
   including some of the regions with the higher biodiversity in Mexico as
   Chiapas, Tabasco and Yucatan. The first record of amoebae in our country
   was in 1841. The largest number of records comes from the decade of 1960
   of the last century and the number of records has maintained a trend of
   steady increase and the perspective is that there are still large
   numbers of undiscovered species, many of them essential to the
   functioning of many ecosystems. This is the first review focused
   exclusively on the status of free-living amoebae species in Mexico.},

   Sr3Ru2O7-delta compounds are presented. Sr3Ru2O7-delta compounds (delta

   of the parent Sr3Ru2O7 ruthenate. Rietveld structure refinements were
   performed to determine the crystal structure of the reduced compounds.
   Oxygen deficiency in the samples was studied by redox titrations and the
   Ru3+ content was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance.
   Magnetisation measurements were performed to study the magnetic response
   of the reduced phases. Removal of the oxygen atoms from the parent
   compound resulted in the decrease of the c-lattice parameter and
   increase of the a-lattice parameter that is related to partial reduction
   of Ru4+, in Sr3Ru2O7, to Ru3+. Rietveld analyses showed that the apical
   oxygen atoms of the RuO6 octahedra were partially lost during reduction.
   Redox titration experiments showed a linear correlation between
   reduction of the compounds and the annealing time under H-2.},

Abstract = {Paleobotany research has developed multiple analytical frameworks using
   plant macrofossils as a tool for paleoclimate inference. These
   frameworks can be broadly divided into two groups: the taxon independent
   approach (TIA) and the nearest living relative (NLR). The TIA studies
   climate- driven phenotypic variation in extant plants and extrapolates
   the relationship between climate and structure to make paleoclimatic
   inferences. The NLR, on the other hand, relies on the taxonomic
   identification of the species in fossil assemblages to assign them the
   climatic tolerances of their nearest living relatives. Both frameworks
   have proven to be useful but have intrinsic flaws due to the nature of
   the data used and the particular methods employed. Our target here is to
   highlight the significance of these frameworks, but also to point out
   that they do not always provide unequivocal paleoenvironmental data,
   which is the result of differences in both scale (geographic, temporal
   and taxonomic) and taphonomical processes. Here we illustrate some of
   the advantages and flaws of both frameworks using three examples of
   paleoclimate inference for some Mexican localities. In this paper we
   briefly review as well some of the relevant research relating leaf and
   wood structure to environmental variation that has served as the
   foundation for the field.},

Title = {Testing the roles of competition, facilitation and stochasticity on
   community structure in a species-rich assemblage},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate about whether communities are closely
   integrated and bound together via interactions such as competition or
   facilitation, or are disintegrated and dominated by chance. We still
   lack community-wide data on the intensities of interactions and
   randomness, and measurements of their impacts on community structure.
   Using a long-term data set, we sought to measure the effects of
   interactions and stochasticity in structuring a highly diverse (>100
   species) semi-arid grassland plant community, testing for positive and
   negative interactions at different stages of population growth of all
   species. During the colonization of new patches, most species were
   facilitated or inhibited by several others. These opposite effects can
   potentially have a large effect on species abundances, but they were
   correlated and cancelled out at the community level. Nevertheless,
   competition during colonization was strong enough to cause poor
   competitors to have small population sizes. The subsequent phase of
   population growth (increase and subsequent change in numbers within
   occupied patches) was mainly driven by intraspecific density dependence,
   and we found little evidence for interspecific interactions. Model
   results showed that stochasticity and recurrent colonization of
   transient, favourable patches maintained diversity, keeping poor
   competitors from becoming extinct.Synthesis: Our results, taken together
   with recent studies on tropical forests, suggest that weak interactions
   among established plants may be a general phenomenon, but that local
   interactions during colonization are important drivers of community
   composition. Most of the variance in species abundance in our community
   was explained by intraspecific competition and stochasticity, with
   interspecific interactions playing a minor role due to their overall
   weakness, interaction changes over ontogeny, and the cancellation of
   opposite-sign interactions when all the species in the community are
   considered. Despite this, some species were rare seemingly because they
   cannot withstand interspecific competition. Thus, to untangle the
   effects of interactions on community structure, future research should
   focus on interactions occurring at different phases of population growth
   and on whole communities.},

Abstract = {Heth gordae n. sp., H. xarochae n. sp. and H. tuxtlensis n. sp. from the
   intestine of spiroboloids from Mexico are described herein. Females of
   H. gordae n. sp. and H. xarochae n. sp. can be differentiated from all
   other described species of Heth from the Americas by the presence of two
   sets of lateral spines with multiple cusps with a common broad base
   arranged in a semilunar shape pattern. Heth gordae n. sp. exhibits a
   narrower pattern that resembles more a comb-like structure, whereas H.
   xarochae n sp. exhibits a broader pattern. Both aforementioned species
   resemble H. hexaspinosum from Panama, but the latter possesses fewer
   spines without a common base. Lateral spines with multiple cusps have
   never been previously described in the genus Heth. Females of H.
   tuxtlensis n. sp. resemble Asian collar lappet-species but differ from
   them in possessing a complete uninterrupted collar with indented single
   lateral lappets. Specific characters described herein set these species
   apart from the Caribbean Heth species, most South American, and those
   previously described from Mexico. The present descriptions increase the
   number of Heth species recorded from Mexico from three to six.},

Abstract = {The superfamily Curculionoidea includes approximately 62 000 species and
   5 800 genera, assigned to 7 families (Nemonychidae, Anthribidae,
   Belidae, Attelabidae, Caridae, Brentidae, and Curculionidae). In Mexico,
   there have been described 603 genera and 3 594 species, with ca. 40\% of
   endemic species, belonging to 6 families, the only one absent in the
   country is Caridae. Nearly 85\% of the Mexican weevil species belong to
   the family Curculionidae, and are classified in the subfamilies
   Baridinae, Brachycerinae, Cossoninae, Curculioninae, Cyclominae,
   Dryophthorinae, Entiminae, Molytinae, Platypodinae, and Scolytinae.
   Taxonomic studies on Mexican Curculionoidea are relatively scarce, and
   neither modern revisionary studies nor phylogenetic analyses are
   available for the majority of the taxa. Although they are important
   components of all terrestrial natural ecosystems, information on their
   ecology, natural history, and immature stages is still not available for
   most species.},

Abstract = {The present work is divided into three parts. First we study the null
   hypersurfaces of the Minkowski space R-1(n+2), classifying all rotation
   null hypersurfaces in R-1(n+2). In the second part we start our analysis
   of the submanifold geometry of the null hypersurfaces. In the particular
   case of the (n + 1)-dimensional light cone, we characterize its totally
   umbilical spacelike hypersurfaces, show the existence of non-totally
   umbilical ones and give a uniqueness result for the minimal spacelike
   rotation surfaces in the 3-dimensional light cone. In the third and
   final part we consider an isolated umbilical point on a spacelike
   surface immersed in the 3-dimensional light cone of R-1(4) and obtain
   the differential equation of the principal configuration associated to
   this point, showing that every classical generic Darbouxian principal
   configuration appears in this context. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {We present an update to the knowledge of bird diversity in Mexico. We
   assembled a list of the birds of Mexico including all species for which
   presence, recent or historical, has been confirmed, and incorporating
   recent taxonomic viewpoints. From this list, we obtained numbers of
   species and taxonomic richness, seasonal status, ecological
   distribution, and conservation status. Of the roughly 10 500 bird
   species currently recognized, 1 123 to 1 150 (11\%) are found in Mexico,
   what ranks the country in the 11th position in bird species richness,
   and in 4th in the proportion of endemic species. Mexican avifauna is
   largely composed of resident species; however, migratory and transitory
   species are also important components. Similarly, a large proportion
   (77\%) of the species breed in Mexico. Endemism levels are high: 194 to
   212 species are included in some endemism category. Between 32-44\% of
   the Mexican bird species has been rated with some level of threat
   according to national and international listings. Geographically, the
   highest species richness is located in contact areas between lowland and
   mountains in both slopes and along the lowlands of the in Gulf slope and
   the Yucatan Peninsula; endemism is mainly located in western Mexico:
   mainly along the Pacific slope and in mountains in the Transvolcanic
   Mexican Belt, the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Sierra Madre del Sur;
   in the Atlantic slope, endemism is higher along the Sierra Madre
   Oriental.},

Title = {SEASONAL CHANGES IN EPIPHYTIC DINOFLAGELLATE ASSEMBLAGES NEAR THE

Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {107},
Pages = {121-151},
Abstract = {Epiphytic dinoflagellates were studied in 250 samples from 10 sites in
   Chelem (a semi-enclosed mangrove lagoon) and Dzilam de Bravo (an exposed
   coastal locality), on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula,
   during five surveys in 2008-2009. Temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH,
   dissolved oxygen, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, silicates, urea,
   extractable water column chlorophyll-a, precipitation, and wind speed
   and direction were measured. The Chelem lagoon system showed minor
   variability in physical-chemical characteristics compared to the exposed
   site at Dzilam de Bravo. Dinoflagellates were associated with all the
   host macrophytes examined including four seagrass species and 33
   macroalgal species representing 24 genera. A total of 20 dinoflagellate
   taxa from 12 genera were recovered from these substrates. The genus
   Prorocentrum contained the largest number of individual species. The
   variation in mean epiphytic dinoflagellate abundance over both
   localities ranged from similar to 200 to 3500 cells g(-1) substrate wet
   weight. Cell abundances at individual sites, in contrast, ranged from
   similar to 100 to >25 000 cells g(-1) substrate wet weight. This
   variation is typical of the patchy distribution of these species in time
   and space. Overall, Prorocentrum rhathymum (up to 2.41x10(4) cells
   g(-1)) was the most abundant species observed across samples. Other
   abundant species were Bysmatrum caponii (maximum of 1.19x10(4) cells
   g(-1)) and Amphidinium cf. carterae (maximum of 3.69x10(3) cells g(-1)).
   The highest abundances of Gambierdiscus species occurred in May and
   November (9.90x10(3) cells g(-1)) in Chelem when temperatures ranged
   from 24.5 to 30.2 degrees C. The data obtained indicate that the
   greatest potential for ciguatoxin flux into the food web may occur in
   protected, low turbulence environments, where salinities are high,
   nutrients abundant, and water temperatures are between 24 and 31 degrees
   C.},

   Mexico: Maya subsistence hunting in a conservation conflict context},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {781-795},
Abstract = {Conservation conflicts can arise in biosphere reserves when local people
   face restrictions on resource use and access, mainly in terms of
   subsistence. We studied the potential conservation conflict with
   subsistence hunting in two Maya communities (Los Petenes and El Remate)
   located in the zone of influence of Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve,
   Mexico. Perceptions, interests and expectations of stakeholders
   regarding subsistence hunting in the reserve were recorded through
   semi-structured and in-depth interviews of peasant-hunters and reserve
   authorities, and participant observation was carried out in both
   communities. A total of 66 peasant-hunters were identified in Los
   Petenes (62\%) and El Remate (38\%). Overall, peasant-hunters
   acknowledged hunting for family subsistence and expressed the conviction
   to continue hunting in the region. They mentioned their enthusiasm for
   hunting, mainly individually and aimed at obtaining white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) and perceived a recent reduction in potential
   prey locally. Although the law in Mexico does not prohibit subsistence
   hunting, external authorities stated that they have announced a
   generalized ban on hunting based on the precautionary principle to
   simplify enforcement both inside and outside the reserve. The de facto
   restriction on wildlife use, even for subsistence purposes, which was
   mentioned by external actors, conflicted with the local need and
   expectation of the contemporary Maya hunters to continue subsistence
   hunting in the region. Our study confirms the existence of a
   conservation conflict associated with this traditional practice in the
   reserve and provides necessary information for managing such conflict.},

Title = {The Gap and the Upper Critical Field Hc2 as Function of
   Doping for High-Tc Cuprates},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Therelation between the d-wave superconducting gap Delta(0) and the
   specific heat obtained with the Volovik effect is used to determine the
   upper critical field H-c2 as doping function, for high-temperature
   superconductors. A two-components model with d-wave symmetry, within the
   BCS framework, is introduced to describe the superconducting state.
   Generalized Fermi surface topologies are used in order to increase the
   density of states at the Fermi level, allowing the high-T-c values
   observed. The electron-phonon interaction is considered the most
   relevant mechanism for the high-T-c cuprates, where the available phonon
   energy is provided by the half-breathing modes. The energy gap values
   Delta(0) calculated with this model are introduced to describe the
   variation of the upper critical field H-c2 as function of doping, for
   La2-xSrxCuO4.},

Abstract = {Animal models in medical research has been used to study humans diseases
   for several decades. The use of different imaging techniques together
   with different animal models offers a great advantage due to the
   possibility to study some human pathologies without the necessity of
   chirurgical intervention. The employ of magnetic resonance imaging for
   the acquisition of anatomical and functional images is an excellent tool
   because its noninvasive nature. Dedicated coils to perform magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments are obligatory due to the improvement on
   the signal-to-noise ratio and reduced specific absorption ratio. A
   specifically designed surface coil for magnetic resonance imaging of
   monkey's brain is proposed based on the multi circular-slot coil.
   Numerical simulations of the magnetic and electric fields were also
   performed using the Finite Integration Method to solve Maxwell's
   equations for this particular coil design and, to study the behavior of
   various vector magnetic field configurations and specific absorption
   ratio. Monkey's brain images were then acquired with a
   research-dedicated magnetic resonance imaging system at 4T, to evaluate
   the anatomical images with conventional imaging sequences. This coil
   showed good quality images of a monkey's brain and full compatibility
   with standard pulse sequences implemented in research-dedicated imager.},

Title = {Dynamics of High-Risk Nonvaccine Human Papillomavirus Types after Actual
   Vaccination Scheme},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as the main etiological
   factor in the developing of cervical cancer ( CC). This finding has
   propitiated the development of vaccines that help to prevent the HPVs 16
   and 18 infection. Both genotypes are associated with 70\% of CC
   worldwide. In the present study, we aimed to determine the emergence of
   high-risk nonvaccine HPV after actual vaccination scheme to estimate the
   impact of the current HPV vaccines. ASIR-type model was used to study
   the HPV dynamics after vaccination. According to the results, our model
   indicates that the application of the vaccine reduces infection by
   target or vaccine genotypes as expected. However, numerical simulations
   of the model suggest the presence of the phenomenon called vaccine
   induced pathogen strain replacement. Here, we report the following
   replacement mechanism: if the effectiveness of cross-protective immunity
   is not larger than the effectiveness of the vaccine, then the high-risk
   nonvaccine genotypes emerge. In this scenario, further studies of
   infection dispersion by HPV are necessary to ascertain the real impact
   of the current vaccines, primarily because of the different high-risk
   HPV types that are found in CC.},

Title = {CracidMex1: a comprehensive database of global occurrences of cracids
   (Aves, Galliformes) with distribution in Mexico},
Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2014},
Number = {420},
Pages = {87-115},
Abstract = {Cracids are among the most vulnerable groups of Neotropical birds.
   Almost half of the species of this family are included in a conservation
   risk category. Twelve taxa occur in Mexico, six of which are considered
   at risk at national level and two are globally endangered. Therefore, it
   is imperative that high quality, comprehensive, and high-resolution
   spatial data on the occurrence of these taxa are made available as a
   valuable tool in the process of defining appropriate management
   strategies for conservation at a local and global level. We constructed
   the CracidMex1 database by collating global records of all cracid taxa
   that occur in Mexico from available electronic databases, museum
   specimens, publications, ``grey literature{''}, and unpublished records.
   We generated a database with 23,896 clean, validated, and standardized
   geographic records. Database quality control was an iterative process
   that commenced with the consolidation and elimination of duplicate
   records, followed by the geo-referencing of records when necessary, and
   their taxonomic and geographic validation using GIS tools and expert
   knowledge. We followed the geo-referencing protocol proposed by the
   Mexican National Commission for the Use and Conservation of
   Biodiversity. We could not estimate the geographic coordinates of 981
   records due to inconsistencies or lack of sufficient information in the
   description of the locality.
   Given that current records for most of the taxa have some degree of
   distributional bias, with redundancies at different spatial scales, the
   CracidMex1 database has allowed us to detect areas where more sampling
   effort is required to have a better representation of the global spatial
   occurrence of these cracids. We also found that particular attention
   needs to be given to taxa identification in those areas where congeners
   or conspecifics co-occur in order to avoid taxonomic uncertainty. The
   construction of the CracidMex1 database represents the first
   comprehensive research effort to compile current, available global
   geographic records for a group of cracids. The database can now be
   improved by continuous revision and addition of new records. The
   CracidMex1 database will provide high quality input data that could be
   used to generate species distribution models, to assess temporal changes
   in species distributions, to identify priority areas for research and
   conservation, and in the definition of management strategies for this
   bird group. This compilation exercise could be replicated for other
   cracid groups or regions to attain a better knowledge of the global
   occurrences of the species in this vulnerable bird family.},

Abstract = {This work attempts to rationalize the possible prebiotic profile of the
   first dipeptides of about 4 billion years ago based on a computational
   discrete dynamic system that uses the final yields of the dipeptides
   obtained in Rode's experiments of salt-induced peptide formation (Rode
   et al., 1999, Peptides 20: 773-786). The system built a prebiotic
   scenario that allowed us to observe that (i) the primordial peptide
   generation was strongly affected by the abundances of the amino acid
   monomers, (ii) small variations in the concentration of the monomers
   have almost no effect on the final distribution pattern of the
   dipeptides and (iii) the most plausible chemical reaction of prebiotic
   peptide bond formation can be linked to Rode's hypothesis of a
   salt-induced scenario. The results of our computational simulations were
   related to former simulations of the Miller, and Fox \& Harada
   experiments on amino acid monomer and oligomer generation, respectively,
   offering additional information to our approach.},

Abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in rainwater were studied in
   two distinct areas in Mexico City Metropolitan Area throughout the rainy
   season. The results showed no significant difference between the two
   sites, thus suggesting a more regional phenomenon driving the
   dissolution of the PAHs in the rain. The PAHs concentration ranged from
   1.7-30.2 ngL(-1)with the predominance of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and
   pyrene. The PAH sources were traced predominantly to vehicular emission
   with signature PAHs, diagnostic ratios, and cluster statistical
   analyses. On the other hand, the temporal analysis of the PAHs showed
   that the fluxes of the Total PAH were slightly different for both sites.
   The urban-industrial site showed fluxes that ranged from 145-3263ng
   m(-2)d(-1), while the urban site ranged from 134-3139ng m(-2)d(-1), with
   the urban site having a moderate rate at which the total PAHs diminished
   throughout the rainy season while the urban-industrial showed no change
   throughout the rainy season. This study also addressed two occurrences
   when studying PAHs in rain: the degradation of PAHs in the samples with
   acidic rain and the dilution of the PAH in the samples with continued
   collection of rain.},

Title = {Can preference for crabs in juvenile Octopus maya be
   modified through early experience with alternative prey?},
Journal = {BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {151},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1597-1616},
Abstract = {Previous studies on cephalopod feeding have suggested that predetermined
   preference for certain prey types can be modified by exposing newly
   hatched individuals to visual or chemical stimuli (imprinting), or by
   familiarizing them to feed on prey different from those preferred
   (associative learning). The aim of our study was to determine whether
   preference to attack crabs in Octopus maya could be modified by early
   experience with or without food reinforcement using palaemonid shrimp, a
   prey octopuses consume readily, but will reject if crabs are available.
   We conducted experiments on the attack response of juvenile octopuses
   that had been either exposed to (visual and chemical stimuli for at
   least 48 h before and after hatching) or had fed only on palaemonids (16
   days after hatching). Octopuses were then presented with crabs and
   palaemonids simultaneously and attacks on either prey were recorded.
   Control treatments, where octopuses had to choose between two similar
   alternatives (no choice) were included in order to discriminate between
   active and passive selection. Results were analysed by means of
   asymmetrical chi(2) contingency tables. Both, octopuses that had only
   been exposed to stimuli from palaemonids and those that fed on shrimp,
   selectively attacked crabs when first presented with both alternative
   prey chi(2) = 6.09 and chi(2) = 5.01, respectively; both p < 0.05).
   These results indicate that preference for crabs in early juvenile O.
   maya could not be modified through experience with other prey. Because
   octopuses had never been in contact with crabs prior to trials, such
   preference was not obtained through their short life experience but
   could be pre-determined.},

Abstract = {Species of EpipolopsHerrich-Schaeffer (Hemiptera: Geocoridae),
   comprising the largest genus of Pamphantinae, are among the most bizarre
   true bugs because of their striking morphology. To elucidate
   evolutionary morphology in Epipolops, a phylogenetic analysis was
   performed using 17 species and 36 adult morphological characters. Two
   cladograms were obtained under equal and implied weight analyses,
   showing slight differences between them. Two new species,
   E.stridulatussp.n. and E.univallensissp.n., are described, and
   E.meridionalisPiran is resurrected from synonymy with
   E.frondosusHerrich-Schaeffer. A key to the known species of Epipolops is
   provided. The systematic relevance of the unique characters of the genus
   is discussed and the sequence of character state transformations for
   both the anterior and posterior lateral processes of the pronotum are
   optimized on the cladogram obtained under implied weights. Species of
   Epipolops are found in the Neotropical region and the Mexican Transition
   Zone, with some clades and species restricted to certain South American
   subregions. This published work has been registered in ZooBank,

Abstract = {The susceptibility effects of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
   (SPIONs) functionalized with triethylenglycol (TREG) and Polyethylen
   Glycol (PEG) has been studied, those nanoparticles have the necessary
   properties to be used in the clinic as contrast media in imaging by
   MRI{[}1-3]. We are considering the behavior of the magnetic field as
   plane wave to explain the electrical and magnetic field produced by
   SPIONs. Images were acquired on a 1.5T imager Philips, using mFFE
   Sequence. Three glass capillary tubes with a) TREG (10nm) concentration
   of 300 mu g/ml, and PEGCOOH 6000(10nm) with 300 mu g/ml, and 2\%
   agarosa. Magnetic field simulations were calculated in Matlab. The plane
   wave that comes in contact with a sphere of radius a, an propagation
   constant k1, and it is in an homogeneous space k2. We consider that the
   electric field is linearly polarized on x-direction, with a propagation
   on z-positive-axis. The secondary induced field can be explained from
   the interior of the sphere and valid exterior points. The referred waves
   are transmitted and reflected, this is valid only when the wavelength is
   smaller than the radius of the sphere. The obtained vibrational mode is
   an answer of the electrical oscillation and this is projection of the
   disturbed magnetic field. TREG-SPIONs produce more serious
   susceptibility artefacts compared to PEG-SPIONs. This study is
   promissory due to the concordance of the results of the simulations and
   the inhomogeneities showed in the MR images.},

Abstract = {Red harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) inhabits deserts of USA and
   Mexico. Its activity patterns are well known in temperate deserts, but
   they have not been studied in tropical ones. We studied these patterns
   in the Tehucan Valley, a tropical desert in central Mexico. It had
   bimodal activity patterns in spring, summer, and fall while unimodal
   patterns in winter. These patterns differ from those reported for this
   species in temperate deserts where activity stopped in winter. Our
   results suggest that P. barbatus extends its activity periods and
   remains active all year round in the Tehuacan Valley.},

Abstract = {A low-pressure DC plasma discharge sustained in a 85.0\% N-2-12.0\%

   Ar-5.0\% CH4 ternary mixtures are studied. These plasmas were generated
   in the total pressure range of 0.5 to 10.0 Torr and power of 7 W. The
   diagnostic has been made by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) using a
   spectrometer. The principal species observed were: at 315.93, 337.13,
   375.54, 399.84 and 405.94 nm for N-2 (C-3 Pi(u) - B-3 Pi(g)); at 354.89,
   358.21, 376.16, 391.44 and 427.81 nm for N-2(+)(B-2 Sigma(+)(u) - X-2
   Sigma(+)(g)); at 381.06 nm for CH+(A(1)Pi - X-1 Sigma); at 392.08 nm for
   CN(B-2 Sigma - X-2 Sigma), at 428.15 nm for CN(B-2 Sigma - A(2)Pi) and
   at 708.87 nm for CN(A(2)Pi - X-2 Sigma); at 436.52, 592.34, 653.40,
   667.73 and 708.32 nm for C-2(A(3)Pi(g) - X-3 Pi(u)); at 392.59 nm for
   C-3((1)Pi(u) - (1)Sigma(+)(g)); at 486.14 nm for H(sic); at 486.13 and
   656.27 nm for H-alpha; at 657.80 nm for C+; at 739.23,751.47,763.51,
   772.42, 794.82 and 811.53 nm for Ar. We present the behaviour of the
   bands and lines intensities as a function of the pressure and
   concentration of Ar, N-2 and CH4 gases. Also, we display more
   quantitatively the ratios of intensities of N-2(+) (391.44 nm), CN
   (392.08 nm), and H (486.13 nm) to that of the N-2 (337.13 nm) as
   function of pressure. The ratios show a slow decreasing behavior as a
   function of the pressure. Being the CH/N-2 ratio more highest and H/N-2
   ratio the lowest one. The variations of excited species at different
   pressures may change the subsequent chemical reactions in the gas phase
   significantly. The present results suggest that the ion-molecule and
   molecule-molecule reactions in the gas phase are likely to play a
   dominant role in the present pressures.},

Abstract = {Background: The aetiological relationship between human papillomavirus
   (HPV) infection and cervical cancer (CC) is widely accepted. Our goal
   was to determine the prevalence of HPV types in Mexican women attending
   at the Mexican Institute for Social Security from different areas of
   Mexico. Materials and Methods: DNAs from 2,956 cervical samples were
   subjected to HPV genotyping: 1,020 samples with normal cytology, 931
   with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), 481 with high
   grade HGSIL and 524 CC. Results: Overall HPV prevalence was 67.1\%. A
   total of 40 HPV types were found; HPV16 was detected in 39.4\% of the
   HPV-positive samples followed by HPV18 at 7.5\%, HPV31 at 7.1\%, HPV59
   at 4.9\%, and HPV58 at 3.2\%. HPV16 presented the highest prevalence
   both in women with altered or normal cytology and HPV 18 presented a
   minor prevalence as reported worldwide. The prevalence ratio (PR) was
   calculated for the HPV types. The analysis of PR showed that HPV16
   presents the highest association with CC, HPV 31, -33, -45, -52 and -58
   also demonstrating a high association. Conclusions: The most prevalent
   HPV types in cervical cancer samples were -16, -18, -31, but it is
   important to note that we obtained a minor prevalence of HPV18 as
   reported worldwide, and that HPV58 and -52 also were genotypes with an
   important prevalence in CC samples. Determination of HPV genotypes is
   very important in order to evaluate the impact of vaccine introduction
   and future cervical cancer prevention strategies.},

Abstract = {We present a biochemical physics model accounting for the dynamics and
   energetics of both translational and rotational protein motors. A
   modified version of the hand-over-hand mechanism considering competitive
   inhibition by ADP is presented. Transition state-like theory is used to
   reconstruct the time dependent free-energy landscape of the cycle
   catalyst process that allows to predicting the number of steps or
   rotations that a single motor can perform. In addition, following the
   usual approach of chemical kinetics, we calculate the average
   translational velocity and also the stopping time of processes involving
   a collectivity of motors, such as exocytosis and endocytosis processes.
   Finally, we formulate a stochastic model reproducing very well single
   realizations of kinesin and rotary ATPases.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal
   interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by
   epithelial cell injury and aberrant activation, expansion of the
   mesenchymal cell population with the formation of
   fibroblast/myofibroblast foci, and exaggerated extracellular matrix
   accumulation. IPF is an aging-related disease, and most patients are
   over 60 years of age at the time of clinical presentation and diagnosis.
   Age also influences mortality, and the median survival time is
   significantly shorter in older individuals compared with younger
   patients. However, the fundamental mechanisms linking aging to IPF
   remain unclear. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the
   modifications naturally occurring in the elderly that may be implicated
   in the pathogenesis of IPF, including endoplasmic reticulum stress,
   oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated autophagy,
   telomere attrition, and a number of epigenetic changes.},

Journal = {ISRAELI JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE-BAMIDGEH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {66},
Abstract = {The digestibility of pre-selected ingredients was evaluated for
   Epinephelus morio using pH-stat and multi-enzyme extract (stomach,
   intestine, and ceca). The degree of hydrolysis (DH) was tested with acid
   and alkaline proteases using crustacean meals, squid meal, fish protein
   concentrate (FPC), fish meal, dried whey, as well as canola paste (w/or
   w/o phytase), soybean meal (w/or w/o phytase), soyprotein concentrate
   (SPC), and wheat gluten. SPC produced DH values between 3.6-4.1\%,
   obtained from the three different parts of the digestive tract. Canola
   paste produced high DH in the stomach by adding phytase to 0.8 and 2\%
   feed. This process was repeated under alkaline conditions for DH, with
   0.6-2.6\% in the pyloric ceca, and 1-2.2\% in the intestine. The DH from
   stomach with crustacean meals (shrimp meal and crab meal) ranged from
   32-87\%, while values for dried whey from the ceca and intestine ranged
   from 6-7.4\%. It did not differ from crab meal with values of 4.5 and
   8.7\% from pyloric ceca and intestine respectively. Based on the above
   results, 4 diets were developed using shrimp meal, dried whey, soy
   protein concentrate, and canola+ phytase. The DH, FAA (fish amino acid)
   and SDS-PAGE (analysis of protein gels) for each diet were analysed.
   After an in vivo test, results on juveniles fed whey protein diet (WPd)
   and CPd+ ranked high (95\% and 92\% respectively) compared with other
   treatments. pH-Stat provided consistent results regarding digestibility
   of selected protein sources. Therefore, dried whey, shrimp meal, and
   canola+ phytase ranked first to be included in E. morio feed formulation
   with a pool of 55\% of these components, complemented with a minimum of
   fish meal, FPC, grains and wheat gluten.},

Abstract = {Cancellous bone is a complex tissue that performs physiological and
   biomechanical functions in all vertebrates. It is made up of trabeculae
   that, from a simplified structural viewpoint, can be considered as
   plates and beams in a hyperstatic structure that change with time
   leading to osteoporosis. Several methods has been developed to study the
   trabecular bone microstructure among them is the Biot's model which
   predicts the existence of two longitudinal waves in porous media; the
   slow and the fast waves, that can be related to porosity of the media.
   This paper is focused on the experimental detection of the two Biot's
   waves of a trabecular bone phantom, consisting of a trabecular network
   of inorganic hydroxyapatite. Experimental measurements of both waves
   were performed using through transmission ultrasound. Results had shown
   clearly that the propagation of two waves propagation is transversal to
   the trabecular alignment. Otherwise the waves are overlapped and a
   single wave seems to be propagated. To validate these results, magnetic
   resonance images were acquired to assess the trabecular direction, and
   to assure that the pulses correspond to the slow and fast waves. This
   approach offers a methodology for non-invasive studies of trabecular
   bones.},

   for human applications. Our coil prototype had a 2 cm total diameter and
   six circular slots and was developed for murine spinal cord at 7 T.
   Electromagnetic simulations of the slotted and circular coils were also
   performed to compute the spatially dependent magnetic and electric
   fields using a simulated saline-solution sphere. The quality factor of
   both coils was experimentally measured giving a lower noise figure and a
   higher quality factor for the slotted coil outperforming the circular
   coil. Images of the spinal cord of a rat were acquired using standard
   pulse sequences. The slotted surface coil can be a good tool for spinal
   cord rat imaging using conventional pulse sequences at 7 T.},

Title = {Nonadiabatic structure instability of planar hexagonal gold cluster
   cation Au7 and its spectral signature},
Journal = {RSC ADVANCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {16},
Pages = {8157-8164},
Abstract = {Determining the structure for gold nanoclusters at which the 2D-3D
   transition occurs has been a challenging problem for both theoretical
   and experimental studies. For gold cation clusters, quantum chemistry
   calculations have produced controversial results concerning the last
   most stable planar structure, some indicating that corresponds to n = 7,
   whereas others conclude that at this value, the structure is already 3D.
   Experimentally, ion mobility spectroscopy measurements, assisted by DFT
   calculations, have been interpreted as a planar structure for Au-7(+).
   Here, we show that the usually assumed 2D non-degenerate ground state
   cluster structure for Au-7(+) with D-6h symmetry is unstable against a
   puckering distortion, ending in a 3D stable structure with D-3d
   symmetry. The analysis is based on the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect through
   vibronic coupling between the ground state and two excited states. This
   structure presents, in average, the same surface area than the 2D, being
   therefore compatible with experimental results. We discuss the effects
   the vibronic coupling would have on Raman, IR and UV-vis spectra. The
   study is based on a scalar and spin orbit relativistic DFT calculation
   in the Zero Order Regular Approximation (ZORA).},

Abstract = {A common problem in the statistical characterization of the excitation
   spectrum of quantum systems is the adequate separation of global
   system-dependent properties from the local fluctuations that are
   universal. In this process, called unfolding, the functional form to
   describe the global behaviour is often imposed externally on the data
   and can introduce arbitrarities in the statistical results. In this
   contribution, we show that a quantum excitation spectrum can readily be
   interpreted as a time series, before any previous unfolding. An
   advantage of the time-series approach is that specialized methods such
   as Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) can be used to perform the unfolding
   procedure in a data-adaptive way. We will show how SSA separates the
   components that describe the global properties from the components that
   describe the local fluctuations. The partial variances, associated with
   the fluctuations, follow a definite power law that distinguishes between
   soft and rigid excitation spectra. The data-adaptive fluctuation and
   trend components can be used to reconstruct customary fluctuation
   measures without ambiguities or artifacts introduced by an arbitrary
   unfolding, and also define the global level density of the excitation
   spectrum. The method is applied to nuclear shell-model calculations for
   Ca-48, using a realistic force and Two-Body Random Ensemble (TBRE)
   interactions. We show that the statistical results are very robust
   against a variation in the parameters of the SSA method.},

Abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive technique that allows the
   medical diagnostic via clinical images. MRI has been employed to study
   the cardiac function during the last 20 years. There are different
   techniques in clinical cardiac MR that allow studying the heart {[}1].
   These techniques acquire several images in a short acquisition time and
   are repeated sequentially to display the heart functionally. The main
   objective of this research is to analyze the acquired images, which have
   been obtained with a standard heart acquisition sequence, with the
   computation of the entropy of the image to detect cardiac cycles. Images
   of the heart were segmented and processed to find the systolic and
   diastolic cycles.},

Title = {Cephalopod Culture: Current Status of Main Biological Models and

Series = {Advances in Marine Biology},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {A recent revival in using cephalopods as experimental animals has
   rekindled interest in their biology and life cycles, information with
   direct applications also in the rapidly growing ornamental aquarium
   species trade and in commercial aquaculture production for human
   consumption. Cephalopods have high rates of growth and food conversion,
   which for aquaculture translates into short culture cycles, high ratios
   of production to biomass and high cost-effectiveness.
   However, at present, only small-scale culture is possible and only for a
   few species: the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, the loliginid squid
   Sepioteuthis lessoniana and the octopuses Octopus maya and O. vulgaris.
   These four species are the focus of this chapter, the aims of which are
   as follows: (1) to provide an overview of the culture requirements of
   cephalopods, (2) to highlight the physical and nutritional requirements
   at each phase of the life cycle regarded as essential for successful
   full-scale culture and (3) to identify current limitations and the
   topics on which further research is required.
   Knowledge of cephalopod culture methods is advanced, but
   commercialization is still constrained by the highly selective feeding
   habits of cephalopods and their requirement for large quantities of
   high-quality (preferably live) feed, particularly in the early stages of
   development. Future research should focus on problems related to the
   consistent production of viable numbers of juveniles, the resolution of
   which requires a better understanding of nutrition at all phases of the
   life cycle and better broodstock management, particularly regarding
   developments in genetic selection, control of reproduction and quality
   of eggs and offspring.},

Title = {Assessment of lipid classes and fatty acid levels in wild newborn

   survival and growth in aquarium culture},

Abstract = {There is a worldwide interest in seahorse culture to protect wild
   populations from human predation for aquaria and to establish an
   industry in developing countries. This study was undertaken to gather
   information on the lipid and fatty acid status of wild caught seahorses
   to inform the development of aquarium diets. Brood size, lipid classes,
   fatty acids, and pigments were analyzed in newborn Hippocampus erectus
   juveniles from recently captured pregnant wild males during
   January-March 2009-2010. The lipids of newborn seahorses are composed of
   phospholipids (mean 75-80\%), free cholesterol (8-10\%), cholesterol
   esters (4-9\%), and acylglycerides (3-11\%). The main pigments were
   total carotenoids (mean 58-79 mu g/g). The most abundant fatty acids in
   newborn seahorses were 22:6n-3 (21-27\%) and 20:4n-6 (7-9\%). Both were
   higher than levels reported in other seahorses. A factor analysis showed
   that PC1 (48.7\% of variation) was composed of the three main highly
   unsaturated fatty acids:20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and a negative contribution of
   22:6n-3. PC2 contributed 18:5n-3 and several branched fatty acids. PC3
   contributed 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. Each of these three components
   correlated with different environmental factors. The results suggested
   that high levels of 22:6n-3 rather than 20:5n-3 could increase juvenile
   survival and assist them to tolerate salinity changes better. The
   results also suggest that a diet of live prey enriched with 22:6n-3
   would be likely to increase the growth and survival in captivity, at
   least for this species.},

Title = {Genetic relationship among Paspalum species of the subgenus
   Anachyris: Taxonomic and evolutionary implications},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {209},
Number = {10},
Pages = {604-612},
Abstract = {Paspalum is one of the most important genera of the Poaceae family due
   to its large number of species and diversity. The subgenus Anachyris
   comprises six species mainly from South America grouped together by
   sharing rare spikelet characteristics. A genetic analysis using ISSR
   markers, compared with the morphological and phenotypic variation
   observed in each one species, was used to establish genetic
   relationships among 40 accessions with several ploidy levels, belonging
   to 5 species of the subgenus Anachyris. Fourteen accessions of Paspalum
   malacophyllum (2x and 4x), 12 of P. simplex (2x, 3x, 4x and 6x), 4 of P.
   procurrens (2x and 4x), 4 of P. usterii (4x) and 6 of P. volcanensis
   (4x) were analysed. A total of 227 ISSR loci (98.7\% polymorphic) were
   detected among all accessions, with variable loci number and percentages
   of polymorphism according to species delimitations. Six main groups were
   identified by cluster analysis based on Jaccard's genetic distance and
   UPGMA; four of which matched all the respective accessions of P.
   simplex, P. procurrens, P. usterii and P. volcanensis, while the other
   two were consistent with two different groups of accessions of P.
   malacophyllum, one involving most tetraploid accessions, and the other
   one grouping together a tetraploid and two diploid accessions. The
   distinctive morphological characteristics and the separate clustering of
   these tetraploid and diploid cytotypes suggest to consider a new
   multiploid species complex inside the subgenus Anachyris. Both cytotypes
   of P. procurrens, and the four co-specific cytotypes of P. simplex
   consistently clustered together forming two specific groups for the two
   multiploid taxons. This is in agreement with the existence of high
   phenotypic similarities between diploid and tetraploid cytotypes of P.
   procurrens, and among diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid
   cytotypes of P. simplex. Since the polyploid cytotypes of these species
   are reproduced by apomixis, the specific genetic clustering by ISSR
   markers and morphological and cytological results support the hypothesis
   that the two multiploid species were originated by autopolyploidy. Our
   results confirm previous studies suggesting a monophyletic origin for
   the subgenus Anachyris and are concordant with previous data regarding
   genomic homologies and phylogenetic analyses in the genus. (C) 2014

Title = {Putative Pacemakers in the Eyestalk and Brain of the Crayfish
   Procambarus clarkii Show Circadian Oscillations in Levels of mRNA
   for Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) synthesizing cells in the optic
   lobe, one of the pacemakers of the circadian system, have been shown to
   be present in crayfish. However, the presence of CHH in the central
   brain, another putative pacemaker of the multi-oscillatory circadian
   system, of this decapod and its circadian transcription in the optic
   lobe and brain have yet to be explored. Therefore, using qualitative and
   quantitative PCR, we isolated and cloned a CHH mRNA fragment from two
   putative pacemakers of the multi-oscillatory circadian system of
   Procambarus clarkii, the optic lobe and the central brain. This CHH
   transcript synchronized to daily light-dark cycles and oscillated under
   dark, constant conditions demonstrating statistically significant daily
   and circadian rhythms in both structures. Furthermore, to investigate
   the presence of the peptide in the central brain of this decapod, we
   used immunohistochemical methods. Confocal microscopy revealed the
   presence of CHH-IR in fibers and cells of the protocerebral and
   tritocerebal clusters and neuropiles, particularly in some neurons
   located in clusters 6, 14, 15 and 17. The presence of CHH positive
   neurons in structures of P. clarkii where clock proteins have been
   reported suggests a relationship between the circadian clockwork and
   CHH. This work provides new insights into the circadian regulation of
   CHH, a pleiotropic hormone that regulates many physiological processes
   such as glucose metabolism and osmoregulatory responses to stress.},

   the Logarithmic Shift Factor (LSF) with temperature that obeys the

Title = {Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) (Acari: Ixodidae), the
   Cayenne tick: phylogeography and evidence for allopatric speciation},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Background: Amblyomma cajennense F. is one of the best known and studied
   ticks in the New World because of its very wide distribution, its
   economical importance as pest of domestic ungulates, and its association
   with a variety of animal and human pathogens. Recent observations,
   however, have challenged the taxonomic status of this tick and indicated
   that intraspecific cryptic speciation might be occurring. In the present
   study, we investigate the evolutionary and demographic history of this
   tick and examine its genetic structure based on the analyses of three
   mitochondrial (12SrDNA, d-loop, and COII) and one nuclear (ITS2) genes.
   Because A. cajennense is characterized by a typical trans-Amazonian
   distribution, lineage divergence dating is also performed to establish
   whether genetic diversity can be linked to dated vicariant events which
   shaped the topology of the Neotropics.
   Results: Total evidence analyses of the concatenated mtDNA and nuclear +
   mtDNA datasets resulted in well-resolved and fully congruent
   reconstructions of the relationships within A. cajennense. The
   phylogenetic analyses consistently found A. cajennense to be
   monophyletic and to be separated into six genetic units defined by
   mutually exclusive haplotype compositions and habitat associations.
   Also, genetic divergence values showed that these lineages are as
   distinct from each other as recognized separate species of the same
   genus. The six clades are deeply split and node dating indicates that
   they started diverging in the middle-late Miocene.
   Conclusions: Behavioral differences and the results of laboratory
   cross-breeding experiments had already indicated that A. cajennense
   might be a complex of distinct taxonomic units. The combined and
   congruent mitochondrial and nuclear genetic evidence from this study
   reveals that A. cajennense is an assembly of six distinct species which
   have evolved separately from each other since at least 13.2 million
   years ago (Mya) in the earliest and 3.3 Mya in the latest lineages. The
   temporal and spatial diversification modes of the six lineages overlap
   the phylogeographical history of other organisms with similar extant
   trans-Amazonian distributions and are consistent with the present
   prevailing hypothesis that Neotropical diversity often finds its origins
   in the Miocene, after the Andean uplift changed the topology and
   consequently the climate and ecology of the Neotropics.},

Title = {Low complexity regions (LCRs) contribute to the hypervariability of the
   HIV-1 gp120 protein},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {338},
Pages = {80-86},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Low complexity regions (LCRs) are sequences of nucleic acids or proteins
   defined by a compositional bias. Their occurrence has been confirmed in
   sequences of the three cellular lineages (Bacteria, Archaea and
   Eucarya), and has also been reported in viral genomes. We present here
   the results of a detailed computer analysis of the LCRs present in the
   HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) encoded by the viral gene env. The
   analysis was performed using a sample of 3637 Env polyprotein sequences
   derived from 4117 completely sequenced and translated HIV-1 genomes
   available in public databases as of December 2012. We have identified
   1229 LCRs located in four different regions of the gp120 protein that
   correspond to four of the five regions that have been identified as
   hypervariable (V1, V2, V4 and V5). The remaining 29 LCRs are found in
   the signal peptide and in the conserved regions C2, C3, C4 and C5. No
   LCR has been identified in the hypervariable region V3. The LCRs
   detected in the V1, V2, V4, and V5 hypervariable regions exhibit a high
   Asn content in their amino acid composition, which very likely
   correspond to glycosylation sites, which may contribute to the
   retroviral ability to avoid the immune system. In sharp contrast with
   what is observed in gp120 proteins lacking LCRs, the glycosylation sites
   present in LCRs tend to be clustered towards the center of the region
   forming well-defined islands. The results presented here suggest that
   LCRs represent a hitherto undescribed source of genomic variability in
   lentivirus, and that these repeats may represent an important source of
   antigenic variation in HIV-1 populations. The results reported here may
   exemplify the evolutionary processes that may have increased the size of
   primitive cellular RNA genomes and the role of LCRs as a source of raw
   material during the processes of evolutionary acquisition of new
   functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this article we introduce an adaptive logic: LATA(r), which together
   with a contraction procedure RETRO and a way to distinguish kinds of
   premises (knowledge, hypotheses, observations), serves as a formal
   setting for hypotheses generation and testing in the empirical sciences,
   in our case medicine, more in particular, medical diagnosis en
   neurology. As any other adaptive logic, LATA(r) has a dynamic proof
   theory and allows for a line of a proof to be marked when it is found
   that it no longer observes the conditions under which it was obtained in
   the first place. In addition, our LATA(r) combines deductive and
   abductive steps in its dynamic proofs. Adaptive logics serve as a model
   for the contruction of diagnoses in neurology. As opposed to other
   abductive models, this one takes into account the fact that diagnostic
   hypotheses are both produced by an abductive rule and just by assertion,
   specially when a medical doctor aims at refuting a hypothesis.},

Title = {Pattern of chromosomal changes in `beta' Anolis (Norops group)
   (Squamata: Polychrotidae) depicted by an ancestral state analysis},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Neotropical lizards, genus Anolis (Polychrotidae), with
   nearly 380 species, are members of one of the most diversified genera
   among amniotes. Herein, we present an overview of chromosomal evolution
   in `beta' Anolis (Norops group) as a baseline for future studies of the
   karyotypic evolution of anoles. We evaluated all available information
   concerning karyotypes of Norops, including original data on a recently
   described species, Anolis unilobatus. We used the phylogeny of Norops
   based on DNA sequence data to infer the main pattern of chromosomal
   evolution by means of an ancestral state analysis (ASR).
   Results: We identified 11 different karyotypes, of which 9 in the
   species had so far been used in molecular studies. The ASR indicated
   that a change in the number of microchromosomes was the first
   evolutionary step, followed by an increase in chromosome numbers, likely
   due to centric fissions of macrochromosomes. The ASR also showed that in
   nine species, heteromorphic sex chromosomes most probably originated
   from six independent events.
   Conclusions: We observed an overall good correspondence of some
   characteristics of karyotypes and species relationships. Moreover, the
   clade seems prone to sex chromosome diversification, and the origins of
   five of these heteromorphic sex chromosome variants seem to be recent as
   they appear at the tip nodes in the ancestral character reconstruction.
   Karyotypic diversification in Norops provides an opportunity to test the
   chromosomal speciation models and is expected to be useful in studying
   relationships among anole species and in identifying cryptic taxa.},

Abstract = {In a 210d experiment, the potential of biofloc technology (BFT) was
   evaluated for Farfantepenaeus duorarum. Water quality parameters,
   microorganisms profile and proximate analysis of biofloc were also
   assessed. BFT did not improve the growth performance in F. duorarum when
   compared to conventional clear-water water exchange system (final weight
   and survival of 13.3 g and 63.2 \%; and 13.9 g and 81.4 \%,
   respectively). Microorganism assessment suggested a higher presence of
   filamentous cyanobacteria followed by protozoa, nematodes and copepods.
   Proximate analysis of biofloc showed crude protein and crude lipid means
   levels of 25 and 0.6 \%, respectively, and these values varied during
   the experiment. F. duorarum seemed to be susceptible to high stocking
   density and high levels of suspended solids (> 15 mL L-1).},

Abstract = {We consider the problem of whether a given spacetime admits a foliation
   by (n - 1)-umbilical spacelike hypersurfaces. We introduce the notion of
   a timelike closed partially conformal vector field in a spacetime and
   show that the existence of a vector field of this kind guarantees in
   turn the existence of that foliation. We then construct explicit
   examples of families of (n - 1)-umbilical spacelike hypersurfaces in the
   de Sitter space. Imposing the further condition of having constant r-th
   mean curvature, we give the complete description of any leaf of a
   foliation of the de Sitter space by these hypersurfaces. Finally, in a
   spacetime foliated by (n - 1)-umbilical spacelike hypersurfaces we
   characterize the immersed spacelike hypersurfaces which are (n -
   1)-umbilical.},

Abstract = {We describe the external morphology, buccal cavity, chondrocranium,

   achavali (Achaval's Toad), along with its karyotype. Tadpoles were found
   in a small, permanent stream and were showing schooling behavior. The
   characterization of the proposed species groups within Rhinella cannot
   be currently improved using external larval morphology, as it seems to
   be much conserved within this genus. Buccal cavity morphology confirms
   the distinctiveness of the Rhinella veraguensis (Veragua Toad) group
   with respect to other known Rhinella. Musculoskeletal character states
   are similar among bufonids, although within this family the basal genus
   Melanophryniscus shows some distinctive states. The karyotype is
   composed of 22 bi-armed chromosomes, with secondary constrictions in
   pair 7, as found in the other species in the Rhinella marina (Marine
   Toad) group.},

Abstract = {The thermodynamics of Maxwell-Dilaton black holes has been extensively
   studied. It has served as a fertile ground to test ideas about
   temperature through various definitions of surface gravity. In this
   paper, we make an independent analysis of this black hole solution in
   both, Einstein and Jordan, frames. We explore a set of definitions for
   the surface gravity and observe the different predictions they make for
   the near extremal configuration of this black hole. Finally, motivated
   by the singularity structure in the interior of the event horizon, we
   use a holographic argument to remove the micro-states from the
   disconnected region of this solution. In this manner, we construct a
   frame independent entropy from which we obtain a temperature which
   agrees with the standard results in the non-extremal regime, and has a
   desirable behaviour around the extremal configurations according to the
   third law of black hole mechanics.},

Abstract = {Although exotic plant invasions are one of the most important components
   of global change, previous studies have found some of the alien species
   to provide resources and/or conditions to native biota. One example of
   this is the saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima). This exotic invasive tree
   has been related to several dramatic environmental changes in North
   America. However, previous studies suggest that they offer resources and
   conditions for native biota, such as the threatened southwestern willow
   flycatcher (Empidonax traillii). In this study, we surveyed avian
   communities and bird nests at sites severely invaded by saltcedars,
   moderately invaded sites, and non-invaded sites in northwestern Mexico.
   Our results show that although bird species richness and abundances do
   not differ among the studied conditions, species composition did. Also,
   bird nest density differed among the studied conditions, with
   non-invaded sites having the highest functional diversity of nesting
   birds. We suggest that future studies should gather natural history and
   ecological information that allows managing this invasive species
   correctly both in the USA and Mexico.},

Title = {Predicting the potential distribution of Vexillata (Nematoda:

Abstract = {Species distribution modelling has been a powerful tool to explore the
   potential distribution of parasites in wildlife, being the basis of
   studies on biogeography. Vexillata spp. are intestinal nematodes found
   in several species of mammalian hosts, such as rodents (Geomyoidea) and
   hares (Leporidae) in the Nearctic and northern Neotropical regions. In
   the present study, we modelled the potential distribution of Vexillata
   spp. and their hosts, using exclusively species from the Geomyidae and
   Heteromyidae families, in order to identify their distributional
   patterns. Bioclimatic and topographic variables were used to identify
   and predict suitable habitats for Vexillata and its hosts. Using these
   models, we identified that temperature seasonality is a significant
   environmental factor that influences the distribution of the parasite
   genus and its host. In particular, the geographical distribution is
   estimated to be larger than that predicted for its hosts. This suggests
   that the nematode has the potential to extend its geographical range and
   also its spectrum of host species. Increasing sample size and
   geographical coverage will contribute to recommendations for
   conservation of this host-parasite system.},

Abstract = {Forest structure and composition have been used to assess the habitat
   characteristics that determine bird distributions. The patterns of
   distribution have been shaped by historical and ecological factors that
   play different roles at both temporal and spatial scales. The objectives
   of this research were to characterize the habitat of the endangered
   Military Macaw (Ara militaris) and evaluate the potential distribution
   of this species based on trends of land use changes in Mexico. We
   characterized the community structure and floristic composition of 8
   forests that are currently used by the Military Macaw for breeding and
   feeding and compared the results with 6 similar forests characterized in
   other studies but without historical records of the presence of the
   Military Macaw. The Military Macaw preferred sites with high diversity
   of plant species dominated by trees from 4 to 15 m in height and from 5
   to 90 cm in diameter at breast height. We identified 236 plant species
   in the 8 forests with 20 species (8.4\%) used for nesting and feeding by
   the Military Macaw. The floristic composition is important for the
   presence of the Military Macaw because there were significant
   differences between forests with and without its presence. The potential
   area of distribution of the Military Macaw had decreased by 32\% and the
   remnant areas are included in only 8 National Protected Areas. The
   protected areas of natural forests should be increased to preserve the
   sites of potential distribution and consequently the habitat of the
   Military Macaw in Mexico.},

   Queretaro State, Mexico, present circadian rhythms of locomotor activity
   in free running, and light-dark cycles induce a notable change in
   circadian period, suggesting an entraining of the locomotor activity
   rhythm. We discuss the existence of remnant circadian photoreceptors in
   a nonphotic environment, but also that nonphotic zeitgebers may entrain
   circadian activity of the fauna inside the cave.},

Abstract = {The recent demand for live seafood has made Lithodes santolla a
   potential candidate for the live crab market Since live transport
   implies long aerial exposure times, the present study determined the
   tolerance of L santolla to aerial exposure and also explored the
   physiological status of L santolla after six different aerial exposure
   times: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 h. No mortalities were recorded during
   emersion periods shorter than 40 h, however, all hemolymph parameters
   were modulated by aerial exposure. Hemolymph dissolved oxygen and pH
   were inversely related with the aerial exposure time (-0.016 mg L-1
   h(-1) and -0.018 h(-1), respectively), while oxyhemocyanin and hemolymph
   protein were positively correlated (0.006 mmol L-1 h(-1) and 0.487 mg
   mL(-1) h(-1), respectively). Oxygen consumption at re-immersion was
   affected by aerial exposure time, with low values in animals emersed for
   longer than 30 h. We postulate that the unexpected high tolerance of L.
   santolla to aerial exposure is mainly related to adaptations to hypoxia,
   developed to overcome hypoxic events in their natural environment in
   deep water. The present findings are not only important for
   understanding L. santolla's physiology, but also provide the first
   evaluation of the potential marketing of southern king crab as live
   seafood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Diversity of marine fungi in the Gulf of Mexico remains unknown for the
   most part, therefore the geographical distribution patterns of these
   microorganisms are mostly unknown too. Twelve sandy beaches located in
   this sea were sampled to evaluate the diversity of marine fungi,
   revealed by fruiting on natural substrata incubated in the laboratory
   for up to 12 months. Species richness and diversity differed between
   beaches, and corresponded with the presence of main and highly polluted
   river mouths; nearshore marine environments, and core industrial and
   port developments. Contaminants and local anthropogenic activities may
   be reducing the diversity of marine ascomycetes. Connections between
   beaches and different nearshore habitats explain the high diversity
   observed, since they represent a varied source of substrata for
   decomposition and heterogeneous environmental conditions. We recognized
   four main local species distribution patterns. Moreover, the constrained
   correspondence analysis showed that temperature is a major environmental
   variable affecting the distribution of these fungi. By a linear
   regression we showed a significant relationship between temperature and
   diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Abstract = {Let D = (V(D),A(D)) be a digraph and k >= 2 an integer. We say that D is
   k-quasi-transitive if for every directed path (v(0), v(1), ..., v(k)) in
   D we have (v(0), v(k)) is an element of A(D) or (v(k), v(0)) is an
   element of A(D). Clearly, a 2-quasi-transitive digraph is a
   quasi-transitive digraph in the usual sense.
   Bang-Jensen and Gutin proved that a quasi-transitive digraph D has a
   3-king if and only if D has a unique initial strong component, and if D
   has a 3-king and the unique initial strong component of D has at least
   three vertices, then D has at least three 3-kings. In this paper we
   prove the following generalization: a k-quasi-transitive digraph D has a
   (k + 1)-king if and only if D has a unique initial strong component, and
   if D has a (k + 1)-king, then either all the vertices of the unique
   initial strong components are (k + 1)-kings or the number of (k +
   1)-kings in D is at least (k + 2). Also, we obtain new results on the
   minimum number of 3-kings in quasi-transitive digraphs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This paper studies a reaction-diffusion-chemotaxis model for bacterial
   aggregation patterns on the surface of thin agar plates. It is based on
   the non-linear degenerate cross diffusion model proposed by Kawasaki et
   al. (1997) {[}5] and it includes a suitable nutrient chemotactic term
   compatible with such type of diffusion, as suggested by Ben-Jacob et al.
   (2000) {[}20]. An asymptotic estimation predicts the growth velocity of
   the colony envelope as a function of both the nutrient concentration and
   the chemotactic sensitivity. It is shown that the growth velocity is an
   increasing function of the chemotactic sensitivity. High resolution
   numerical simulations using Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which
   include noise in the diffusion coefficient for the bacteria, are
   presented. The numerical results verify that the chemotactic term
   enhances the velocity of propagation of the colony envelope. In
   addition, the chemotaxis seems to stabilize the formation of branches in
   the soft-agar, low-nutrient regime. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In the present article we propose an explicitly covariant formulation of
   several energy-momentum-stress balance equations, involving different
   force densities, deduced from the macroscopic Maxwell equations. These
   force densities depend on how Maxwell's equations are written in terms
   of the electromagnetic fields E, H, D, and B, and the polarizations P
   and M. We find that several energy-momentum-stress tensors are involved
   in these balance equations. The three tensors implied by these balance
   equations result symmetrical. In this way the old A-M controversy can be
   seen under a new light.},

Abstract = {We studied testate amoebae (testates) in the soils of coniferous and
   deciduous forests and in the wetland and aquatic habitats of Mexico. In
   141 samples we found 205 taxa identified to the species or intraspecies
   level and 68 testate amoebae, which could not be identified to the
   species level. The highest species diversity of testates was found in
   the soils of the tropical rainforest (126 species and intraspecific
   taxa, including spp.) and in tropical wetlands (144 species and
   intraspecific taxa, including spp.). The study documented testate
   amoebae with a limited geographical distribution (genera Centropyxis,
   Cornuapyxis, Ellipsopyxis, Hoogenraadia, Planhoogenraadia, Apolimia,
   Certesella, Apodera, and Alocodera). We found that testate amoebae in
   the soils of Mexico had a high level of polymorphism and individual
   variability. We discuss the value of soil testate amoebae for defining
   biogeographical regions of Mexico.},

Abstract = {Green macroalgal blooms are becoming a common problem in coastal waters
   and estuaries. This study describes the first occurrence of a persistent
   macroalgal bloom of the genus Anadyomene J.V. Lamouroux (Cladophorales,
   Anadyomenaceae) in the world and particularly in Biscayne Bay, FL, USA.
   The morphological-based identification of species was verified by a
   molecular analysis that sequenced the variable C1D2 region of the large
   subunit (LSU) nrDNA. Results indicate that the bloom is composed of two
   species: Anadyomene stellata, reported previously for Florida, and a
   diminutive perforate undetermined species, Anadyomene sp., potentially
   representing an introduction in the area. General surveys in Biscayne
   Bay based on a stratified random design, to visually estimate the
   percent cover of submerged aquatic vegetation, date from 1999; using the
   same methods recent intensive surveys of the detected bloom were
   conducted once a year from 2010 to 2012. Results show that the
   Anadyomene bloom densities have persisted since 2005 through 2012
   covering an area of approximately 60 km(2) of seagrass habitats. The
   spatial distribution of the bloom is restricted to the central inshore
   section of the Bay, an area affected by canals and groundwater
   discharges. The persistent 75\% cover reported for several sites, has
   caused significant negative impacts to seagrass beds. This bloom
   occurring adjacent to metropolitan Miami, adds to the world trend of
   increasing green macroalgal blooms occurring at enriched coastal waters.

Abstract = {The Isthmus of Tehuantepec has played an important role in shaping the
   avian diversity of Mexico, as well as the rest of the Western
   Hemisphere. It has been both a barrier and a land connector between
   North and South America for many groups of birds. Furthermore, climatic
   change over the Pleistocene has resulted in ecological fluctuations that
   led to periods of connection and isolation of the highlands in this
   area. Here we studied the divergence of two species of orioles whose
   distribution in the highlands is separated by the lowlands of the
   Isthmus of Tehuantepec: Icterus graduacauda (west of the Isthmus) and
   Icterus chrysater (east of the Isthmus). We sequenced multiple loci (one
   mitochondrial gene and six nuclear introns) and performed coalescent
   analyses (Isolation with Migration) to test whether their divergence
   resulted from prior occupancy of the ancestral area followed by a
   vicariant event or recent dispersal from one side or the other of this
   Isthmus. Results strongly indicate a vicariant event roughly
   300,000years ago in the Pleistocene followed by little or no gene flow.
   Both mitochondrial and nuclear genes show that the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec is a strong barrier to gene flow. Thus, these two species
   appear to not exchange genes despite their recent divergence and the
   close geographic proximity of their ranges.},

Abstract = {Exposure to thermal stress was shown to have a significant effect on the
   osmotic pressure of the hemolymph, glucose levels, total count of
   hemocyte (TCH), and proPO activity in adult white shrimp Litopenaeus
   vannamei. Exposure of the shrimp to CTMax significantly increased the
   osmotic pressure of the hemolymph relative to the control group. In
   organisms reaching CTMax, temperature elicited a secondary stress
   response that included an increase in hemolymph glucose of 31mgmL(1).
   Metabolites in hemolymph such as cholesterol, acylglycerides, and total
   protein were not significantly affected by exposure to CTMax. CTMax
   exposure affected several immunological parameters causing decreases in
   TCH and proPO activity. We suggested that biomarkers such as osmolality,
   glucose levels, TCH, and proPO activity could be used as sensitive
   predictors of exposure to CTMax in white shrimp.},

Abstract = {Since the 19th Century, two regions have been recognized for North
   American mammals, which overlap in Mexico. The Nearctic region
   corresponds to the northern areas and the Neotropical region corresponds
   to the southern ones. There are no recent regionalizations for these
   regions under the criterion of endemism. In the present study, we
   integrate two methods to regionalize North America, using species
   distribution models of mammals: endemicity analysis (EA) and parsimony
   analysis of endemicity (PAE). EA was used to obtain areas of endemism
   and PAE was used to hierarchize them. We found 76 consensus areas from
   329 sets classified in 146 cladograms, and the strict consensus
   cladogram shows a basal polytomy with 14 areas and 16 clades. The final
   regionalization recognizes two regions (Nearctic and Neotropical) and a
   transition zone (Mexican Transition Zone), six subregions (Canadian,
   Alleghanian, Californian-Rocky Mountain, Pacific Central America,
   Mexican Gulf-Central America, and Central America), two dominions
   (Californian and Rocky Mountain), and 23 provinces. Our analysis show
   that North America is probably more complex than previously assumed.(c)

Abstract = {The Mixteca Alta Oaxaquena is in the state of Oaxaca, southern Mexico.
   This region is characterized by numerous Pleistocene fossiliferous
   localities. The objective of this study is to describe a diverse
   assemblage of Late Pleistocene freshwater and terrestrial mollusks in
   two localities from northeastern Oaxaca, Coixtlahuaca District. We
   identified 10 taxa of gastropods and one of bivalves. By the
   sedimentological characteristics and the mollusks assemblage, it is
   possible to relate the first locality with meandriform river deposits,
   without vegetation. The second locality was associated with a fioodplain
   with short-lived associated vegetation. Five identified species
   constitute the most austral records of these taxa in Neartic Realm. In
   all the taxa, the Late Pleistocene occurrences constitute the last
   records of the identified mollusks in the study zone. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Agaric fungi of the southern Appalachian Mountains including Great Smoky
   Mountains National Park are often heterozygous for the rDNA internal
   transcribed spacer region (ITS) with >42\% of collections showing some
   heterozygosity for indels and/or base-pair substitutions. For these
   collections, intra-individual haplotype divergence is typically less
   than 2\%, but for 3\% of these collections intraindividual haplotype
   divergence exceeds that figure. We hypothesize that high
   intra-individual haplotype divergence is due to hybridization between
   agaric fungi with divergent haplotypes, possibly migrants from
   geographically isolated glacial refugia. Four species with relatively
   high haplotype divergence were examined: Armillaria mellea, Amanita
   citrina f. lavendula, Gymnopus dichrous and the Hygrocybe flavescens/
   chlorophana complex. The ITS region was sequenced, haplotypes of
   heterozygotes were resolved through cloning, and phylogenetic analyses
   were used to determine the outcome of hybridization events. Within
   Armillaria mellea and Amanita citrina f. lavendula, we found evidence of
   interbreeding and recombination. Within G. dichrous and H. flavescens/
   chlorophana, hybrids were identified but there was no evidence for F-2
   or higher progeny in natural populations suggesting that the hybrid
   fruitbodies might be an evolutionary dead end and that the genetically
   divergent Mendelian populations from which they were derived are, in
   fact, different species. The association between ITS haplotype
   divergence of less than 5\% (Armillaria mellea = 2.6\% excluding gaps;
   Amanita citrina f. lavendula = 3.3\%) with the presence of putative
   recombinants and greater than 5\% (Gymnopus dichrous = 5.7\%; Hygrogbe
   flavescens/ chlorophana = 14.1\%) with apparent failure of F-1 hybrids
   to produce F-2 or higher progeny in populations may suggest a

Abstract = {Natural hybridization frequently promotes gene introgression among
   closely related species in sympatric populations, producing complex
   patterns of morphological variation. Therefore, a detailed understanding
   of the dynamics of interspecific gene flow and its morphological
   patterns is of widespread interest. We tested if introgressive
   hybridization promotes an increase in transgressive characters in
   comparison with the parental species. A sunflower species complex
   occurring in Mexico formed by two native invasive species, Tithonia
   tubaeformis and Tithonia rotundifolia, was analyzed using 46
   morphological characters (leaf, flower and fruit) in five hybrid zones
   (N = 150 individuals) and two pure sites for each parental species (N =
   80 individuals). In general, T. tubaeformis differed significantly from
   T. rotundifolia in all the examined characters, except six foliar and
   one inflorescence character. Morphological characters support the
   hypothesis of hybridization in this complex, even though both species
   remain morphological distinct in mixed stands. Individual hybrids appear
   to be a mosaic of parent-like (24.8 \% of traits), intermediate (26.1
   \%) and transgressive (37.8 \%) phenotypes (the remaining 11.3 \% of the
   traits did not differ significantly from both parental species). Our
   results suggest that individuals from the same parental species were
   more similar among themselves than to putative hybrids, indicating
   occasional hybridization with segregation in hybrid types or
   backcrossing to parents. Evidence indicates a unidirectional pattern of
   gene flow toward T. rotundifolia.},

   During each driving period, the fluid that leaves the channel forms a
   coherent structure consisting of a pair of counter-rotating vortices,
   also known as a dipole. Dipole features, such as speed, intensity, and
   stability, depend on two dimensionless parameters: the Strouhal number
   and the Reynolds number. In some cases the dipole lifetime is greater
   than the driving period, so vortices may interact and even coalesce. The
   second part of the paper is devoted to calculating solid-particle
   trajectories immersed in this flow. For this purpose an equation deduced
   from first principles is solved considering drag, added mass, and
   history forces. We find that solid particles accumulate in certain
   regions and that a fraction of the particles leave the integration
   domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an ageing-related lung disorder
   characterised by expansion of the myofibroblast population and aberrant
   lung remodelling. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid pro-hormone,
   decreases with age but an exaggerated decline has been associated with
   chronic degenerative diseases.
   We quantified the plasma levels of DHEA and its sulfated form (DHEA-S)
   in 137 IPF patients and 58 controls and examined the effects of DHEA on
   human lung fibroblasts.
   Plasma DHEA/DHEA-S was significantly decreased in male IPF patients
   (median (range) DHEA: 4.4 (0.2-29.2) versus 6.7 (2.1-15.2) ng.mL(-1),
   p<0.01; DHEA-S: 47 (15.0-211) versus 85.2 (37.6-247.0) mu g.dL(-1),
   p<0.001), while in females only DHEA-S was significantly decreased (32.6
   (15.0-303.0) versus 68.3 (16.4-171) mu g.d.L-1, p<0.001). DHEA caused a
   decrease in fibroblast proliferation and an approximately two-fold
   increase in fibroblast apoptosis, probably through the intrinsic pathway
   with activation of caspase-9. This effect was accompanied by
   upregulation of several pro-apoptotic proteins (Ban and cyclin-dependent
   kinase-inhibitor CDNK1A) and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins,
   such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (c-IAP)1 and c-IAP2. DHEA also
   caused a significant decrease of transforming growth factor-beta
   1-induced collagen production and fibroblast to myofibroblast
   differentiation, and inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced
   fibroblast migration.
   These findings demonstrate a disproportionate decrease of DHEA/DHEA-S in
   IPF patients and indicate that this molecule has multiple antifibrotic
   properties.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the effects on the electrical conductivity
   originated by the inclusion of Fano defects (FDs) for periodic and
   quasiperiodic systems of macroscopic size. This study is developed using
   the extension of the methods of renormalization for the Kubo-Greenwood
   formula in real space within the tight-binding formalism. Within this
   formalism, the conductivity is determined in an exact form, without any
   other approximation. For periodic systems, we find the zeros of
   conductivity located at the eigenenergies of the coupled chain of N-F
   atoms, and transparent states at the eigenenergies of a chain of N-F - 1
   atoms. These results are shown in both numerical and analytical way.
   Moreover, the position of the FD in the system does not alter the
   conductivity spectrum. On the other hand, for quasiperiodic systems,
   only some coupled chains preserve the transparent state; this was found
   both numerically and analytically. The case of two FDs attached to the
   system is also analyzed, founding a high dependence of the electrical
   conductivity on the distance between the FDs. Finally, this study is
   extended to two dimensions. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {449},

Abstract = {Octopus hard structures have recently been used as ageing tools.
   Thirty-two Octopus maya were raised in captivity in four age groups,
   ranging from 124 to 233 days old. Their stylets, beaks and eye lenses
   were analyzed in order to validate the periodicity of growth increments
   during all the octopus life. Transverse sections of stylets were mounted
   in glycerin jelly, beaks were sagitally cut to analyze their lateral
   walls and eye lenses were processed by histological techniques and
   mounted in resin. Growth increments in each structure were observed and
   counted under a microscope. Stylet increments were successfully
   validated as their counts were closely related to age in days. Beak
   increments from the two younger age groups showed a close relationship
   with age, suggesting a daily deposition. However, persistence of lower
   increment counts strongly suggests that not all growth increments could
   be counted, probably due to erosion during feeding. Eye lens increment
   counts did not show a relation with age, although periodicity, if any,
   might be subdaily. The use of stylets is recommended for O. maya growth
   and ageing studies as they also showed a high precision in increment
   counts between readers. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To understand the particular evolutionary patterns of plant genomes,
   there is a need to systematically survey the fate of the subgenomes of
   polyploids fixed as whole genome duplicates, including patterns of
   retention of duplicate, triplicate, etc. genes.
   Results: We measure the simultaneous dynamics of duplicate orthologous
   gene loss in rosids, in asterids, and in monocots, as influenced by
   biological functional class. This pan-angiosperm view confirms common
   tendencies and consistency through time for both ancient and more recent
   whole genome polyploidization events.
   Conclusions: The gene loss analysis represents an assessment of
   post-polyploidization evolution, at the level of individual gene
   families within and across sister genomes. Functional analysis confirms
   universal trends previously reported for more recent plant polyploidy
   events: genes involved with regulation and responses were retained in
   multiple copies, while genes involved with metabolic and catalytic
   processes tended to lose copies, across all three groups of plants.},

Title = {Thermohaline processes in a tropical coastal zone},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {101-109},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The detailed thermohaline structure of the northern Yucatan coastal zone
   was obtained for the first time in order to gain an insight into the
   interactions between various processes in this complex tropical
   environment of extreme evaporation and high precipitation rates. From
   the continent, it has water exchange with numerous coastal lagoons
   (ranging from brackish to hypersaline) and receives intense submarine
   groundwater discharges (SGD). In the summer of 2006 a high-resolution
   (500 m cross-shore and 5 km along-shore) oceanographic campaign was
   performed starting at Holbox Island down to the mouth of Celestun
   Lagoon. CTD profiles were measured at 1020 stations along 69 coastal
   cross-shore transects. Additionally, CTD data from 2 wider surveys,
   covering the continental shelf (Campeche Bank) and the southern Gulf of
   Mexico respectively were used to complement the results. From the
   thermohaline properties, two main water masses were identified: (a) the
   Caribbean Subtropical Underwater (CSUW), upwelled from the Caribbean,
   which was observed at the bottom very close to the coast in more than
   260 km (from the upwelling region near Cape Catoche to approximately
   89.5 W during the summer of 2006) and (b) the second dominant group was
   a mass of warm hypersaline water which originates in Yucatan due to the
   high temperature and evaporation rates. We call this water mass the
   Yucatan Sea Water (YSW) after finding evidence of its presence in
   various field campaigns both in the Yucatan Sea and further to the west
   in the southern Gulf of Mexico. All the water masses present in the
   Yucatan coastal zone showed pronounced variations with important
   dilution and salinisation effects. The permeable karstic geology of the
   region prevents the continental water from discharging into the ocean
   through surface rivers and instead the rainfall permeates directly to
   the aquifer and travels through caves and fractures towards the sea.
   Three main regions showed evidence of continental discharges from the
   coast: the central eastern region (similar to 21.6 N, 87.75 W), around
   Dzilam Bravo (similar to 21.4 N, 89 W) and, to a lesser degree, the
   western region of the coast (similar to 21.1 N, 90.3 W). The latter two
   regions are the eastern and western intersections of the Chicxulub
   crater ring with the coast respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Interculturality: Inclusion and Exclusion in the Policy of Diversity
   Management in Barcelona},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2013},
Number = {57},
Pages = {123+},

Abstract = {This text is about the operation of the policy of interculturality which
   currently exists in the City of Barcelona, Spain. It is presented the
   institutional proposal of the intercultural model of the Catalan
   municipality, which represents with any doubt, one of the most advanced
   proposals of attention to the problematic of the diversity management of
   the multicultural societies in the contemporary world. It is exposed the
   strategies used to carry out the process of social inclusion of the
   immigrant population.
   To evaluate the model, the voices of the different actors are recovered,
   such as: public officials, scholars, consultants, members of the social
   and civil organizations. Through a thorough exploration of this
   phenomenon, it is possible to observe territorial, social and
   institutional importance of the intercultural model as well as the
   leading proposal concerning the building of a plural citizenry which
   through inclusion hopes to form community, but paying attention to the
   diversity. At the same time are highlighted the exact limits involved in
   the intercultural model, as the lack of political rights; and other
   concurrent factors, like the economic crisis.
   Secondly, it is noted a strong limitation due to the coexistence, in the
   operation of this policy, of two institutional regulations: at the
   municipal and state levels, which do not coincide in the orientation of
   that policy and sometimes its application is contradictory within the
   urban reality. The state scope responds to the hegemonic immigration
   policy of the European Union which is harassing and tends to exclude,
   whereas in the municipal scope in Barcelona, it exercises a policy
   oriented to the inclusion. Finally, seine challenges to put into
   practice this policy are mentioned. For example, the economic dependency
   to carry it out and the political willingness of the government
   officials to overcome the limits presented by the model itself and those
   imposed by the political and economic environment.},

Abstract = {The properties of molybdenum trioxide (20 nm)/silver (x nm)/molybdenum
   trioxide (35 nm) multilayer structures, deposited by simple vacuum
   evaporation, depend significantly on the deposition rate and on the
   thickness of the silver layer. If the presence of a commutation from an
   insulating state to a highly conductive state in these structures is
   usual, we show that, the thickness of the layer of Ag corresponding to
   the percolation of the metal paths, decreases from 8 nm to 4 nm when the
   Ag deposition rate increases from 0.2 nm/s to 0.4 nm/s. The transmission
   being optimum at 10-11 nm, the calculation of the factor of merit shows
   that the best structures are obtained for silver films approx. 10 nm
   thick deposited at a rate between 0.3 nm/s and 0.4 nm/s. When the
   optimal structures MoO3/Ag/MoO3 are used as anode in planar organic
   solar cells anode/Cul/CuPc/C-60/Alq3/Al they allow achieving power
   conversion efficiency of the same order of magnitude than that achieved
   by reference cells using ITO as anode. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Ability of Matrix Models to Explain the Past and Predict the Future of
   Plant Populations},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Uncertainty associated with ecological forecasts has long been
   recognized, but forecast accuracy is rarely quantified. We evaluated how
   well data on 82 populations of 20 species of plants spanning 3
   continents explained and predicted plant population dynamics. We
   parameterized stage-based matrix models with demographic data from
   individually marked plants and determined how well these models forecast
   population sizes observed at least 5 years into the future. Simple
   demographic models forecasted population dynamics poorly; only 40\% of
   observed population sizes fell within our forecasts' 95\% confidence
   limits. However, these models explained population dynamics during the
   years in which data were collected; observed changes in population size
   during the data-collection period were strongly positively correlated
   with population growth rate. Thus, these models are at least a sound way
   to quantify population status. Poor forecasts were not associated with
   the number of individual plants or years of data. We tested whether
   vital rates were density dependent and found both positive and negative
   density dependence. However, density dependence was not associated with
   forecast error. Forecast error was significantly associated with
   environmental differences between the data collection and forecast
   periods. To forecast population fates, more detailed models, such as
   those that project how environments are likely to change and how these
   changes will affect population dynamics, may be needed. Such detailed
   models are not always feasible. Thus, it may be wiser to make
   risk-averse decisions than to expect precise forecasts from models.
   Habilidad de los Modelos Matriciales para Explicar el Pasado y Predecir
   el Futuro de las Poblaciones de Plantas
   Resumen La incertidumbre asociada con el pronostico ecologico ha sido
   reconocida durante un largo tiempo pero rara vez se cuantifica su
   seguridad. Evaluamos que tan bien la informacion de 82 poblaciones de 20
   especies de plantas a lo largo de 3 continentes explica y predice la
   dinamica de poblacion de las plantas. Realizamos parametros con modelos
   matriciales con base en estadios con datos demograficos a partir de
   plantas marcadas individualmente y determinamos que tan bien estos
   modelos pronostican el tamano de las poblaciones al menos 5 anos en el
   futuro. Los modelos demograficos simples pronosticaron pobremente las
   dinamicas de poblacion; solamente el 40\% de las poblaciones observadas
   cayo dentro de los limites de confianza de 85\% de nuestros pronosticos.
   Estos modelos sin embargo explicaron la dinamica de poblacion a lo largo
   de los anos en los que se colectaron datos; los cambios observados en el
   tamano de la poblacion durante el periodo de colecta de datos estuvieron
   positivamente correlacionados con la tasa de crecimiento de la
   poblacion. Asi, estos modelos son por lo menos una manera segura de
   cuantificar el estado de la poblacion. Los pronosticos debiles no
   estuvieron asociados con el numero de plantas individuales o con los
   anos de datos. Probamos si las tasas vitales dependian de la densidad y
   encontramos que existe dependencia hacia la densidad tanto positiva como
   negativa, sin embargo la dependencia de densidad no se asocio con el
   error de pronostico. El error de pronostico estuvo significativamente
   asociado con diferencias ambientales entre la recoleccion de datos y los
   periodos de pronostico. Para predecir el destino de las poblaciones se
   necesitan modelos mas detallados, como aquellos que proyectan los
   cambios probables en el ambiente y como estos cambios afectaran a la
   dinamica de las poblaciones. Tales modelos tan detallados no siempre son
   factibles. Por ello puede ser mejor tomar decisiones aversas a riesgos
   que esperar pronosticos precisos de los modelos.},

Abstract = {A 40-day trial was performed to evaluate the effect of short-term
   natural fresh food (FF) supplementation 20 days prior to ablation in
   Litopenaeus vannamei broodstock raised under biofloc conditions. Changes
   in biochemical composition and fatty acids profile were used as
   indicators of nutritional condition. Females that received FF
   supplementation (FLOC + FF) achieved better eggs production, spawned
   more promptly, and presented higher levels of HUFA in eggs as compared
   to those that did not received FF (FLOC). Proximate analysis of biofloc
   and microorganisms assessment showed a higher crude protein and lipid
   content in the FLOC + FF treatment (26.3 and 0.7 \%) compared to FLOC
   treatment (18.4 and 0.3 \%) and also demonstrated a higher concentration
   of filamentous cyanobacteria and nematodes. The better outcomes obtained
   in females that received short-term FF supplementation justified the FF
   use in L. vannamei broodstock.},

Title = {Protein and amino acid composition from the mantle of juvenile
   Octopus vulgaris exposed to prolonged starvation},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1741-1751},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Protein and amino acid composition of the mantle of juvenile Octopus
   vulgaris (Cuvier, 1797) during fasting for 27days were determined.
   Average protein content of octopus mantle was of 711.19 +/-
   46.80gkg(-1)DW, and it decreased with increasing fasting days. The
   non-essential amino acids content was higher (486.18 +/- 11.08gkg(-1)
   protein) than essential amino acids (425.82 +/- 9.15gkg(-1) protein) at
   the start of the experiment (unstarved animals). The results suggest
   that the amino acid profile of the mantle where the most abundant amino
   acids are Arg, His, Lys, Gly, Leu and Pro could indicate a prolonged
   fasting condition (>20days) or poor nutrition of O. vulgaris. This study
   supports the idea of using mantle for metabolic needs of starved O.
   vulgaris suggesting that the degradation pathway of amino acids to
   pyruvate and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates was favoured
   contrary to the degradation pathway of ketogenic amino acids. Special
   considerations should be taken concerning Thr, Ile, Ser, Ala, Asx (Asp,
   Asn), Glx (Glu, Gln) (because of their fast intake) and Lys and His (due
   to their stable contents) during a prolonged period of fasting.},

Journal = {PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {493},
Pages = {85-88},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) formalism of
   superconductivity hinges on three separate new ingredients: (a)
   treatment of Cooper pairs as real bosons, (b) inclusion of two-hole
   pairs on an equal footing with two-electron ones, and (c) inclusion in
   the resulting ternary ideal boson-fermion gas of boson-fermion vertex
   interactions that drive formation/disin-tegration processes. Besides
   subsuming both BCS and BEC theories as well as the well-known crossover
   picture as special cases, GBEC leads to several-order-of-magnitude
   enhancement in the critical superconducting temperature T-c.
   The crossover picture is applicable also to ultracold atomic clouds,
   both bosonic and fermionic. But low-density expansions involving the
   interatomic scattering length a diverge term-by-term around the
   so-called unitary zone about the Feshbach resonance. However, expanding
   a in powers of the attractive part of the interatomic potential renders
   smooth, divergence-free low-density expansions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The unfolding dynamics of a flexible hairpin polymer inserted in a
   square nanochannel is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations of the
   bead-spring model. Because the hairpin polymer is not an equilibrium
   configuration, the molecule starts unfolding until it reaches a
   stretched configuration inside the tube. We study the effect of varying
   the channel height and width D, and the number of monomers N in the
   folded arm on the unfolding times. We show that for square nanochannels,
   the unfolding time scales as DN2, for small values of D. The unfolding
   relaxation dynamics obeys similar mechanisms described in the escaping
   dynamics of partially inserted polymers in cylindrical nanotubes. We
   also show that the velocity of the polymer center of mass scales as D-1,
   in agreement with DNA unfolding experiments in solid-state nanochannels
   and recent computational simulations. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Sadi Carnot in his seminal work of 1824 Reflections on the Motive Power
   of Fire (Dover, 1988) developed the theory Of the thermal motors,
   showing that the most efficient use of heat energy is achieved by a
   motor functioning reversibly between a hot furnace at temperature T-1
   and a condenser at temperature T-2 with efficiency eta(max) = 1 -
   (T-2/T-1). In his book Carnot sets the basis for the second law of
   thermodynamics, but also opens the way to study the maximum efficiency
   of other thermal devices like heat pumps, refrigerators, etc. Based on a
   previous work {[}4] here it is shown that Carnot's results for thermal
   devices can be extended to all other sorts of thermodynamical
   apparatuses like air pumps and wind generators, as well as to any other
   functioning device between a ``furnace{''} at high Y-1 and a
   ``condenser{''} at low T-2, where Y is any intensive thermodynamical
   variable. Then eta(max) = 1 - Y-2/Y-1 sets the norm for the achievement
   of an efficient use of energy by these generalized means.},

Abstract = {A detailed analysis of the change in the patterns of energy use in a
   Mexican village, from the year 1986 to 2012 is presented. The
   satisfaction of energy needs is analyzed according to the first- and
   second-law efficiencies of thermodynamics, for a total of 22 end-uses.
   The analysis covers both the end-use devices used for energy conversion
   and the energy and exergy used in the related thermodynamical tasks. The
   final energy per capita was 11.0 GJ/year in 2012, about 10\% less than
   in 1986. In the study period, the overall first-law efficiency of the
   community increased from 17\% to 23\%, while the second-law efficiency
   rose from 6.4\% to 8.2\%. The increments in useful energy and minimum
   exergy (total and per capita), relative to 1986, occur at the expense of
   a small increase in the per capita consumption of final exergy of the
   community.
   The rise of both energy efficiencies is a consequence of the reduction
   in fuelwood consumption and on the use of draft-animals, whose
   conversion efficiencies into final energies and useful work are
   extremely low. Also, there is 314\% increase in the village's fossil
   fuel use, especially due to an increase in the penetration of gas and
   electric appliances into the household sector and of vehicles. The
   energy use in the productive sector including agriculture fell
   dramatically. CO2 emissions from the community's energy use rose by
   279\%. Despite the increase of commercial energy use, and a rapid
   penetration of LPG cookstoves, fuelwood still represents 68\% of the
   village final energy consumption. Also, there is a large mismatch
   between sources and needs in thermodynamic terms: while 72\% of the
   energy needs correspond to work and heat at less than 100 degrees C,
   99\% of the energy sources imply combustion processes (fuelwood, LPG,
   gasoline and diesel) to mid and high temperatures. However, in order to
   reduce CO2 emissions, the electricity and transport devices have to
   increase their efficiencies, and primary energy ought to come in higher
   proportion from renewable sources. (C) 2013 International Energy

Abstract = {Agroecosystems are altered systems whose soil structure has changed
   affecting the dynamics of soil organisms. This paper aims at evaluation
   of the effects of garlic farming practices on phenology, richness,
   abundance, composition and diversity of soil-dwelling Cunaxidae. Ten
   pilot plots in Guanajuato State were sampled from August 2002 to July
   2005, every month, 8 months per year. Ten soil samples (1 kg) were taken
   from each plot and extracted in Berlese-Tullgren funnels. A total of 108
   cunaxids were found, belonging to 11 species. Neocunaxoides andrei was
   the most abundant, and Cunaxa evansi and Armascirus sp. were least
   abundant. Relative abundance was highest after harvesting and during
   plant growth, and lowest during planting. Dactyloscirus nicobarensis and
   D. candylus were present from planting to harvesting. According to
   Sorensen's similarity coefficient between cultivation stages, Cunaxidae
   communities were similar during plant growth and harvesting, sharing 80
   \% of the species. The highest abundance and diversity were found in
   2004, during and after harvesting. Cunaxid species increased over 100 \%
   from planting to the harvesting phase, suggesting that they play an
   important role in the soil agrosystems food web. Species composition and
   diversity in cunaxid communities present in garlic crop fields varied
   with agricultural phase, but little change was observed among the years
   studied. All species found in this study are new records for the state
   of Guanajuato and for the garlic crop fields.},

   induces a bounded non-degenerated co-t-structure on the smallest thick
   triangulated subcategory of containing omega. We also give a description
   of the bounded co-t-structures on (see Theorem 5.10). Finally, as an

   is an abelian hereditary category which is Hom-finite, Ext-finite and
   has a tilting object (see Happel and Reiten, Math Z 232:559-588, 1999),

Title = {Relationship between age and thermoregulatory behaviour of Lithodes
   santolla (Molina, 1782) (Decapoda, Lithodidae) juveniles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {448},
Pages = {141-145},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Along its range of distribution, Lithodes santolla can be fished at
   sites with wide ranges of temperature (5 degrees C to 12 degrees C),
   suggesting a wider temperature tolerance than is observed for other
   members of the Lithodidae family. The present study aimed to evaluate
   the thermoregulatory behaviour of juveniles of L. santolla of different
   ages, maintained in laboratory conditions at 12 degrees C for 390 days
   and based on: i) temperature selected along a thermal gradient and ii)
   thermal window calculated as the tolerance temperature interval. Results
   demonstrate that age is a key factor to be considered in thermal
   tolerance studies, because the thermal tolerance can change, depending
   on the age and life cycle stages. The preferred temperature was 12
   degrees C for animals aged between 45 d and 170 d and was 7.2 degrees C
   and 9.1 degrees C for crabs aged between 260 and 390 d, respectively.
   The critical thermal minimum (CTMin) significantly changed together with
   the age of crab; the highest value (4.2 degrees C) was for animals 260 d
   old and lowest for crabs 45 d old (1.5 degrees C). Critical thermal
   maximum values were also affected by age, with highest values for
   animals aged between 105 d and 170 d (27 degrees C to 27.6 degrees C).
   The temperature tolerance interval fluctuated between 20.5 degrees C and
   25.5 degrees C. Crabs aged between 45 d and 260 d showed the narrowest
   interval (22.9 degrees C and 20.5 degrees C, respectively). Considering
   the thermal limits observed in the present study, a climate change
   scenario with an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme thermal
   events might affect the present distribution of the species. Temperature
   rises would allow L. santolla to explore higher latitudes, whereas a
   temperature decrease when juveniles are searching for a particular
   colder habitat, near to CTMin, might be detrimental to the population.

Abstract = {The highly conserved peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the ribosome
   contains an RNA pore that serves as the entrance to the exit tunnel.
   Analysis of available ribosome crystal structures has revealed the
   presence of multiple additional well-defined pores of comparable size in
   the ribosomal (rRNA) RNAs. These typically have dimensions of 1-2 nm,
   with a total area of similar to 100 angstrom(2) or more, and most are
   associated with one or more ribosomal proteins. The PTC example and the
   other rRNA pores result from the packing of helices. However, in the
   non-PTC cases the nitrogenous bases do not protrude into the pore,
   thereby limiting the potential for hydrogen bonding within the pore.
   Instead, it is the RNA backbone that largely defines the pore likely
   resulting in a negatively charged environment. In many but not all
   cases, ribosomal proteins are associated with the pores to a greater or
   lesser extent. With the exception of the PTC case, the large subunit
   pores are not found in what are thought to be the evolutionarily oldest
   regions of the 23S rRNA. The unusual nature of the PTC pore may reflect
   a history of being created by hybridization between two or more RNAs
   early in evolution rather than simple folding of a single RNA. An
   initial survey of nonribosomal RNA crystal structures revealed
   additional pores, thereby showing that they are likely a general feature
   of RNA tertiary structure.},

Title = {Environmental and social factors account for Mexican maize richness and
   distribution: A data mining approach},

Abstract = {Food security is a key topic for human welfare worldwide. In this
   context, the agrobiodiversity in centers of origin and diversification
   (COD) for the world's staple crops will be critical for feeding the
   world under changing environmental and social conditions. Maize is one
   of the most widely cultivated cereal and is the staple food for African
   and Latin-American countries, including its COD: Mexico, harboring more
   than 60\% of the world's diversity for this crop. In this study we
   implemented a data mining approach that allowed us to evaluate spatial
   relationships of environmental (altitude, climate, slope and soil) and
   social factors (education and ethnic groups) with the spatial
   distribution of Mexican races, as well as the areas that can potentially
   harbor the highest number of races (PRA). In contrast to commonly used
   species distribution approaches, the data mining method implemented here
   allowed the integration of contrasting types of variables and their
   spatial relationships with the focal entity. Our results indicate that
   altitude, which is related with climate, was the factor with highest
   predictive power for most races. However, different factors showed
   different degrees of association with the spatial distribution of
   particular races. In any case, the performance of the model increased
   when using all evaluated factors. In our example study case, the highly
   vulnerable race Palomero Tolguefio was mainly influenced by climate,
   implying that climate change might threaten its preservation by reducing
   the areas with favorable conditions for its cultivation. Importantly,
   however, for this and other eleven races analyzed in detail, is that the
   ethnic group was the factor with the greatest predictive power. This
   finding further reinforces the key importance of in situ conservation by
   supporting local indigenous communities who are in charge of preserving,
   adapting to changing challenges and cultivating local races. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The medicinal plant guayacan is recommended for health problems derived
   from diabetes mellitus. The species most often associated in the
   literature with the common name guayacan is Guaiacum coulteri. For this
   study, anatomical and histochemical comparisons were made of wood
   samples from five markets in Mexico City and of Guaiacum coulteri wood
   deposited in the xylarium MEXUw, housed at the Instituto de Biologia,
   Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. The market samples were
   anatomically dissimilar, not only to Guaiacum coulteri but also to each
   other. The histochemical comparison showed higher lipid and glucoprotein
   contents in the parenchyma of the market samples than in G. coulteri,
   whose parenchyma is scarce. These results demonstrate the importance of
   anatomical characterization of species that are commercialized for
   medicinal use in order to assure an accurate identification. The
   histochemical reactions of samples enabled the structural differences
   among them to be observed with greater precision, and provided more
   information on their cellular composition; however, these results could
   be complemented with a subsequent phytochemical study that would provide
   more information on the compounds in each sample.},

Title = {Cryptic Population Structuring and the Role of the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec as a Gene Flow Barrier in the Critically Endangered Central
   American River Turtle},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {The critically endangered Central American River Turtle (Dermatemys
   mawii) is the only remaining member of the Dermatemydidae family, yet
   little is known about its population structuring. In a previous study of
   mitochondrial (mt) DNA in the species, three main lineages were
   described. One lineage (Central) was dominant across most of the range,
   while two other lineages were restricted to Papaloapan (PAP; isolated by
   the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Sierra de Santa Marta) or the
   south-eastern part of the range (1D). Here we provide data from seven
   polymorphic microsatellite loci and the R35 intron to re-evaluate these
   findings using DNA from the nuclear genome. Based on a slightly expanded
   data set of a total of 253 samples from the same localities, we find
   that mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers yield a highly congruent picture of
   the evolutionary history and population structuring of D. mawii. While
   resolution provided by the R35 intron (sequenced for a subset of the
   samples) was very limited, the microsatellite data revealed pronounced
   population structuring. Within the Grijalva-Usumacinta drainage basin,
   however, many populations separated by more than 300 kilometers showed
   signals of high gene flow. Across the entire range, neither
   mitochondrial nor nuclear DNA show a significant isolation-by-distance
   pattern, but both genomes highlight that the D. mawii population in the
   Papaloapan basin is genetically distinctive. Further, both marker
   systems detect unique genomic signals in four individuals with mtDNA
   clade 1D sampled on the southeast edge of the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin.
   These individuals may represent a separate cryptic taxon that is likely
   impacted by recent admixture.},

Volume = {3716},
Number = {1},

Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Species diversity is largely underestimated by current taxonomy,
   precluding a precise understanding of evolutionary processes. Genetic
   data have increased our understanding of that cryptic diversity, and
   multilocus studies are now desirable. In this study, we used
   mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences to evaluate the taxonomic status
   of the western Mexico's populations of Phaethornis longirostris. We
   found differences of 4.2 \% in mtDNA and different alleles for one nDNA
   locus between western and eastern Mexican populations. Molecular and
   morphological evidence support the separation of these populations (P.l.
   mexicanus and P.l. griseoventer) as the species Phaethornis mexicanus
   Hartert 1897. Phaethornis mexicanus is endemic to western Mexico and
   sister to the remaining populations of P. longirostris. The speciation
   of P. mexicanus probably occurred around 880,000 years ago by a
   vicariant event involving climatic-vegetational changes.},

Title = {The role of fringing coral reefs on beach morphodynamics},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {69-83},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {This paper examines the degree of energy dissipation provided by a
   fringing coral reef, and its role on the morphodynamics of adjacent
   beaches in terms of volumetric sediment transport. Morphological data
   were collected from the microtidal Mexican Caribbean beaches of Puerto
   Morelos, fringed by a reef, and Cancun, without a reef, from September
   2007 to May 2011. Being exposed to the same offshore wave conditions,
   the morphodynamics of the coral reef-fronted beach were compared with
   those of the adjacent beach without a coral reef. Spatio-temporal
   changes in beach morphology were determined applying empirical
   orthogonal functions (EOF) to the shorelines extracted from the
   topographic data, and it was concluded that Puerto Morelos was
   considerably less dynamic than Cancun. The longshore energy fluxes were
   larger in Cancun, and the subaerial morphological differences in both
   beaches and under the same offshore conditions demonstrated that Puerto
   Morelos was particularly stable under shore-normal easterly waves. A
   calibrated phase-averaged wave model was implemented to determine the
   amount of wave energy dissipation across the coral reef. For energetic
   shore-normal waves the model determined that the semi-emerged coral reef
   was capable of reducing up to 85\% of the incident wave height. The
   reef-crest height controlled the amount of wave energy dissipation, and
   the distance between the reef-crest and the shore determined the
   vulnerability of the beach to morphological changes. Reef-crest
   degradation by 1 m resulted in a 10\% increase in incoming wave energy,
   which resulted in 0.9 m(3)/h/m of sand being mobilised along the beaches
   closer to the reef. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {β-Diversity of Functional Groups of Woody Plants in a Tropical Dry
   Forest in Yucatan},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Two main theories have attempted to explain variation in plant species
   composition (beta-diversity). Niche theory proposes that most of the
   variation is related to environment (environmental filtering), whereas
   neutral theory posits that dispersal limitation is the main driver of
   beta-diversity. In this study, we first explored how alpha- and
   beta-diversity of plant functional groups defined by growth form (trees,
   shrubs and lianas, which represent different strategies of resource
   partitioning), and dispersal syndrome (autochory, anemochory and
   zoochory, which represent differences in dispersal limitation) vary with
   successional age and topographic position in a tropical dry forest.
   Second, we examined the effects of environmental, spatial, and
   spatially-structured environmental factors on beta-diversity of
   functional groups; we used the spatial structure of sampling sites as a
   proxy for dispersal limitation, and elevation, soil properties and
   forest stand age as indicators of environmental filtering. We recorded
   200 species and 22,245 individuals in 276 plots; 120 species were trees,
   41 shrubs and 39 lianas. We found that beta-diversity was highest for
   shrubs, intermediate for lianas and lowest for trees, and was slightly
   higher for zoochorous than for autochorous and anemochorous species. All
   three dispersal syndromes, trees and shrubs varied in composition among
   vegetation classes (successional age and topographic position), whilst
   lianas did not. beta-diversity was influenced mostly by proxies of
   environmental filtering, except for shrubs, for which the influence of
   dispersal limitation was more important. Stand age and topography
   significantly influenced alpha-diversity across functional groups, but
   showed a low influence on beta-diversity-possibly due to the
   counterbalancing effect of resprouting on plant distribution and
   composition. Our results show that considering different plant
   functional groups reveals important differences in both alpha- and
   beta-diversity patterns and correlates that are not apparent when
   focusing on overall woody plant diversity, and that have important
   implications for ecological theory and biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {STRUCTURE AND WOODY SPECIES DIVERSITY OF THE DASYLIRION
   CEDROSANUM (NOLINACEAE) ROSETTE SCRUB OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN

Abstract = {The most prominent vegetation type in the state of Coahuila, in northern
   Mexico, is Chihuahuan Desert Scrub. This plant formation encompasses the
   little known Dasylirion cedrosanum (sotol) rosette scrub, a community
   that extends over more than one fourth of Coahuila and whose most
   distinctive species is subjected to intense extraction from its native
   communities for a variety of purposes. Based on a highly replicated
   sampling procedure that included 131 plots located in the state's
   central and southern portions, we analyzed vegetation structure,
   fioristics, and species diversity of this plant community. A cluster
   analysis allowed us to differentiate five variants (associations) of the
   Dasylirion cedrosanum rosette scrub, which together host a richness of
   97 species of vascular plants distributed in 61 genera and 28 families.
   These communities occurred across an elevational range of 850-2,550 m
   a.s.l. Dasylirion cedrosanum density varied between 193 and 705 ind./ha,
   with the highest value occurring in the Quercus intricata-Dasylirion
   cedrosanum association. Other prominent species in these scrublands were
   Agave lecheguilla and Euphorbia antisyphilitica. The Agave
   lecheguilla-Dasylirion cedrosanum. association was the most broadly
   distributed and it hosted the highest richness species, while the
   largest Shannon diversity index value was recorded for the Dasylirion
   cedrosanum-Viguiera greggii association. The effects of human
   utilization of this species on the structure of those plant communities
   where it occurs are largely unknown; further studies are needed to
   better understand its dynamics and to be able to suggest more adequate
   regulations for its commercial harvesting.},

Abstract = {Anthropological studies suggest that the genetic makeup of human
   populations in the Americas is the result of diverse processes including
   the initial colonization of the continent by the first people plus
   post-1492 European migrations. Because of the recent nature of some of
   these events, understanding the geographical origin of American human
   diversity is challenging. However, human parasites have faster
   evolutionary rates and larger population sizes allowing them to maintain
   greater levels of genetic diversity than their hosts. Thus, we can use
   human parasites to provide insights into some aspects of human evolution
   that may be unclear from direct evidence. In this study, we analyzed
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 450 head lice in the Americas.
   Haplotypes clustered into two well-supported haplogroups, known as A and
   B. Haplogroup frequencies differ significantly among North, Central and
   South America. Within each haplogroup, we found evidence of demographic
   expansions around 16,000 and 20,000 years ago, which correspond broadly
   with those estimated for Native Americans. The parallel timing of
   demographic expansions of human lice and Native Americans plus the
   contrasting pattern between the distribution of haplogroups A and B
   through the Americas suggests that human lice can provide additional
   evidence about the human colonization of the New World. (C) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {The effects of feeding two alternative live prey Hyalella azteca
   (freshwater gammarids) and Hyale media (marine gammarids) to Octopus
   maya hatchlings were compared with feeding adult Artemia sp.,
   traditionally used during the first weeks of the life cycle. Hatchlings
   were fed ad libitum these three live preys during the first 15days, and
   a paste elaborated with fresh squid and shrimp during the next 15days
   when hatchling can be fed prepared diets. Weight (g) and specific growth
   rates (\% day(-1)) were determined every 15days. Octopus maya hatchlings
   fed with marine gammarids grew larger (6.9 +/- 0.2\% day(-1)) compared
   with hatchlings fed Artemia sp. or freshwater gammarids (4.8 +/- 0.2\%
   and 5.0 +/- 0.3\% day(-1) respectively). Survival was also higher (92.2
   +/- 6.8\%) for hatchlings fed marine gammarids, than for those fed
   Artemia sp. (74.5 +/- 23.8\%) or freshwater gammarids (41.2 +/- 21.2\%).
   The content of acylglycerides, cholesterol and proteins in O. maya fed
   marine gammarids suggested a better nutrient assimilation by the
   hatchlings. Also, polyunsaturated fatty acids levels (EPA and DHA) were
   more abundant in marine gammarids, possibly contributing to the higher
   growth rates observed. This is the first study revealing a successful
   use of marine gammarids as alternative prey for octopus hatchlings
   culture.},

Title = {FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT IN THE MESQUITE LIZARD (SCELOPORUS

Abstract = {Life-history theory is based on the idea that trade-offs exist in
   allocation of resources. The same energy cannot simultaneously fuel
   growth and reproduction or simultaneously increase size and number of
   offspring. Many genetic, physiological, and environmental variables
   influence how trade-offs manifest and whether they are detectable
   through phenotypic correlations. In most squamates, the absence of
   parental care enables estimation of reproductive investment using mass
   of offspring. This, as well as their diverse ecologies, makes squamates
   an attractive system for empirical tests of life history theory.
   Approximately 20\% of squamates are viviparous, and long gestation
   periods limit most to one litter per year. Carrying offspring until an
   advanced developmental stage may increase the burden of the litter, and
   female abdominal volume may constrain litter size. These factors should
   intensify selection on female tactics of life history and enhance
   detectability of trade-offs. We compare life history of females in two
   species within the Sceloporus grammicus species complex, viviparous
   Mexican lizards from varied habitats. Each inhabits one of the primary
   ecosystems used by this taxon (chaparral and forest). Litter sizes were
   lower in the chaparral population, when adjusted for body size of the
   mother. A trade-off of size versus number of offspring was detected in
   the forest population but not in the chaparral population. The chaparral
   population varied more in average neonate mass between years, which may
   relate to local extinctions, likely linked to climate change, in Mexican
   montane lizards. Regardless of whether these differences represent
   adaptation or plasticity, our findings emphasize the importance of
   environmental influence on trade-offs in life history.},

Abstract = {Aim To test the ` naturalness', or integrity as a biogeographical unit,
   of the Caribbean subregion.
   Location A wide geographical range in the Caribbean (32 degrees N, 115
   degrees W; 10 degrees S, 56 degrees W). As units of analysis, 43
   biogeographical provinces were used: 24 assigned to the Caribbean
   subregion, and 19 provinces situated north and south of this subregion,
   which were used as outgroup areas.
   Methods We analysed 895 plant and animal taxa distributed in the
   Caribbean. We used parsimony analysis of endemicity with progressive
   character elimination (PAE-PCE) to identify generalized tracks and
   nodes, and parsimony analysis of paralogy-free subtrees to infer their
   historical relationships.
   Results We obtained 10 generalized tracks and five nodes from the
   panbiogeographical analysis and 14 most parsimonious general area
   cladograms from the cladistic biogeographical analysis. In general
   terms, the results of both analyses are congruent, reflecting a similar
   history of vicariant events in the Caribbean area.
   Main conclusions Panbiogeographical and cladistic biogeographical
   analyses reflected a similar history of vicariant events in the
   Caribbean: the Caribbean subregion as it is currently defined does not
   represent a `natural' biogeographical unit; the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
   might not represent a conspicuous biogeographical barrier; and the
   biogeographical relevance of the Isthmus of Panama exceeds the last 3
   million years, which is the time it has operated as a connection between
   North and South America.},

Title = {Programmed cell death promotes male sterility in the functional
   dioecious Opuntia stenopetala (Cactaceae)},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {112},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The sexual separation in dioecious species has interested biologists for
   decades; however, the cellular mechanism leading to unisexuality has
   been poorly understood. In this study, the cellular changes that lead to
   male sterility in the functionally dioecious cactus, Opuntia
   stenopetala, are described.
   The spatial and temporal patterns of programmed cell death (PCD) were
   determined in the anthers of male and female flowers using scanning
   electron microscopy analysis and histological observations, focusing
   attention on the transition from bisexual to unisexual development. In
   addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end
   labelling assays were used as an indicator of DNA fragmentation to
   corroborate PCD.
   PCD was detected in anthers of both female and male flowers, but their
   patterns differed in time and space. Functionally male individuals
   developed viable pollen, and normal development involved PCD on each
   layer of the anther wall, which occurred progressively from the inner
   (tapetum) to the outer layer (epidermis). Conversely, functional female
   individuals aborted anthers by premature and displaced PCD. In anthers
   of female flowers, the first signs of PCD, such as a nucleus with
   irregular shape, fragmented and condensed chromatin, high vacuolization
   and condensed cytoplasm, occurred at the microspore mother cell stage.
   Later these features were observed simultaneously in all anther wall
   layers, connective tissue and filament. Neither pollen formation nor
   anther dehiscence was detected in female flowers of O. stenopetala due
   to total anther disruption.
   Temporal and spatial changes in the patterns of PCD are responsible for
   male sterility of female flowers in O. stenopetala. Male fertility
   requires the co-ordination of different events, which, when altered, can
   lead to male sterility and to functionally unisexual individuals. PCD
   could be a widespread mechanism in the determination of functionally
   dioecious species.},

Title = {Morphodynamic Evolution and Sediment Transport Processes of Cancun Beach},

Abstract = {Large-scale construction of tourist infrastructure on beaches around the
   world is consistently linked to unwanted morphological changes that lead
   to coastal erosion. Dune destruction, alteration of sediment sources,
   and the rigidisation of the coastal system are known to be the main
   causes of erosive behaviour on many tourist beaches. To plan sound
   shoreline management strategies, detailed understanding of the sediment
   transport processes is necessary. The present contribution focuses on
   the main sediment transport processes that take place at Cancun, Mexico,
   a large (12 km) and highly developed tourist beach. High-resolution
   quarterly beach profile monitoring from September 2007 to June 2009 is
   used to calculate volumetric changes that are reasonably well explained
   by the spatial patterns of modelled sediment transport potential. This
   parameter was calculated using the wave propagation model WAPO of
   Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, which explicitly solves
   diffraction and reflection processes that are particularly important in
   systems with pronounced rocky headlands, such as the northern and
   southern ends of Cancun beach. Results show a dominance of northward
   longshore transport in most of the system, and an important transport
   divergence with consistent southward transport at the southern end.
   Cross-shore transport seems to dominate the middle-north section of the
   beach. This behaviour is consistent with recent advances in the
   understanding of wave circulation in embayed beaches. The method used
   here is considered a good approximation of sediment transport patterns
   when local (surf zone) morpho- and hydrodynamic data are absent or
   difficult to acquire.},

Abstract = {Many university texts on mechanics consider the effect of air drag

   discuss what happens when the drag force is proportional to both u and

   of both terms on the speed of a runner: a theoretical model of the
   world-record 100 m sprint of Usain Bolt during the 2009 World
   Championships in Berlin is developed, assuming a drag force proportional
   to u and to u(2). The resulting equation of motion is solved and fitted
   to the experimental data obtained from the International Association of
   Athletics Federations, which recorded Bolt's position with a laser
   velocity guard device. It is worth noting that our model works only for

Abstract = {Ten polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci were isolated from Mexican
   four-eyed octopus Octopus maya, by construction of an enriched genomic
   library. Genotyping of 35 individuals from Sabancuy Campeche, M,xico,
   revealed variable levels of locus polymorphism with an average of 9.2
   alleles. The observed and expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from
   0.53 to 0.93 and from 0.48 to 0.87, respectively. No evidence of linkage
   disequilibrium was detected between pairs of loci and genotype
   proportions at all loci conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
   expectations. The microsatellite loci developed constitute a suite of
   genetic markers applicable to sustainable fishery management for O.

Abstract = {A statistical analysis of several morphometric variables of the
   freshwater shrimp Potimiirim mexicana, which has been described as a
   sequential protandrous hermaphrodite, is presented. The purpose of the
   study is to test, statistically, that organisms can be classified by
   sex, analyzing their size and other morphological variables. A total of
   191 organisms were collected in the Maquinas River, Veracruz, Mexico.
   The technique used was that of classification trees, through which will
   likely determines the significant variables in the variable
   ``response{''}, as well as those required for discrimination. This
   technique corroborated the theory that the total length of the body is
   necessary for discrimination of the sex variable, but also brought the
   result that, statistically, two more variables are important in this
   discriminatory process, the length of the second pleopod and length of
   the carpus of the third pereiopod. The technique resulted in a correct
   classification of 82\% using the three variables. What is significant is
   that the process generating the classification tree shown, in a simple
   and practical manneer, the variables necessary for this process and
   their individual discriminatory power.},

Abstract = {Butterflies constitute an useful group to investigate biodiversity
   patterns in specific geographic areas. The aim of this study was to
   describe the altitudinal patterns distribution and to recognize the main
   grouping factors of these families. We conducted a comparative study
   between the butterfly fauna (Papilionidae, Pieridae and Nymphalidae) of
   five Mexican mountain ranges (Sierra de Manantlan, Sierra de Atoyac de
   Alvarez, Loxicha Region, Teocelo-Xalapa and Sierra de Juarez), that
   included 34 sites of altitudinal ranges from 100 to 2 820m. Data was
   obtained from the Zoology Museum of the National University of Mexico,
   and comprised more than 60 000 butterfly records of 398 taxa (subspecies
   level) proceeding during the last 35 years. Fauna similarity between
   localities were analyzed using a cluster analysis by Sorensen similarity
   coefficient. Species richness showed a general tendency to decrease with
   altitude; the main difference was found between the locality with higher
   altitude and the rest of the sites. The principal factors affecting the
   identified clusters followed this order: the location in Pacific or
   Atlantic slope, and location on a particular mountain range. Three
   altitudinal levels (low elevations, up to 1 200m; intermediate
   elevations, from 1 200 to 1 800m; and high elevations, from 1 800 to 2
   500m) were described in accordance to their main characteristic taxa.
   While Neartic elements were common in the highest altitudinal floor,
   Neotropical taxa were common in the lowest one. It was more difficult to
   characterize the intermediate level in which a high number of localities
   were clustered; this intermediate level was characterized by the
   presence of some endemic species. The results suggest that historical
   factors are preeminent in butterfly fauna composition in these areas.
   Future studies may include other Mexican mountain areas to obtain more
   information on the different factors (latitude, altitude, slope)
   influencing biodiversity patterns.},

   distinct from its sister lineage in genotype and phenotype, and clearly
   distinct from all other forms in genotype; however, it has retained an

   Magdalena Bay, Mexico, as a case study},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},

Abstract = {Albeit the need and importance of protected areas worldwide, there is no
   best practice methodology for their placement and design as this depends
   on several factors such as resource availability, data disponibility,
   and technical capacity. In this study, we show a novel approach on the
   use of beta-diversity modeling and landscape metrics for the selection
   of priority conservation areas to assist the management of Magdalena
   Bay, one of the most important bays of Mexico. Quantitative estimates on
   the percentage of cover of benthic substrates from 60 ground truthed
   sites were used to perform a cluster analysis using the Bray-Curtis
   similarity index. Seven habitats were recognized, with habitats
   characterized by an inter-mix of sand, seagrass, macroalgae and rock
   substrates. A thematic map of benthic habitats was produced utilizing a
   supervised classification with the maximum likelihood rule on a natural
   color mosaic of high resolution satellite scenes (overall accuracy 80\%,
   Kappa = 0.69). Matlab was used to calculate beta-diversity values based
   on the nature and distribution of habitats. A weighted overlay analysis
   considering habitat type, patch area/perimeter(2) ratio and
   beta-diversity was performed to prioritize areas for conservation. Three
   areas, which constitute similar to 20\% of the shallow benthic
   landscape, are proposed to be considered within a Marine Protected Area

Abstract = {There are differences in the biotic delimitation and recognition of the
   central part of the Americas, specifically from southern Mexico to
   northern South America. The delimitation of this area has been difficult
   when typical characteristics, product of patterns of distribution of the
   species, and diagnostic criteria are considered in its identification.
   This study present different arguments about the existence of a ``biotic
   Mesoamerica{''} trough the biogeographical knowledge, which can help in
   its recognition and its differences from neighboring areas by biotic
   gradients. Some criteria have been considered and the problems present
   in the understanding of the region have been discussed.},

Abstract = {A systematic density functional study of structural, electronic,

   zig-zag ((n, 0), n = 4, 6, 7, 8), and armchair ((n, n), n = 4, 5) SWCNTs
   are reported. To study the impurity effects on the electronic structure,
   we used the electron localization function, charge density, electronic
   partial density of states, and band structures. The total energy was
   calculated and the geometrical structure determined. We analyzed the
   effect of impurities in the vibrational frequencies, by calculating the
   radial breathing mode (RBM). We also determined the strain energy, the
   Poisson ratio, and the Young modulus, and compared to the properties of
   pristine systems.},

Abstract = {Electron temperature and number density are investigated employing
   hollow cathode dc discharge in O-2. Electron temperature is found to
   decrease from 3 to 1.85 eV as the pressure increases from 75 to 375
   mTorr. Positive and negative ion densities are determined as a function
   of plasma gas pressure. I-V curves are evaluated employing the
   Allen-Boyd-Reynolds (ABR), current balance, orbital motion limited, and
   the floating potential (FP) methods. The ABR method is found to yield
   the highest positive ion number density, whereas the FP method results
   for n(+) are extremely small for any meaningful data. Present results
   are compared to those obtained employing global simulation method as
   well as with other experimental groups. O-2 electronegativity results
   are compared with other experimental and theoretical groups. Optical
   emission spectroscopy is employed and intensity ratio for the 777 and
   845-nm lines is obtained for comparison with other groups concluding
   that O- is the dominant species.},

   useful formula for a characteristic width of the macroion-channeling
   filter, controlling model (dis)ordered protein aggregations in a

   order of an inner half-width of the Stern-type double layer
   circumventing the growing object and depends in turn on an interplay of
   the local thermal and electrostatic conditions. The interfacial
   channeling effect manifests at the edge of biomolecular
   hydration-duration dependent (non)Markovianity of the system. The
   interface vs. solution aggregation late-time dynamics are discussed in
   such local (non)isothermal context with the aim to suggest their

Title = {Some conceptual thoughts toward nanoscale oriented friction in a model
   of articular cartilage},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {244},
Number = {2},
Pages = {188-200},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This work presents a conceptual framework as to how a deficit in the
   synovial-fluid content, exemplified by hyaluronan or any other
   amphiphilic species, is capable of decisively altering the complex
   lubrication and wear conditions observed clinically in articular
   cartilage. The effect is revealed in (non)stationary regimes if the
   cartilage is subjected to some normal periodic load, revealing over its
   exploitation time increasingly dissipative, in general
   entropy-addressing, characteristics. It can be hypothesized that a
   Grotthuss-type proton transport physiology-concerning mechanism in
   channel-like, phospholipid water cartilage's articulating nanospaces
   will be responsible for the expression of the lubrication mode. The
   corresponding wear involving overall change is then manifested
   adequately in the stationary regime, and in a viable system-parametric
   correlation with its lubrication counterpart. Certain analytic formulae
   for the nanoscale oriented coefficient of friction, involving
   generically H-bonds breaking mechanism, and pointing to some
   local-viscosity context, have been proposed for fitting the experimental
   data and clinical observations involving proton management at articular
   cartilage surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Robsonius ground-warblers are forest birds endemic to the Luzon
   Island complex in the Philippine archipelago. Their systematic
   relationships have long remained ambiguous; until recently they were
   included in the timaliid genus Napothera. Two Robsonius species are
   currently recognized on the basis of plumage differences: R. rabori from
   northern Luzon in the Cordillera Central and the northern Sierra Madre,
   and R. sorsogonensis from southern Luzon and Catanduanes Island. Recent
   specimen collections, including the first adult specimen from the
   Cordillera Central, establish plumage differences between populations of
   R. rabori in the Cordillera Central and Sierra Madre and reveal a third
   diagnosable population within Luzon. These differences have gone
   unnoticed because R. rabori (sensu stricto) had been known only from the
   juvenile holotype. Molecular phylogenetic data further support the
   hypothesis that three highly divergent taxa occur across the Luzon
   Island complex: Robsonius rabori is known only from the northern
   Cordillera Central in Ilocos Norte; an undescribed taxon (formerly
   included in R. rabori) occurs in the northern Sierra Madre in Cagayan,
   Isabela, Aurora, and Nueva Vizcaya provinces; and R. sorsogonensis
   occurs in southern Luzon (Bulacan and Laguna provinces), the Bicol
   Peninsula, and on Catanduanes Island. The existence of three putatively
   allopatric species within the Luzon island complex highlights the role
   of in situ diversification in island systems, and brings attention to
   the need for forest conservation to protect geographically restricted
   populations throughout the Luzon Island complex.},

Pages = {75-80},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The structural configurations and magnetic properties of zig-zag
   nanoribbons and nanowires of Fe8-NCoN, for 0 <= N <= 8, are calculated
   within the density functional theory. Both, for the zig-zag nanoribbons
   and the nanowires, there is a tendency towards forming Fe-Co bonds,
   while segregation of the Fe and Co is energetically unfavorable. For the
   nanowire structures a transition from bcc Fe to hcp Co spatial
   arrangements is observed when N is increased from 4 to 6, in spite of
   the small size of the systems under investigation. The energy
   minimization was performed taking into consideration the electronic and
   magnetic structures, since for each crystalline structure, chemical
   composition, and short range order, particular magnetic properties of
   these systems do correspond. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is
   calculated, and it is found that the easy axis changes from a transverse
   direction in Fe-rich systems, to the axial direction as the Co
   concentration increases. It is also found that although there are
   important variations of the local magnetic moment of the components, and
   their particular location in the system, the average magnetic moment is
   an almost linear function of N. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {2013},

Abstract = {This article consists of two sections. In the first one, the concepts of
   spanning and cospanning classes of modules, both hereditarily and
   cohereditarily, are explained, and some closure properties of the class
   of modules hereditarily cospanned by a conatural class are established,
   which amount to its being a hereditary torsion class. This gives a
   function from R-conat to R-tors and it is proven that its being a
   lattice isomorphism is part of a characterization of bilaterally perfect
   rings. The second section begins considering a description of
   pseudocomplements in certain lattices of module classes. The idea is
   generalized to define an inclusion-reversing operation on the collection
   of classes of modules. Restricted to R-nat, it is shown to be a function
   onto R-tors, and its being an anti-isomorphism is equivalent to R being
   left semiartinian. Lastly, another characterization of R being left
   semiartinian is given, in terms solely of R-tors.},

Abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis, of
   largely reversible impairment of brain function occurring in patients
   with acute or chronic liver failure or when the liver is bypassed by
   portosystemic shunts. The mechanisms causing this brain dysfunction are
   still largely unclear. The need to avoid complications caused by late
   diagnosis has attracted interest to understand the mechanisms underlying
   neuronal damage in order to find markers that will allow timely
   diagnosis and to propose new therapeutic alternatives to improve the
   care of patients. One of the experimental approaches to study HE is
   microdialysis; this technique allows evaluation of different chemical
   substances in several organs through the recollection of samples in
   specific places by semi-permeable membranes. In this review we will
   discuss the contributions of microdialysis in the understanding of the
   physiological alterations in human hepatic encephalopathy and
   experimental models and the studies to find novel alternative therapies
   for this disease.},

Title = {The 2.3 GHz continuum survey of the GEM project},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {556},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Context. Determining the spectral and spatial characteristics of the
   radio continuum of our Galaxy is an experimentally challenging endeavour
   for improving our understanding of the astrophysics of the interstellar
   medium. This knowledge has also become of paramount significance for
   cosmology, since Galactic emission is the main source of astrophysical
   contamination in measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
   radiation on large angular scales.
   Aims. We present a partial-sky survey of the radio continuum at 2.3 GHz
   within the scope of the Galactic Emission Mapping (GEM) project, an
   observational program conceived and developed to reveal the large-scale
   properties of Galactic synchrotron radiation through a set of
   self-consistent surveys of the radio continuum between 408 MHz and 10
   GHz.
   Methods. The GEM experiment uses a portable and double-shielded 5.5-m
   radiotelescope in altazimuthal configuration to map 60-degree-wide
   declination bands from different observational sites by circularly
   scanning the sky at zenithal angles of 30 degrees from a constantly
   rotating platform. The observations were accomplished with a total power
   receiver, whose front-end high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)
   amplifier was matched directly to a cylindrical horn at the prime focus
   of the parabolic reflector. The Moon was used to calibrate the antenna
   temperature scale and the preparation of the map required direct
   subtraction and destriping algorithms to remove ground contamination as
   the most significant source of systematic error.
   Results. We used 484 h of total intensity observations from two
   locations in Colombia and Brazil to yield 66\% sky coverage from delta =
   -51 degrees.73 to delta = +34 degrees.78. The observations in Colombia
   were obtained with a horizontal HPBW of 2 degrees.30 +/- 0 degrees.13
   and a vertical HPBW of 1 degrees.92 +/- 0 degrees.18. The pointing
   accuracy was 6 `.84 and the RMS sensitivity was 11.42 mK. The
   observations in Brazil were obtained with a horizontal HPBW of 2
   degrees.31 +/- 0 degrees.03 and a vertical HPBW of 1 degrees.82 +/- 0
   degrees.12. The pointing accuracy was 5 `.26 and the RMS sensitivity was
   8.24 mK. The zero-level uncertainty of the combined survey is 103 mK
   with a temperature scale error of 5\% after direct correlation with the
   Rhodes/HartRAO survey at 2326 MHz on a T-T plot.
   Conclusions. The sky brightness distribution into regions of low and
   high emission in the GEM survey is consistent with the appearance of a
   transition region as seen in the Haslam 408 MHz and WMAP K-band surveys.
   Preliminary results also show that the temperature spectral index
   between 408 MHz and the 2.3 GHz band of the GEM survey has a weak
   spatial correlation with these regions; but it steepens significantly
   from high to low emission regions with respect to the WMAP K-band
   survey.},

Title = {Understanding ontogenetic trajectories of indirect defence: ecological
   and anatomical constraints in the production of extrafloral nectaries},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {112},
Number = {4, SI},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Early ontogenetic stages of myrmecophytic plants are infrequently
   associated with ants, probably due to constraints on the production of
   rewards. This study reports for the first time the anatomical and
   histological limitations constraining the production of extrafloral
   nectar in young plants, and the implications that the absence of
   protective ants imposes for plants early during their ontogeny are
   discussed.
   Juvenile, pre-reproductive and reproductive plants of Turnera velutina
   were selected in a natural population and their extrafloral nectaries
   (EFNs) per leaf were quantified. The anatomical and morphological
   changes in EFNs during plant ontogeny were studied using scanning
   electron and light microscopy. Extrafloral nectar volume and sugar
   concentration were determined as well as the number of patrolling ants.
   Juvenile plants were unable to secrete or contain nectar.
   Pre-reproductive plants secreted and contained nectar drops, but the
   highest production was achieved at the reproductive stage when the gland
   is fully cup-shaped and the secretory epidermis duplicates. No ants were
   observed in juvenile plants, and reproductive individuals received
   greater ant patrolling than pre-reproductive individuals. The issue of
   the mechanism of extrafloral nectar release in T. velutina was solved
   given that we found an anatomical, transcuticular pore that forms a
   channel-like structure and allows nectar to flow outward from the gland.
   Juvenile stages had no ant protection against herbivores probably due to
   resource limitation but also due to anatomical constraints. The results
   are consistent with the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis. As
   plants age, they increase in size and have larger nutrient-acquiring,
   photosynthetic and storage capacity, so they are able to invest in
   defence via specialized organs, such as EFNs. Hence, the more vulnerable
   juvenile stage should rely on other defensive strategies to reduce the
   negative impacts of herbivory.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the taxonomy and distribution of
   the polychaetes of the family Paraonidae from a lagoon-estuarine
   ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico. The samples come from 20 soft bottom
   stations in the Terminos Lagoon during the dry and rainy seasons, of
   which eight included paraonids. In all, 1183 specimens belonging to two
   new species were identified: Aricidea (Acmira) hirsuta (1125 specimens)
   and Paradoneis carmelitensis (58 specimens). A. (A.) hirsuta is clearly
   distinguished from other members of the genus by the presence of
   unidentate curved spines with a dense pubescence along their medium and
   distal margins, and because the median antenna is short. P.
   carmelitensis is mainly characterized by the absence of eyes, by the
   presence of triangular shaped postchaetal prebranchial lobes, and the
   presence of branchiae and lyriform chaetae from chaetiger 4. The
   paraonids occurrence was mainly associated with salinities close to
   marine conditions (31.71 to 35.85 psu). They were almost totally
   collected during the rainy season (1178 specimens from both species) in
   the central and southern areas; during the dry season only five
   specimens of P. carmelitensis were recorded.},

Abstract = {The Xochimilco area in the southeastern part of Mexico City has a
   variety of socioeconomic activities, such as periurban agriculture,
   which is of great importance in the Mexico City metropolitan area.
   Pesticides are used extensively, some being legal, mostly chlorpyrifos
   and malathion, and some illegal, mostly DDT. Sediments are a common sink
   for pesticides in aquatic systems near agricultural areas, and
   Xochimilco sediments have a complex composition with high contents of
   organic matter and clay that are ideal adsorption sites for
   organochlorine (OC) and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. Therefore, it
   is important to have a quick, affordable, and reliable method to
   determine these pesticides. Conventional methods for the determination
   of OC and OP pesticides are long, laborious, and costly owing to the
   high volume of solvents and adsorbents. The present study developed and
   validated a method for determining 18 OC and five OP pesticides in
   sediments with high organic and clay contents. In contrast with other
   methods described in the literature, this method allows isolation of the
   23 pesticides with a 12 min microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and
   one-step cleanup of pesticides. The method developed is a simpler,
   time-saving procedure that uses only 3.5 g of dry sediment. The use of
   MAE eliminates excessive handling and the possible loss of analytes. It
   was shown that the use of LC-Si cartridges with hexane-ethyl acetate
   (75+25, v/v) in the cleanup procedure recovered all pesticides with
   rates between 70 and 120\%. The validation parameters demonstrated good
   performance of the method, with intermediate precision ranging from 7.3
   to 17M\%, HorRat indexes all below 0.5, and tests of accuracy with the
   23 pesticides at three concentration levels demonstrating recoveries
   ranging from 74 to 114\% and RSDs from 3.3 to 12.7\%.},

Abstract = {For a locally compact Hausdorff group G we introduce the notion of a
   uniformly proper G-space. We prove that a uniformly proper G-space X
   admits a closed fundamental set F subset of X; in particular, the
   restriction of the orbit projection X -> X/G to F is a perfect
   surjective map F -> X/G. This is a key result to prove the existence of
   a compatible G-invariant metric on a uniformly proper metrizable
   G-space. Many topological properties, among them metrizability and
   paracompactness, are transferred from X to X/G. We also show that every
   topological group X, endowed with the natural action of any locally
   compact subgroup G subset of X, is a uniformly proper G-space. (C) 2013

   consisting of a risky asset with stochastic volatility and a money
   market. The asset prices are affected by a correlated economic factor,

   to show that any solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation solves
   the optimization problem. When the insurer preferences are exponential,
   we prove the existence of a smooth solution, and we give an explicit
   form of the optimal strategy, also numerical results are presented in
   the case of the Scott model. Finally we use the optimal strategy to get
   an estimate of the ruin probability in finite horizon. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {A new species of Brasilonema (Scytonemataceae, Cyanoprokaryota)

Abstract = {New approaches in taxonomy and the introduction of molecular tools have
   substantially Changed the taxonomy of cyanobacteria, leading to new
   genera and species being defined based on genetic and morphological
   investigations. In addition, molecular tools have confirmed several
   previously defined cyanobacteria genera, including some based on
   morphological and ecological features. Several of them have also been
   split into new generic entities, such as Brasilonema. In the central
   region of Mexico, several populations have been identified to share some
   traits with this new genus. In the region of Tolantongo, Hidalgo (Hgo),
   we found cyanobacteria populations that correspond to Brasilonema
   description (FIORE et al. 2007), however the development of trichomes
   and hormogonia did not agree with the diagnosis of Brasilonema. We
   describe and analyze the cyanobacteria populations that we found in
   Tolantongo, and compare their features with the diagnostic generic
   features and those of several Brasilonema species. The results of
   morphological analyses were tested using molecular phylogenetic data
   derived from 16S RNA gene sequencing and the use of marker cpcBA-IGS for
   phycocyanin operon. From our analyses we conclude that the strain from
   Tolantongo belongs to the genus Brasilonema, and the differences
   observed are sufficient to propose a new species.},

Title = {Early recruitment dynamics in tropical restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1124-1134},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Unassisted secondary succession in abandoned tropical pastures often
   results in species-poor forests of pioneer trees that persist for
   decades. We characterize recruitment rates of woody vegetation in
   planting treatments during the first 60 months of experimental
   restoration on thin, eroded soils at Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. We
   test the hypothesis that recruitment of later-successional trees is
   greater in fenced plots planted with native trees than in fenced
   controls that simulate natural succession, and further that recruitment
   of such species would be greater in plots planted with animal-dispersed
   trees than in those planted with wind-dispersed trees.
   Results indicated much greater recruitment of later-successional
   animal-dispersed trees in planted plots as compared with controls. Three
   censuses per year recorded 960 recruited individuals of 44 species of
   trees and shrubs from 20-60 months after cattle exclusion. Ninety-six
   percent of recruits were not of planted species. Repeated-measures
   analyses of variance indicated that recruited communities included more
   species of pioneers than of later-successional trees and shrubs, with
   more individuals and species dispersed by animals than by wind.
   Recruitment of pioneers did not differ between control and planted
   plots. Later-successional recruits dispersed by animals accumulated >10
   times faster in planted than control plots, with apparent acceleration
   after planted Cecropia obtusifolia and Ficus yoponensis first produced
   fleshy fruits 48 months after cattle exclusion. Sparse
   later-successional wind-dispersed recruits did not differ by treatment.
   Our preliminary results over the first five years after cattle exclusion
   indicate that planted stands clearly accelerate succession through
   accumulation of later-successional trees and shrubs dispersed by
   animals.},

   Objective: Build and validate an instrument specific for the assessment
   of factors influencing a clinical learning environment. Material and
   methods: A Likert-type questionnaire was designed and its content was
   validated, while statistical trials were applied to it to determine its
   psychometric properties. The instrument was refined and assessed twice
   (a pilot of 122 cases on October 2011 and the study of 4,189 PUEM
   residents on March 2012). It consists of 28 items, distributed in four
   dimensions: interpersonal relations (IR), teaching processes (TP),
   institutional culture (IC), and service dynamics (SD). Results:
   Cronbach's a of the whole pilot questionnaire after item refinement and
   4,189 case study was 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. The percentage of
   total variance explained by the first component was 48 and 46\%,
   respectively. Conclusions: The reliability and validity of the whole
   questionnaire and by dimension was adjusted to assess clinical learning
   environments in Mexican contexts and allows ranking specialized medical
   departments.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an implementation of a 2.5-D finite-difference (FD)
   code to model acoustic full waveform monopole logging in cylindrical
   coordinates accelerated by using the new parallel computing devices
   (PCDs). For that purpose we use the industry open standard Open
   Computing Language (OpenCL) and an open-source toolkit called PyOpenCL.
   The advantage of OpenCL over similar languages is that it allows one to
   program a CPU (central processing unit) a GPU (graphics processing
   unit), or multiple GPUs and their interaction among them and with the
   CPU, or host device. We describe the code and give a performance test in
   terms of speed using six different computing devices under different
   operating systems. A maximum speedup factor over 34.2, using the GPU is
   attained when compared with the execution of the same program in
   parallel using a CPU quad-core. Furthermore, the results obtained with
   the finite differences are validated using the discrete wavenumber
   method (DWN) achieving a good agreement. To provide the Geoscience and
   the Petroleum Science communities with an open tool for numerical
   simulation of full waveform sonic logs that runs on the PCDs, the full
   implementation of the 2.5-D finite difference with PyOpenCL is included.

Title = {Spore germination of eight homosporous ferns in a temperature gradient},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {112-117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Temperature determines the germination percentage and germination rate
   of non-dormant fern spores and is known to be a crucial factor for
   breaking or inducing dormancy in seeds. The objective of this study was
   to determine the effect of optimal, supraoptimal and suboptimal
   temperatures on spore germination of eight species of terrestrial
   homosporous ferns. Spores were incubated for one month in a temperature
   gradient from 15 to 35 degrees C in either light or dark. Thereafter,
   the spores were transferred to 25 degrees C and incubated in the light.
   The optimal temperature for germination varied among species, and
   germination inhibition and possible secondary dormancy were induced at
   both suboptimal and supraoptimal temperatures. At 35 or 30 degrees C,
   with light, spores of most species did not germinate or exhibited low
   germination percentages, owing to thermoinhibition or possible
   thermodormancy. In the dark, the spores did not germinate at any of the
   temperatures tested. After the spores were transferred to the light at
   25 degrees C, a high percentage of spore germination was observed.
   Incubation in the dark at different temperatures also promoted high
   germination or dormancy. Temperatures that promoted germination might be
   related to the season that the different species germinate rather than
   their habitat, as a number of species within the same habitat had
   different optimum temperature requirements. Differences in temperature
   requirements may help to form a soil spore bank. It is necessary to
   determine whether secondary dormancy was induced by supraoptimal and
   suboptimal temperatures to further understand spore germination and
   colonisation in the field. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

   Abundant fossil material and excellent preservation of a number of

   characters and their ontogenetic and eco-phenotypic variability. The
   description of some hitherto insufficiently known species has been
   enhanced and/or completed, making easier their subsequent identification
   and allowing their unequivocal generic assignation. Two new genera,
   Huasteca and Trechmannites, are proposed for two already known species
   of radiolitids. The Cardenas Formation exhibits a continuously exposed
   sequence in the vicinity of Cardenas. Thus, precise stratigraphic
   location of all fossil localities and their rudist associations, ranging
   from the early to the early late Maastrichtian, has been possible.},

Title = {Effect of temperature on energetic balance and fatty acid composition of
   early juveniles of Octopus maya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {445},
Pages = {156-165},

Abstract = {Octopus maya is an endemic species located on the continental shelf of
   the Yucatan peninsula. This area is located between the Caribbean Sea
   and the Gulf of Mexico, two ecosystems linked by the Yucatan Channel, in
   which the temperature in the benthos community is regulated by summer
   upwelling. Despite being part of a tropical ecosystem, O. maya's niche
   on the Yucatan peninsula is relatively cold, favoring both growth and
   reproduction of this octopus species. The present study was designed to
   test the effects of temperature on the energy balance of early juveniles
   of O. maya in an attempt to determine the physiological mechanisms
   related to adaptation at relatively low temperatures that are common in
   the Yucatan peninsula and favor growth of this tropical octopus species.
   Fatty acid profiles were also analyzed in attempt to understand how
   experimental temperatures modulate the lipid metabolism of O. maya, and
   to explore if fatty acid profiles can be used as a tool to explain the
   physiological mechanisms that support growth of this cephalopod species
   in the Yucatan peninsula environment. Early juveniles (age: 20 days) of
   O. maya were individually acclimated at 18, 22, 26 and 30 degrees C
   during 20 days. Growth rate, survival, ingestion rate, and fasting and
   feeding oxygen consumption were measured at the end of the experiment.
   Growth rate was affected by temperature, with high growth rates for
   animals maintained between 18 and 26 degrees C, and low rates for
   octopuses maintained at 30 degrees C. Routine and total metabolism
   increased exponentially with temperature, while apparent heat increment
   (R-AHI) was higher for octopuses maintained at 18 degrees C than in the
   rest of the treatments. The energy challenge into biomass production was
   higher for octopuses maintained at 18 to 22 degrees C than 26 degrees C
   or 30 degrees C, demonstrating that low temperatures favor growth,
   probably due to several factors acting simultaneously: 1) a reduction of
   basal metabolism and consequent reduction in overall activity; 2) more
   time available for digestion and thus a better utilization of nutrients
   from food (fatty acids, among others); and 3) an increased time period
   in which to eat a greater quantity of food. Our study provided evidence
   that adaptive mechanisms such as a high ingestion rate and efficient use
   of fatty acids, among others, operate at low temperatures, beyond the
   mechanistic effect that temperature has on the enzymatic kinetics of O.

Abstract = {We study the propagation of shear horizontal waves between the interface
   of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic half-spaces with a
   magneto-electro-mechanical imperfect contact. Mechanical, electrical and
   magnetical imperfections are modelled by means of a spring, a capacitor
   and a inductor, respectively. A general expression for the dispersion
   relation not reported previously in literature is given in an explicit
   form, with the diverse limit cases analysed in detail. In some of these
   limit cases, new expressions are also obtained which predict the
   existence of interfacial waves. In the other cases, when already
   reported results exist, a comparison with them is done. Some physical
   interpretations are derived from the limit cases. The influence of
   mechanical, electrical and magnetical imperfect contacts are shown in
   some numerical examples.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Overcrowd of emergency rooms affects efficiency and
   quality of medical care. Objectives: To describe the
   mathematical-computational system modified overcrowd index which
   measures in real time and in four levels of warnings (non crowded,
   crowded, overcrowded and extreme overcrowded) emergency room saturation
   in a network of hospitals, from only seven simple variables (number of
   available beds, physicians and nurses, number of patients in the waiting
   room, in medical consultation and admitted for further evaluation, as
   well as number of critically ill patients admitted). Materials and
   methods: The modified overcrowd index was exhaustively tested with
   245,280 virtual transactions from seven hospitals in an uninterrupted
   schedule basis simulating hourly surveillance for four years. Results:
   From 224 episodes of overcrowd, 216 (97\%) where correctly identified
   and verified by the network of hospitals warnings, its time series also
   provided useful information about available personnel and resource
   distribution within the hospital network. Conclusions: Modified
   overcrowd index is an efficient tool detecting emergency room overcrowd
   outbreaks in a network of hospitals.},

Abstract = {The goal of this project was to carry out surveys in northern and
   central Mexico to locate extant populations of Kinosternon hirtipes
   chapalaense, K. h. magdalense, and K. h. megacephalum, evaluate their
   conservation status, help establish captive breeding colonies of these
   taxa in the near future, and collect tissues for phylogenetic studies.
   During 2010 and 2011, we were able to locate extant populations of 2 of
   the subspecies (K. h. chapalaense and K. h. magdalense), but K. h.
   megacephalum could not be found. We also failed to locate natural
   springs in a radius of approximately 60 km from the type locality (and
   only known locality) of K. h. megacephalum and believe that this turtle
   is extinct.},

Abstract = {Covalent functionalization of pristine nanodiamond (ND) with
   1,12-diaminododecane (DAD), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN), poly(ethylene
   glycol) diamine (PEGDA), and polyethylenimine (PEI) was carried out by
   employing solvent-free methodology, which is based on thermal instead of
   chemical activation of carboxylic groups at ND surface. A simple
   solubility/dispersibility test in water and isopropanol showed an
   increased lipophilicity of the functionalized samples. The conversion of
   intrinsic carboxylic groups into the corresponding amide derivatives was
   characterized by means of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.
   Thermogravimetric analysis found the highest organic content of about
   18\% for ND-PEI, followed by ND-DAD, for which the contribution of
   covalently bonded diamine was estimated to be of ca. 10\%. In
   temperature programmed desorption measurements with mass spectrometric
   detection, the presence of organic functionalizing groups changed both
   mass spectra and thermodesorption curves of ND. The changes in
   morphology of primary and secondary ND aggregates were characterized by
   scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as by atomic
   force microscopy. The current-voltage measurements under atmospheric
   pressure found an increased conductivity for ND-DAN, as compared to that
   of pristine ND, whereas for ND-DAD, ND-PEGDA and ND-PEI a dramatic
   decrease in conductivity due to functionalization was observed. (c) 2012

Abstract = {The covalent and noncovalent interactions of porphyrins and related
   tetraazamacrocyclic compounds with single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWNTs) is a subject of increasing research effort, directed toward the
   design of novel hybrid nanomaterials combining unique electronic and
   optical properties of both molecular species. In this report, we used
   different experimental techniques as well as molecular mechanics (MM)
   calculations to analyze the adsorption of meso-tetraphenylporphine (or
   5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine, H2TPP) and its complexes with
   Ni(II) and Co(II) (NiTPP and CoTPP, respectively), as well as hemin (a
   natural porphyrin), onto the surface of SWNTs. Altogether, the results
   suggested that all four porphyrin species noncovalently interact with
   SWNTs, forming hybrid nanomaterials. Nevertheless, of all four porphyrin
   species, the strongest interaction with SWNTs occurs in the case of
   CoTPP, which is able to intercalate and considerably disperse SWNT
   bundles, and therefore absorb onto the surface of individual SWNTs. In
   contrast, NiTPP, CoTPP and hemin, due to a weaker interaction, are
   unable to do so and therefore are only capable to adsorb onto the
   surface of SWNT bundles. According to the scanning tunneling microscopy
   (STM) imaging and MM results, the adsorption of CoTPP onto SWNT
   sidewalls results in the formation of porphyrin arrays in the shape of
   long-period interacting helixes with variable periodicity, possibly due
   to different diameters and chiralities of SWNTs present in the samples.
   Since the remaining porphyrin species were found to adsorb onto the
   surface of SWNT bundles, the precise geometry of the corresponding
   porphyrin/SWNT complexes is difficult to characterize. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Noncovalent porphyrin-fullerene hybrids represent promising materials
   for organic photovoltaic applications and the construction of novel
   platforms for the immobilization of diverse molecules. In such hybrids,
   a structural aspect of particular interest is self-assembled monolayers
   (SAMs) of porphyrins on fullerene films supported on solid substrates.
   In the present work, we performed combined theoretical-experimental
   analysis of the behavior of meso-tetraphenylporphine (or
   5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine, H2TPP) and its complexes with
   Ni(II) and Co(II) (NiTPP and CoTPP, respectively) when adsorbed from gas
   phase in vacuum (by means of physical vapor deposition, PVD) onto
   HOPG-supported fullerene C-60 films. The general film morphology was
   characterized by atomic force microscopy, whereas more detailed
   molecular structure as well as the adsorption of porphyrins was studied
   by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The results of STM imaging were
   compared with theoretical models, consisting of graphene sheets covered
   with a dense monolayer of fullerene cages and accommodating H2TPP
   molecules in different ways; their geometry was optimized by using MM+
   force field. The results showed that NiTPP and CoTPP molecules are able
   to form ordered surface structures on the C-60 thin films. The
   geometries observed included such basic structural elements as
   equilateral triangles or parallel rows formed by porphyrin molecules.
   Nevertheless, the areas of the assemblies on C-60 turned out to be very
   limited, owing to the fact that the C-60 thin films are composed of
   overlapping 20-70 nm-sized clusters, whereas each individual cluster
   exhibits additional imperfections; altogether resulting in a highly
   irregular surface, inconvenient for the formation of extended porphyrin
   arrays. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cultural change and loss of ethnoecological knowledge among the Isthmus
   Zapotecs of Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Background: Global changes that affect local societies may cause the
   loss of ecological knowledge. The process of cultural change in Zapotec
   communities of the Oaxacan Isthmus intensified during the first years of
   the 20th century due to industrial and agro-industrial modernization
   projects and an increase in the level of formal schooling. Based on the
   case of the Oaxacan Isthmus, this study assesses the relationship
   between cultural change and the loss of traditional ecological knowledge
   (TEK).
   Methods: Three hundred male heads of family were interviewed from three
   municipalities in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico selected to
   span a wide range of cultural change. Each participant was shown
   herbarium specimens and photographs of a sample of 30 species drawn from
   a pool of 94 representing local plant diversity. Visual recognition of
   each species, knowledge of plant form, generic name, specific name, and
   local uses were scored. The sum of the five scores provided an index of
   global knowledge which we used as a proxy for TEK. Analysis of variance
   revealed differences between groups of economic activities. We collected
   socio-demographic data from the interviewees such as age, level of
   schooling, and competency in the local language. With these data we ran
   a principal component analysis and took the first axis as an index of
   cultural change, and correlated it with the scores obtained each
   respondent.
   Results: We found statistically significant differences between groups
   of people with different economic activities, as well as a highly
   significant negative relationship between the Index of cultural change
   and ecological knowledge at all levels, with regression coefficients
   between 81.2\% and 88.3\%, indicating that cultural change is affecting
   traditional botanical knowledge.
   Conclusions: Our results shown that cultural change, as indicated by
   occupational activity, level of formal schooling, and competence in the
   indigenous language, is negatively associated with the loss of Zapotec
   ethnobotanical knowledge. Heads of family engaged in secondary economic
   activities and services were less culturally competent, especially
   regarding the knowledge of generic and specific names as well as plant
   uses.},

Abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often associated to acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A/H1N1 virus infection. The
   profile of angiogenic and inflammatory factors in ARDS patients may be
   relevant for AKI. We analyzed the serum levels of several angiogenic
   factors, cytokines, and chemokines in 32 patients with A/H1N1 virus
   infection (17 with ARDS/AKI and 15 ARDS patients who did not developed
   AKI) and in 18 healthy controls. Significantly higher levels of VEGF,
   MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 in ARDS/AKI patients were detected.
   Adjusting by confusing variables, levels of MCP-1 >= 150 pg/mL (OR =
   12.0, p = 0.04) and VEGF >= 225 pg/mL (OR = 6.4, p = 0.03) were
   associated with the development of AKI in ARDS patients. Higher levels
   of MCP-1 and IP-10 were significantly associated with a higher risk of
   death in patients with ARDS (hazard ratio (HR) = 10.0, p = 0.02; HR =
   25.5, p = 0.03, respectively) even taking into account AKI. Patients
   with influenza A/H1N1 infection and ARDS/AKI have an over-production of
   MCP-1, VEGF and IP-10 possibly contributing to kidney injury and are
   associated to a higher risk of death. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-224},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Vegetative propagation of three species of Bursera (B. glabrifolia, B.
   copallifera and B. linanoe) was studied. Cuttings were collected during
   the dry season, when trees were leafless and dormant. In a first trial,
   the effects of species, indol-butyric acid concentration (control,
   4,000, and 9,000 ppm), and relative age of stockplants (young vs. mature
   trees) on rooting success were evaluated. Percentage of rooted cuttings
   and number of roots per cutting differed significantly among species,
   indol-butyric acid, and age of the stockplants. The three species
   studied showed increased rooting when indol-butyric acid was applied
   compared to the control, but sensitivity to applied indol-butyric acid
   varied relative to the type of cutting. Cuttings from young stockplants
   attained higher rooting percentages but were less responsive to
   indol-butyric acid application. In a second trial performed later in the
   dry season, one species (B. linanoe) showed a significant increase in
   rooting success. Overall, rooting percentages higher than 70\% were
   attained when the sources of cuttings were young stockplants and when
   indol-butyric acid was applied. These results show that propagation of
   these species from cuttings is feasible. Rooted cuttings may be used for
   the restoration of degraded secondary tropical dry forests, where they
   are usually absent, for commercial plantations, or in agroforestry.},

Abstract = {Standard karyotypes of two species of the genus Scincella, S. assata and
   S. cherriei, both from Chiapas State, Mexico, were described for the
   first time. The diploid chromosome number was 28 in S. assata, whereas
   30 in S. cherriei. The karyotypes of the two species, while differing in
   the number of microchromosomes, 14-15 in S. assata and 16-17 in S.
   cherriei, share four pairs of large metacentric, two pairs of
   medium-sized metacentric, and one particular pair (number 7) of
   chromosomes. Female S. assata carries chromosome pair 7 composed of two
   identical medium-sized subtelocentric chromosomes. This chromosome pair
   is heteromorphic in males of both species, i.e., one component of the
   pair is similar to the homomorphic chromosomes 7 of the S. assata
   female, while the other is nearly one-half the size of its counterpart
   and resembles a microchromosome. The homology of such externally
   different elements is deducted from the presence of an asymmetric
   bivalent in spermatocytes at diplotene-diakinesis. Female S. cherriei
   was not available. We suspect that the two Scincella species possess an
   XY sex determination system, as previously reported for the North
   American congeneric species, S. lateralis.},

Abstract = {We performed a genome-wide association study of non-Hispanic, white
   individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs; n =
   1,616) and controls (n = 4,683), with follow-up replication analyses in
   876 cases and 1,890 controls. We confirmed association with TERT at

   seven newly associated loci (P-meta = 2.4 x 10(-8) to 1.1 x 10(-19)),
   including FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9

Title = {Evolution of karyotype, sex chromosomes, and meiosis in mygalomorph

Abstract = {Spider diversity is partitioned into three primary clades, namely
   Mesothelae, Mygalomorphae, and Araneomorphae. Mygalomorph cytogenetics
   is largely unknown. Our study revealed a remarkable karyotype diversity
   of mygalomorphs. Unlike araneomorphs, they show no general trend towards
   a decrease of 2n, as the chromosome number was reduced in some lineages
   and increased in others. A biarmed karyotype is a symplesiomorphy of
   mygalomorphs and araneomorphs. Male meiosis of some mygalomorphs is
   achiasmatic, or includes the diffuse stage. The sex chromosome system
   X1X20, which is supposedly ancestral in spiders, is uncommon in
   mygalomorphs. Many mygalomorphs exhibit more than two (and up to 13)
   Xchromosomes in males. The evolution of Xchromosomes proceeded via the
   duplication of chromosomes, fissions, XX, and X-autosome fusions.
   Spiders also exhibit a homomorphic sex chromosome pair. In the germline
   of mygalomorph males these chromosomes are often deactivated; their
   deactivation and pairing is initiated already at spermatogonia.
   Remarkably, pairing of sex chromosomes in mygalomorph females is also
   initiated at gonial cells. Some mygalomorphs have two sex chromosome
   pairs. The second pair presumably arose in early-diverging mygalomorphs,
   probably via genome duplication. The unique behaviour of spider sex
   chromosomes in the germline may promote meiotic pairing of homologous
   sex chromosomes and structural differentiation of their duplicates, as
   well as the establishment of polyploid genomes.(c) 2013 The Linnean

Abstract = {We tested whether and how functional composition changes with succession
   in dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico. We hypothesized
   that compositional changes during succession in dry forest were mainly
   determined by increasing water availability leading to community
   functional changes from conservative to acquisitive strategies, and in
   wet forest by decreasing light availability leading to changes from
   acquisitive to conservative strategies. Research was carried out in 15
   dry secondary forest plots (5-63 years after abandonment) and 17 wet
   secondary forest plots (<1-25 years after abandonment). Community-level
   functional traits were represented by community-weighted means based on
   11 functional traits measured on 132 species. Successional changes in
   functional composition are more marked in dry forest than in wet forest
   and largely characterized by different traits. During dry forest
   succession, conservative traits related to drought tolerance and drought
   avoidance decreased, as predicted. Unexpectedly acquisitive leaf traits
   also decreased, whereas seed size and dependence on biotic dispersal
   increased. In wet forest succession, functional composition changed from
   acquisitive to conservative leaf traits, suggesting light availability
   as the main driver of changes. Distinct suites of traits shape
   functional composition changes in dry and wet forest succession,
   responding to different environmental filters.},

   spatial dynamics of this population. We used a dynamic model of spatial
   distribution to estimate population movement rates between adjacent
   areas. The model was applied using information on catch per unit effort
   and length-frequency distributions for the Mexican mid-sized fleet that
   operated in the area in the period 1973-1977. These data were chosen to
   ensure that the information would reflect the condition of the resource
   before overfishing. It was possible to quantify the spatial dynamics of
   the red grouper and the results were consistent with previously known
   movement patterns. The results showed different movement rates and
   temporal patterns of movement for different population sectors. The
   spawning aggregations and the seasonal upwelling occurring in the
   eastern part of the Bank were considered as key factors influencing the
   pattern of population movements.},

Abstract = {Mexican temperate forests show a high species diversity as well as
   endemisms; therefore, the development of strategies for their
   conservation is a priority. Studies on their natural regeneration are
   crucial in order to understand the changes in species composition and
   for their restoration. The composition and abundance of seed rain and
   seed bank was analyzed during a year (dry and rainy seasons included),
   with the objective to evaluate their contribution to natural
   regeneration in temperate forests (Quercus spp., Abies religiosa and
   Pinus hartwegii forests) in the Magdalena river basin (MRB).
   Particularly, richness and quantity of diaspores in the seed rain, and
   the richness and quantity of seedlings in the seed bank were quantified.
   Comparison was carried out between them and also with respect to the
   extant vegetation. Richness resulted higher in the seed rain, with an
   important fraction of herbaceous, shrub and tree species characteristic
   of temperate forests. In the seed bank, two of the three main tree
   species in the area were absent, and there was a high abundance of
   herbaceous species characteristic of the early succession. The smallest
   similarity of species was found between the seed bank and the extant
   vegetation. Knowledge of the natural regeneration potential in the seed
   rain and in the seed bank allows for the consideration of certain
   species to be prescribed in management plans, with the aim to produce
   vegetation conditions similar to those of the original temperate
   forests.},

Abstract = {The amphibian genus Leptodactylus includes around 50 species, of which
   only 2 are distributed in Mexico; the helminth fauna of these 2 species
   is poorly known. As part of a research program on amphibian parasites in
   Mexico from 1997 to 2005, 281 sabinal frogs Leptodactylus melanonotus
   from 42 localities in 11 Mexican states were examined from a
   helminthological perspective. A total of 20 taxa of helminths-7
   digeneans (5 adults, 2 larvae) and 13 nematodes (8 adults, 5 larvae)-was
   found to infect this amphibian host species. These data represent 105
   new locality records, and 11 taxa are recorded in L. melanonotus for the
   first time. Infracommunity analyses of the sabinal frogs from Tres Palos
   indicated that these hosts are depauperate. The helminth community is
   dominated by specialist species, with Cosmocerca podicipinus the most
   common in almost 50\% of the infracommunities. Percutaneous infection
   and predator-prey interactions were the 2 most common infection routes
   by helminths in frogs from Tres Palos, with 79\% of the parasites
   recruited via skin penetration. Finally, our results show that the
   helminth fauna parasitizing L. melanonotus throughout Mexico has low
   similarity with the helminth fauna of leptodactylids studied
   comprehensively in South America, with only 2 digeneans and 3 nematodes
   being shared by hosts from both regions. As a result of our survey, the
   number of helminth species parasitizing L. melanonotus increased to 34.
   Considering its native distribution range, this number is now 36 with
   the inclusion of the nematodes Oswaldocruzia costaricensis and Cruzia
   empera in Costa Rica.},

Abstract = {A new species of Xenosaurus from the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve of
   northeastern Queretaro, Mexico, is described. The new species differs
   from all of the other described species of the genus by having usually 2
   postrostral scales on each side of the midline (in 84.6\% of the
   specimens, n=26); largest supraoculars that are not, or only slightly,
   wider than long; postorbital and zygomatic ridges that are widely
   separated from each other by an intervening row of scales; labiomental
   rows that usually extend posteriorly from the second or third chinshield
   (in 92.3\% of the specimens, n=26); 23-26 lamellae under the fourth toe
   ((x) over bar =24.3, n=25); a venter that is immaculate or with only
   diffuse, scattered dark specks on the sides, and a postorbital region
   rounded, lacking a canthus temporalis demarcated by enlarged or
   well-defined scales. The new species inhabits oak forest and a
   transitional zone between oak forest and subperennial tropical forest at
   approximately 1 100-1 400 m of elevation. The new species is
   morphologically most similar to X. platyceps from Tamaulipas, but does
   not appear to be its sister taxon.},

Title = {Biogeographic regionalization of the mammals of tropical evergreen

Journal = {REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Mesoamerica is a biologically complex zone that expands from Southern
   Mexico to extreme Northern Colombia. The biogeographical patterns and
   relationships of the mammalian fauna associated to the Mesoamerican
   Tropical Evergreen Forest (MTEF) are poorly understood, in spite of the
   wide distribution of this kind of habitat in the region. We compiled a
   complete georeferenced database of mammalian species distributed in the
   MTEF of specimens from museum collections and scientific literature.
   This database was used to create potential distribution maps through the
   use of environmental niche models (ENMs) by using the Genetic Algorithm
   for Rule-Set Production (GARP) using 22 climatic and topographic layers.
   Each map was used as a representation of the geographic distribution of
   the species and all available maps were summed to obtain general
   patterns of species richness in the region. Also, the maps were used to
   construct a presence-absence matrix in a grid of squares of 0.5 degrees
   of side, that was analyzed in a Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE),
   which resulted in a hypothesis of the biogeographic scheme in the
   region. We compiled a total of 41527 records of 233 species of mammals
   associated to the MTEF. The maximum concentration of species richness
   (104-138 species) is located in the areas around the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec, Northeastern Chiapas-Western Guatemala, Western Honduras,
   Central Nicaragua to Northwestern Costa Rica and Western Panama. The
   proposed regionalization indicates that mammalian faunas associated to
   these forests are composed of two main groups that are divided by the
   Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca in: a) a Northern group that includes
   Sierra Madre of Chiapas-Guatemala and Yucatan Peninsula; and b) an
   austral group, that contains the Pacific slope of Chiapas towards the
   South including Central America. Some individual phylogenetic studies of
   mammal species in the region support the relationships between the areas
   of endemism proposed, which suggest a common biogeographical history. In
   spite that Mesoamerica is considered one of the most important hotspots
   for biological conservation, the poor knowledge of the biogeographic
   patterns, the scarcity of protected areas, and the high rate of habitat
   transformation due to human activities, make prioritary the development
   of conservation strategies that include patterns of species richness,
   endemism, and mammalian associations.},

Abstract = {Recent molecular studies on the Burseraceae phylogeny point out that the
   Bursera - Commiphora complex is monophyletic. Both genera develop a
   brightly colored paseudaril, and it is possible to presume which tissue
   is a homologous character. This work analyzes the development of this
   tissue in 14 species of Bursera, with the aim to determine the existence
   of a single type of ontogenetic origin. The overall development of the
   pseudaril in Bursera is described from a histological point of view and
   it is compared with the development of this tissue in Commiphora, as
   reported in the literature. Results indicate that the exocarp and
   endocarp sensu strict derive from the external and internal epidermis,
   respectively, whereas the pseudaril differentiates from mesocarp in both
   genera. The primary difference in fruit development between the 2
   sections of Bursera consists in the pseudaril differentiation, which
   initiates in earlier developmental stages in species of section
   Bullockia compared to those of section Bursera. To conclude, ontogeny
   and function of the pseudaril of Bursera agree with that described for
   Commiphora; thus, it is strongly suggested that the aforesaid tissue is
   homologous in both genera.},

Abstract = {We propose two hypotheses to explain the inexistence of adequate
   prepared diet for Octopus maya at this date: Hypothesis 1 is related to
   changes in protein structure during protein cooking, which affects the
   digestibility. Hypothesis 2 is related to changes on nutritional
   characteristics during ingredient process, which affects the nutritional
   composition of diet. To test hypothesis 1, experiments one and two were
   directed to determine if protein cooking reduces digestibility and
   growth of animals when compared to fresh or lyophilized protein sources.
   For hypothesis 2, three experiments were conducted, testing seven
   different dietary protein sources offered in isolation or combined in
   artificial diets fed to O. maya. Results demonstrated that the diets
   that promoted growth were the ones based on fresh crab paste, and both
   lyophilized crab and squid tentacles paste. In consequence hypothesis 1
   was accepted. The cooking process also changed nutritional
   characteristics of protein sources, affecting the growth of O. maya.
   Results obtained when squid and crab were mixed suggest that nutritional
   requirements of octopuses were covered with that diet in similar forms
   compared to when using fresh or lyophilized crab, also confirming
   hypothesis 2. Based on growth rates obtained, we can conclude that
   nutritional requirements of O. maya must be between 80\% and 86\%
   Protein (P), 5.1-5.6\% Lipids and a protein: energy ratio between (P/E)
   38.9 and 42.2gMJ-1.},

Abstract = {The Sierra Madre Oriental region in the mexican state of San Luis Potosi
   is a relevant place for bird conservation at a country level. Therefore
   the main goal of this study was to analyze the geographic patterns of
   distribution and the conservation current state of the birds, to support
   the needs to expand the conservation areas in the future. Data was
   collected from various databases of zoological museums and collections,
   and field sampling methods conducted from January 2009 to May 2011.
   Potential distributions were modeled for 284 species using GARP software
   and then a map was developed to determine areas with favorable
   environmental characteristics for the distribution of species richness.
   Finally, the importance of conservation areas for the potential
   distribution of birds in the region was evaluated. A total of 359
   species were recorded of which 71.4\% are permanent residents, 19\% are
   winter migrants and 4\% are summer residents. From this total, 41
   species were endemic, 47 were species at risk and 149 were neotropical
   migrants. The largest species richness correspond to oak forests, cloud
   forests, and tropical moist forests located at altitudes from 100m to
   1500m. Their potential distribution was concentrated towards the center
   and Southeast of the study area. Only 10\% of areas with a high
   potential conservation was included in areas of priority for bird
   conservation (AICA) and just 3\% of all potential areas were under some
   governmental category of protection. However, no conservation area has a
   management plan currently applied and monitored. The information
   generated is important for the development of management proposals for
   birds conservation in the region.},

Abstract = {An experimental investigation of near field aerodynamics of wind
   dispersed rotary seeds has been performed using stereoscopic digital
   particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The detailed three-dimensional flow
   structure of the leading-edge vortex (LEV) of autorotating mahogany
   seeds (Swietenia macrophylla) in a low-speed vertical wind tunnel is
   revealed for the first time. The results confirm that the presence of
   strong spanwise flow and strain produced by centrifugal forces through a
   spiral vortex are responsible for the attachment and stability of the
   LEV, with its core forming a cone pattern with a gradual increase in
   vortex size. The LEV appears at 25\% of the wingspan, increases in size
   and strength outboard along the wing, and reaches its maximum stability
   and spanwise velocity at 75\% of the wingspan. At a region between 90
   and 100\% of the wingspan, the strength and stability of the vortex core
   decreases and the LEV re-orientation/inflection with the tip vortex
   takes place. In this study, the instantaneous flow structure and the
   instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields measured in planes parallel
   to the free stream direction are presented as contour plots using an
   inertial and a non-inertial frame of reference. Results for the mean
   aerodynamic thrust coefficients as a function of the Reynolds number are
   presented to supplement the DPIV data.},

Abstract = {Heraclides androgeus epidaurus was described and illustrated by Godman
   \& Salvin in 1890 based on specimens obtained in Veracruz, indicating
   that their distribution encompassed both the Pacific and Atlantic sides
   of Mexico. Later authors commented that there were morphological
   differences between the male wings from both populations. We analyzed,
   described and nominated Heraclides androgeus reyesorum ssp. nov. Vargas,
   Llorente \& Luis distributed in the Mexican Pacific coast, based on 62
   specimens, and compared it with H. a. epidaurus from the Gulf of Mexico,
   based on more than 200 specimens housed at UNAM: Museo de Zoologia,
   Facultad de Ciencias and the Coleccion Nacional de Insectos of the
   Instituto de Biologia, as well as some collections from the USA. The
   main characters were the width of the yellow and black bands on
   forewings in males, which had a significant difference between the
   populations of both sides of Mexico, although some characters were
   variable and showed partial overlap. In the hindwings, the differences
   were the extent of the subterminal lunules in dorsal and ventral view.
   We also analyzed the male genitalia, finding notorious differences in
   both sclerotic processes of the harpe. Subspecific differences between
   females refer to the brightness and extent of green spots on the
   hindwings and the extent of lunules in the ventral view. The greatest
   abundance of H. a. reyesorum ssp. nov. was in the tropical deciduous
   forest, with gallery forest and in the lower range of the cloud forest,
   present at altitudes of 500-800m and 1 000-1 750m, respectively. We
   discussed the pattern of endemism due to historical vicariant processes
   and explain the presence of the new subspecies of H. androgeus and other
   taxa of specific level.},

Title = {Evaluation of the degree of mycophilia-mycophobia among highland and
   lowland inhabitants from Chiapas, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Background: Mushrooms generate strong and contrasting feelings ranging
   from extreme aversion to intense liking. To categorize these attitudes,
   Wasson and Wasson coined the dichotomic terms ``mycophilia{''} and
   ``mycophobia{''} in 1957. In Mesoamerica these categories have been
   associated to ecological regions. Highland peoples are viewed as
   mycophiles, whereas lowland inhabitants are considered mycophobes.
   However, this division is based on little empirical evidence and few
   indicators. This study questioned whether mycophilia and mycophobia are
   indeed related to ecological regions through the evaluation of 19
   indicators tested in the highlands and lowlands of Chiapas, Mexico.
   Methods: The heterogeneity of attitudes toward mushrooms was explored in
   terms of ecological region and sociocultural variables. Information was
   obtained through structured interviews in 10 communities in Los Altos de
   Chiapas (highlands) and the Selva Lacandona (lowlands). We analyzed
   indicators separately through chi(2) tests and multivariate techniques.
   The Mycophilia-Mycophobia Index was also used in the analysis. To assess
   which factors better explain the distribution of attitudes, we built 11
   models using the Beta probability-density function and compared them
   with the Akaike Information Criterion.
   Results: Most people had positive attitudes in both ecological regions.
   The classification and ordination analyses found two large groups
   comprising both highland and lowland towns. Contrary to expectation if
   mycophilia and mycophobia were mutually exclusive, all the fitted
   probability distributions were bell-shaped; indicating these attitudes
   behave as a continuous variable. The model best supported by data
   included occupation and ethnicity. Indigenous peasants had the highest
   degree of mycophilia.
   Discussion: Results suggest the studied populations tend to be
   mycophilic and that their attitudes are not dichotomic, but rather a
   gradient. Most people occupied intermediate degrees of mycophilia.
   Despite the remarkable similarity in the degree of mycophilia between
   ecological regions, the Principle-Coordinates Analysis shows differences
   in the specific way in which people from either region establishes a
   cultural relationship with mushrooms. The comparison of models suggests
   that sociocultural variables explains the differences better than
   ecological regions do. The obtained results are evidence of mycophilia
   among lowlands inhabitants in the Mayan region and of the fact that the
   mycophilia-mycophobia phenomenon is not expressed as a bimodal frequency
   distribution.},

Abstract = {The preference of the hermit crab Calcinus californiensis Bouvier, 1898
   among six shell species and different shell sizes was evaluated in the
   presence of the swimming crab Arenaeus mexicanus (Gerstaecker, 1856), a
   natural predator of this species. In a second experiment, the survival
   benefit of the shell choice made under predation threat was examined by
   exposing hermit crabs occupying three different shell species (including
   the most and least preferred shells of two fits) to a free swimming crab
   predator. The preference for shell species was similar in the absence
   and presence of the predator threat, although the hermit crabs choose
   larger shells (loose) when exposed to the predator compared with the
   ones chosen in its absence. The predatory experiment showed a higher
   survival chance for the hermit crabs occupying loose shells of the
   preferred shell species (Cantharus sanguinolentus (Duclos, 1833)). The
   results of this study show that the hermit crab C. californiensis is
   able to change their preference for shell size in response to a
   predation threat and that the change in preference confers survival
   benefits for hermit crabs. This study is consistent with the assumption
   that predation is an important selective pressure for intertidal hermit

Abstract = {Lung fibrosis is the final result of a large number of disorders and is
   usually considered an irreversible process. However, some evidence
   suggests that fibrosis could eventually be reversible. In this study we
   aimed to document the time-related reversibility of bleomycin-induced
   lung fibrosis and to examine the gene expression profile associated with
   its initial progression and subsequent resolution. C57BL/6 mice were
   instilled with a single dose of bleomycin and euthanized at 1, 4, 8, 12,
   and 16 wk. Control animals received an equal volume of saline. Lung
   fibrosis was examined by morphology and hydroxyproline content and the
   transcriptional signature by gene microarray analysis. Our results
   showed that bleomycin-injured mice developed prominent inflammation at 1
   wk, followed by fibrosis that peaked at 2 mo. Then fibrosis resolved
   until lungs displayed almost normal architecture at 4 mo. Genomewide
   transcriptional profiling revealed 533 significantly changed genes.
   Self-organizing maps analysis of these genes identified four clusters
   based on the temporal pattern of gene expression. Clusters 1 and 2
   contained genes upregulated during the inflammatory and fibrotic
   response and were enriched for extracellular matrix-related genes
   including several collagens, matrix metalloproteinases, and TIMP-1.
   Cluster 3 identified upregulated genes during the fibrotic response, and
   cluster 4 contained genes decreased during inflammation and fibrosis
   that increased during resolution. Most enriched pathways included genes
   involved in cell cycle and in regulation of transcription. Our findings
   corroborate the reversibility of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and
   reveal transcriptional signatures that characterize the progression and
   resolution.},

Title = {Forest soil conservation in central Mexico: An interdisciplinary
   assessment},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {280-287},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {An inter-disciplinary assessment of the conservation practices on forest
   soils in Mexico was conducted (i) to evaluate their effectiveness in
   terms of soil quality indicators and (ii) to use social indicators of
   their acceptance and execution; such information would be a means of
   improving the design and implementation of public policy. After four
   years of soil conservation measures in areas under common ownership,
   involving ditches, individual terraces or arrangement of plant material,
   soil indicators such as bulk density, total carbon, total nitrogen and
   pH in nine sites and 54 plots showed deficiencies in soil properties
   involved in productivity and hydrological regulation, in comparison with
   the control groups. The results suggest that the conservation practices
   are not improving any of these functions. Social indicators revealed
   that the soil conservation program only encourages participation through
   economic stimulus without considering that non-financial interest can
   play an important role, then the rate of adoption and replication of
   these measures is low. These results led us to make some suggestion with
   policy implications such as taking into account landscape heterogeneity
   and social complexity to define conservation actions; considering
   strengthening conservation attitudes among ejidatarios and also to
   assess the conservation program through results that have measured the
   impact of the practices on the recovery of soil quality.
   Interdisciplinary approaches to understand attitudes for soil
   conservation are a prerequisite in future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Reexamining BCS theory leads one to formulate a generalized BEC
   formalism (GBEC) that is essentially a boson-fermion (BF) model with not
   two but three constituents, two bosonic being two-electron Cooper pairs
   (2eCPs) plus two-hole CPs (2hCPs), along with unpaired electrons. This
   ternary BF model contains three new ingredients: (i) CPs as real bosons
   in contrast to BCS pairs, which are at best so-called ``hard-core
   bosons,{''} (ii) 2hCPs explicitly accounted for on an equal footing with
   2eCPs, and (iii) four BF vertex interactions (analogous to
   electron-phonon vertices) describing the formation and dissociation of
   both 2eCPs and 2hCPs. The two pure gauge-invariant GBEC phases (of a
   total of four including the trivial normal phase) that result exhibit
   substantially higher T(c)s than BCS theory. In addition, in contrast to
   the well-known BCS exponential rise of T-c from zero, the GBEC scheme
   exhibits the linear rise as function of doping typically observed in
   high-T-c superconductors.},

   adsorbed regimes have been addressed by means of a coarse grain van der

   stationary cyclic dynamics are observed upon varying shear flow
   intensity and surface potential strength. Polymer stretching decreases
   as increasing the attractive potential strength, breaking down the
   scaling predictions for non-adsorbed polymers. We found that adsorption
   is enhanced by the shear flow strength in agreement to simulations of

Abstract = {Polyphasic analysis was carried out of natural samples and strains
   isolated from Phormidium mats, collected from different Spanish rivers
   with distinct water quality. 16S rRNA gene analysis separated five main
   clusters in a phylogenetic tree corresponding to five main, previously
   observed morphotypes. Two isolated strains and three natural samples had
   a relatively homogeneous morphology, which could correspond to
   Phormidium autumnale, and their sequences grouped in a well-supported
   cluster (morphotypegenotype I). However, ultrastructural differences
   were found among representatives from this cluster, and three clades
   could be separated in a further phylogenetic analysis. The samples
   belonging to the first clade were characteristic of hypertrophic waters,
   while representatives of the second grew in mesotrophic conditions, and
   those of the third in eutrophic waters. These results suggested that our
   representatives of morphotypegenotype I belong to three different
   species. According to our results and other published data,
   complementary information was obtained on the basis of morphological,
   phylogenetic and ecological criteria. Morphotypegenotype II,
   corresponding to Phormidium terebriforme, is a potential indicator of
   polluted waters. Oscillatoria tenuis, corresponding to
   morphotypegenotype III, is characteristic of eutrophic conditions.
   Phormidium mats identified as Phormidium corium (morphotypegenotype IV)
   were found to be characteristic of waters with low nutrient levels.
   Finally, morphotypegenotype V, identified as Phormidium
   aerugineo-caeruleum was dominant in oligo- to mesotrophic conditions.},

Abstract = {The classical 2D dynamics of a particle moving under an inverse square
   potential, -k/r(2), is analysed. We show that such problem is an example
   of a geometric system since its negative energy orbits are equivalent to
   free motion on a certain hypersurface. We then solve in momentum space,
   the corresponding unrenormalized quantum problem showing that there is
   no discrete energy spectrum and, particularly, no ground state. (C) 2013

Volume = {222},

Abstract = {We analyze the kinetics of diffusion-adsorption processes of one
   component systems in micropores. In realistic situations, the pores
   exhibit irregular forms which give rise to inhomogeneous adsorption with
   preferred sites for the adsorbing particles. By modeling the tortuosity
   of the pores by means of entropic barriers, we obtain a kinetic equation
   for the averaged concentration of particles along the pore and on its
   surface. The analysis performed yields expressions for the adsorption
   rate, the effective diffusion coeffcient, the adsorption isotherms and
   the concentration of the adsorbed particles. It is shown that this last
   quantity strongly depends on the form of the pore. This feature opens
   the possibility to design micropores with an optimal adsorption rate at
   selected sites. Our results show that to consider the geometry of the
   pore in the reaction-diffusion scheme is crucial to reproduce
   experimental observations of the concentration of adsorbed particles in
   micropores.},

Title = {Paleoenvironment and Human Occupation in the Maya Lowlands of the

Abstract = {Paleosol sequences along the lowest terraces of the Usumacinta River in
   southern Mexico were used to reconstruct Holocene environmental changes
   and examine humanenvironmental interactions. Study sections were
   correlated through paleosol morphology, radiocarbon dating, and artifact
   seriation of Formative, Classic, and Postclassic ceramics. The oldest
   paleosols have gleyic features. Although they contain hard carbonate
   concretions dating to 54505380 cal. yr B.P., these Gleysols formed in
   the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene. Carbonates were deposited later.
   The uppermost paleosols lack gleyic features, the oldest of which
   contains vertic features, dating to 20002700 cal. yr B.P., and contains
   abundant Formative period ceramics. The upper two paleosols are
   morphologically less developed and are strongly affected by human
   activities; radiocarbon ages and ceramic assemblages indicate that they
   belong to the Maya Classic and Postclassic periods. Stable carbon
   isotope values from the decalcified organic matter vary among paleosols
   of different ages and sites. 13C values are highest (16 to 20 parts per
   thousand) in the Formative period paleosol. Although it is possible that
   maize cultivation could contribute to the isotopic signatures, we
   believe that the 13C values indicate the dominance of drought-resistant
   C4 and CAM vegetation due to their association with vertic soils. The
   Classic period paleosol has a slightly lower isotopic value (20 to 22
   parts per thousand), while the Postclassic paleosol shows the lowest
   values (22 to 23 parts per thousand), suggesting reforestation of the
   floodplain. These results indicate that the Early Holocene paleosols
   formed in a humid climate similar to that of today, which transitions
   toward dryer conditions around 5500 cal. yr B.P. In the Late Holocene
   (approximately 3000 B.P.) an increase in seasonality occurs. This
   condition favored the formation of Vertisols, suitable for agriculture.

   hyoid outlined and epicoracoid cartilages slightly overlapped. The new
   species is characterized by an advertisement call composed of 6-46
   non-pulsed notes per call and dominant frequency of 4794 +/- 296 Hz,
   which supports an independent lineage. Additionally, the small size,
   body slender, toe tips knobbed with central groove, abdominal fold
   complete, tibio-tarsal articulation reaching the posterior border of the
   eye, and prepollex and prehallux composed of base and one element are
   character states that distinguish P. parnaiba from all the members of
   Pseudopaludicola. We provide its formal description with regard to
   external morphology, osteological characters and advertisement call.},

Title = {Gas-phase noncovalent functionalization of carbon nanotubes with a
   Ni(II) tetraaza{[}14]annulene complex},
Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {270},
Pages = {634-647},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The noncovalent functionalization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with
   aromatic polyazamacrocyclic compounds, based on pi-pi-interactions,
   keeps the intrinsic electronic structure of CNTs totally intact and
   allows for combining unique properties of the two interacting
   components. In addition to porphyrins and phthalocyanines, there are
   other, simpler compounds exhibiting similar properties, potentially
   useful for photovoltaic, catalytic and electrochemical applications: for
   example, tetraaza{[}14]annulenes. Many of them are highly thermally
   stable, which makes it possible to employ physical vapor deposition for
   the preparation of macrocycle-nanotube hybrids. One of such compounds is
   Ni(II) complex of
   5,7,12,14-tetramethyldibenzo-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-3,5,7,10,12
   ,14-hexaene (also called
   Ni(II)-tetramethyldibenzotetraaza{[}14]annulene, or NiTMTAA for
   simplicity). In the present work, we attempted the noncovalent
   functionalization of both single-walled and multi-walled CNTs with
   NiTMTAA in the gas phase at two selected temperatures of 220 and 270
   degrees C, which does not require the use of organic solvents and
   therefore can be considered as ecologically friendly. The nanohybrids
   obtained were characterized by means of scanning and transmission
   electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, Fourier-transform infrared
   and Raman spectroscopy, as well as thermogravimetric analysis. An
   additional insight into the structure of adsorption complexes of NiTMTAA
   on CNTs was provided from density functional theory and molecular
   mechanics calculations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Geochemical, mineralogical and microbiological data from four freshwater
   streams in central region of Mexico indicate the importance of
   Blennothrix ganeshii mats (Cyanobacteria, Oscillatoriales) in promoting
   the formation of calcium carbonate crystals. The streams were
   characterized by alkaline waters and relative physicochemical stability
   during three seasons (cold dry, warm dry and warm rainy). Calcification
   took the form of a thick, dense layer of calcium carbonate crystals
   surrounding the extracellular polymeric substances produced by B.
   ganeshii filaments, giving an appearance of micritic tubes (structures
   formed by crystallization in the spaces between filaments) along the
   sheath surfaces. The precipitate was analyzed using X-ray diffraction
   and energy dispersal X-ray spectrometry, and the calcite crystal habit
   was determined. The photosynthetic activity of cyanobacterial growth and
   the presence of abundant extracellular polymeric substances and
   epiphytic species promote the absorption of ions and mineral nucleation
   on the surface of the sediment and contribute to the formation of
   travertine in tropical regions.},

Title = {Magnetic behavior of the

   pyrochlore solid solution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {200},
Pages = {49-53},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the
   Bi2-ySryIr2O7 system was studied from 2 to 300 K. According to these
   measurements, the solid solution (0 <= y <= 0.9) does not show any
   magnetic transition; however, a noticeable deviation from the
   Curie-Weiss law occurs and the magnetic behavior of this system can be
   ascribed to short-range magnetic order that is also present in several
   geometrically frustrated systems. The Pauli magnetic susceptibility
   decreases as the Sr content increases, this can be associated with a
   shift towards Ir5+ in samples; also the Ir effective magnetic moment
   decreases. The estimated Wilson-ratio indicates the presence of strong
   electron-electron correlations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Structural transformations in magnetorheological slurries induced by
   perturbations},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The pattern formation produced by the aggregation of the particles in
   magnetorheological dispersions when they are in the presence of a static
   magnetic field, and the process of reconstruction of these structures
   induced by the application of magnetic perturbations, are investigated
   experimentally and theoretically. Under the influence of a static
   magnetic field the aggregation of the dispersed particles generates a
   multifractal structure, whose corresponding hierarchical structure has
   been characterized by means of its mass fractal dimensions and other
   correlations. When this system is perturbed by an oscillatory magnetic
   field, in addition to the static one, the dispersion rearranges
   becoming, for certain values of the amplitude and frequency of the
   perturbation, a more compact and relatively more ordered structure.
   Here, the analysis of these phenomena is approached as if the pattern
   formation were a kind of glassy transformation in a supercooled liquid,
   and the effect of the perturbation were an annealing process. The role
   of the temperature is taken here by the ratio of the intensities of the
   applied fields. From high resolution photographs taken at different
   stages of the structure evolution, it is possible to calculate some
   complexity measures such as the singularity spectrum, the lacunarity
   index, enthalpy and the configurational entropy. On this basis it is
   possible to describe quantitatively these glassy-like transformations.
   The relaxation time that distinguishes between a cooling process that
   leads the structure to a glassy or a crystalline one, is experimentally
   obtained.},

Title = {Replacement of Artemia franciscana Nauplii by Microencapsulated Diets:
   Effect on Development, Digestive Enzymes, and Body Composition of White

Abstract = {The effects of two microencapsulated feeds were evaluated on
   development, growth, survival, proteolytic activity, and biochemical
   composition of white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, larvae. The
   treatments were: (1) basal microcapsules (BM), (2) microcapsules
   containing krill hydrolysate (BMK), and (3) live food control (LFC:
   Artemia franciscana nauplii) with all treatments receiving algae
   (Chaetoceros ceratosporum and Tetraselmis chuii). No significant
   differences were found in development index and survival among larvae.
   Growth rate was significantly higher in larvae fed LFC (15 +/- 0.06\%/d)
   as compared with those offered the BM diet (7.5 +/- 0.5\%/d) with the
   BMK (11 +/- 0.04\%/d) treatment producing intermediate results. The
   activity of total proteases and chymotrypsin decreased significantly
   after Mysis I (MI) in larvae fed LFC or BMK. Protein content of larvae
   increased significantly toward PL1. The acylglycerides content in MIII
   fed on LFC (2.3 +/- 0.2\%/dw) was higher than that MI fed BM (1 +/-
   0.01\%/dw). No difference was observed in the cholesterol (CH) content
   of the larvae. The acylglycerides/protein and cholesterol/protein ratios
   showed a decreasing pattern between MI and PL1, indicating that these
   two ratios were related to ontogenetic shifts. These results demonstrate
   improvements in microparticulate diets when krill hydrolysates are
   included in the formulation.},

Title = {Comparing diversity data collected using a protocol designed for
   volunteers with results from a professional alternative},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {383-392},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In light of the continuing biodiversity crisis, the need for
   high-resolution, broad-scale ecological data is particularly acute. The
   expansive scale of volunteer data collection programmes provides an
   opportunity to address this challenge, however, protocols used to
   collect such data are typically less standardized than those used by
   professional scientists. Although previous studies have established that
   different protocols can lead to different results, it remains unclear
   how relevant these differences are to specific study goals, such as
   biodiversity assessment. This study uses both null model and Bayesian
   occupancy approaches to examine the capacity of a widely used volunteer
   survey protocol, the roving diver transect, to detect patterns of marine
   fish diversity. Richness estimates are compared with those obtained
   using the conventional belt transects favoured in many peer reviewed
   studies, examining the power of both protocols to detect statistically
   significant differences between survey sites and quantifying differences
   in detectability. Pairwise site comparisons of -diversity (i.e. within
   site diversity) were consistent between protocols, particularly for
   species totals. The roving diver transect protocol detected a
   substantially larger number of species than the belt transect protocol,
   due to notably higher detectability, even after controlling for
   confounding factors. Both protocols detected the same species pool,
   although the species richness among observations was higher for the belt
   protocol at certain sites. The significance of pairwise site -diversity
   (i.e. differentiation between sites) comparisons differed between the
   protocols and care should be exercised, when using either protocol, when
   studying variation in species composition. These results provide vital
   information for managers and researchers considering the use of
   volunteer data or protocols for the purpose of biodiversity assessment
   in aquatic systems, helping to quantify the value of thousands of
   existing survey records. The larger number of species detected by the
   volunteer protocol suggests this protocol may be advantageous with
   regards to the completion of taxonomic lists.},

Title = {Maxwell's equations in material media, momentum balance equations and
   force densities associated with them},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {128},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is common to take the Lorentz force density as a postulate
   independent of Maxwell's equations. Mansuripur (Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,
   193901 (2012)) does so, and applies it using the polarization charge and
   magnetization current. When he calculates forces and torques arising
   from a point charge and a magnetic dipole, in relative inertial motion,
   he arrives at the conclusion that the Lorentz force density is
   inconsistent with the principle of relativity. Following a line of
   research already developed (Eur. Phys. J. Plus 126, 50 (2011)) we show
   that the macroscopic Maxwell equations imply several energy and momentum
   stress balance equations, which, for point charges in empty space,
   reduce to the usual Lorentz force density. We show in this work that a
   force density appearing in one of these balance equations is that
   proposed by Einstein-Laub, which, according to Mansuripur, does not lead
   to an inconsistency with the theory of relativity. Thus we prove that
   there is no inconsistency with the relativity theory. These balance
   equations are as relativistic as Maxwell's equations.},

Abstract = {Tumor cells are known to secrete cytokines that modify their
   microenvironment in order to favor their survival and continuous
   proliferation. In this work, we evaluated if TGF-beta secreted in vitro
   by cervical cancer cells could interfere with the proliferation and
   survival of lymphocytes.
   Lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of healthy human
   volunteers, and isolated by density gradient centrifugation and cultured
   in 96-well plates. Lymphocyte proliferation was induced with
   phytohemaglutinin and co-cultured with conditioned media (CM) from
   cervical cancer cell lines, and the inhibition of proliferation was
   evaluated after 72 h by the incorporated radioactivity and a
   CFSE-labeling assay. TGF-beta quantification on these CM was evaluated
   by ELISA. Non-apoptotic cellular death was evaluated through disruption
   of cell membrane integrity by measuring the liberation of lactate
   dehydrogenase. The apoptosis process was evaluated by annexin-V and
   active caspase-3. The presence of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes was evaluated
   by flow cytometry using specific antibodies.
   It was found that the conditioned media from these cells significantly
   inhibited the proliferation of lymphocytes and induced them to go into
   apoptosis. Antibodies against TGF-beta almost completely blocked this
   activity, suggesting that this cytokine is responsible for the
   inhibitory activity. When the induced apoptosis on subpopulations of
   lymphocytes was evaluated, it was detected that the CD4+ cells were
   specifically targeted.
   Cervical cancer cells secrete TGF-beta that inhibits lymphocyte
   proliferation and induces apoptosis in CD4+, but not in CD8+
   lymphocytes.},

Abstract = {We introduce and develop an analogous of the Auslander-Buchweitz
   approximation theory (see Auslander and Buchweitz, Societe Mathematique
   de France 38:5-37, 1989) in the context of triangulated categories, by
   using a version of relative homology in this setting. We also prove
   several results concerning relative homological algebra in a
   triangulated category which are based on the behavior of certain
   subcategories under finiteness of resolutions and vanishing of
   Hom-spaces. For example: we establish the existence of preenvelopes (and
   precovers) in certain triangulated subcategories of The results resemble
   various constructions and results of Auslander and Buchweitz, and are
   concentrated in exploring the structure of a triangulated category
   equipped with a pair where is closed under extensions and omega is a
   weak-cogenerator in usually under additional conditions. This reduces,
   among other things, to the existence of distinguished triangles enjoying
   special properties, and the behavior of (suitably defined)
   (co)resolutions, projective or injective dimension of objects of and the
   formation of orthogonal subcategories. Finally, some relationships with
   the Rouquier's dimension in triangulated categories is discussed.},

   tetragonal. We also calculated the contributions of the dipolar magnetic
   energy to the magnetic anisotropy energy and found that in some cases,
   this contribution overcomes the magnetocrystalline part, determining
   thereby the easy axis direction. These results emphasize the importance
   and competition between both contributions in low dimensional systems.},

Abstract = {One of the great classical problems in theoretical seismology is
   Garvin's problem, which deals with the response of an elastic half-space
   subjected to a blast line source applied in its interior. However,
   Garvin (Exact transient solution of the buried line source problem.
   Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A 1956;528-541{[}4])
   himself provided only the solution for points on the free surface of the
   halfspace. Although a rigorous extension to points in the interior of
   the half-space was given nearly decade-and-a-half later by Alterman and
   Loewenthal (Algebraic expressions for the impulsive motion of an elastic
   half-space. Israel Journal of Technology 1969; 7 (6):495-504{[}1]),
   these scientists published their paper in a technical journal of rather
   restricted circulation, as a result of which their complete solution
   remained largely unnoticed by the geophysical and soil dynamics
   communities. This article revisits Garvin's generalized problem,
   presents a concise rendition and summary together with a very effective
   and accurate simplification, and examines the response characteristics
   for a pair of buried source-receiver location. It also includes a
   compact and very effective Matlab program for its evaluation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {The Campeche Bank, Gulf of Mexico, is a region with abundant coral reef
   ecosystems that haven't been studied despite providing goods and
   services to some human communities. This work presents the topography,
   coral community and conspicuous reef associated fauna of three reefs of
   this region: Sisal, Madagascar and Serpiente. Three-D models of reef
   topography were derived using a GPS-echo-sounder coupled with
   geostatistical methods. The coral community was assessed through
   composition, richness, density and size of the colonies. The size of the
   Sisal Reefs was bigger than other Gulf of Mexico reefs. Hard coral
   colonies presented an average diameter of 9 cm and an average density of
   9 colonies/m(2), whereas octocoral colonies averaged 11 cm in height and
   presented an average density of 24 colonies/m(2). We found 18 hard coral
   and 14 octocoral species, all of them distributed in the Atlantic Ocean;
   however, this work is the first to report Carijoa riseii and Phyllangia
   americana for the Mexican reefs of the Gulf of Mexico. The conspicuous
   fauna consisted in species with aquaculture potential (e.g. Octopus
   maya, Panulirus argus, Periclimenes pedersoni) and conservation priority
   (i.e. Eretmochelys imbricata). This study shows that these reefs are
   important centers of marine life and provides a baseline for future
   research.},

Abstract = {American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is caused by protozoan parasites
   of the Leishmania genus, and transmitted by females of the Phlebotominae
   family.
   The role of wild and domestic hosts in the cycle of Leishmania is still
   unknown.
   ACL is endemic in the province of Formosa where Nyssomyia neivai was the
   most abundant species in several captures and 31 cumulative ACL human
   cases were reported between 2005 and 2011 in the province.
   The present report describes the detection, by PCR-RFLP and confirmed by
   sequencing, of subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) DNA in four free-ranging
   owl monkeys (Aotus azarai azarai) from Formosa Province. The sequence
   amplified was the mini-exon gene present in tandem repeats in all
   species of the Leishmania genus from buffy coat samples. The absence of
   inhibitors in the samples was checked by a beta-globin protocol
   originally designed to amplify the human p-globin gene.
   However, other free-ranging primates were found with natural infections
   of L. (V) braziliensis complex and Leishmania (Viannia) subgenus by
   parasitological means in America. To the best of our knowledge, there
   are no published reports on detection of subgenus Leishmania (Viannia)
   DNA by PCR-RFLP in argentinean free-ranging primates.
   Additional eco-epidemiological and parasitological studies are necessary
   to confirm owl monkeys, or any other natural infected mammal species
   detected by PCR, as a reservoir, incidental host or to propose it as an
   animal model for research on this topic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Six genera of the tribe Phalacropsyllini were analysed based on
   molecular (18S rDNA and 28S rDNA) and morphological characters, using
   maximum parsimony analyses and Bayesian inference. The results support
   the paraphyly of the tribe Phalacropsyllini, as shown in a previous
   study based only on molecular characters. Three main clades were
   identified: one includes the genera Neopsylla, Epitedia, Catallagia, and
   Delotelis; another includes Phalacropsylla and Strepsylla; and a third
   one includes only Meringis. In order to propose a phylogenetic
   classification we recognize three tribes, transferring Epitedia,
   Catallagia and Delotelis to Neopsyllini; keeping Phalacropsyllini only
   for Phalacropsylla and Strepsylla; and proposing the new tribe Meringini

Abstract = {The main goal of this manuscript is the reevaluation of the taxonomic
   status of the teiid lizard Contomastix charrua, known only from Cabo
   Polonio, a small coastal rocky outcrop in southeastern Uruguay. This
   species was erected on the basis of the presence of a second pair of
   ceratobranchials and longer cornua in the hyoid bone, in addition to a
   reduced expression of the pattern of coloration as compared with C.
   lacertoides. Nevertheless, we found that both species have
   indistinguishable hyoid morphology, bearing C. lacertoides a noticeable
   second pair of ceratobranchials. Besides, we realized that the pattern
   of coloration in this species is more variable than previously
   considered. As a result of the present work, C. charrua is included in
   the synonymy of C. lacertoides. In addition, we provide some
   observations on the holotype of Cnemidophorus grandensis, a junior
   synonym of C. lacertoides.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We present a thorough analysis on the invariance of the most widely used
   metrics in the Geometrothermodynamics programme. We centre our attention
   in the invariance of the curvature of the space of equilibrium states
   under a change of fundamental representation. Assuming that the systems
   under consideration can be described by a fundamental relation which is
   a homogeneous function of a definite order, we demonstrate that such
   invariance is only compatible with total Legendre transformations in the
   present form of the programme. We give the explicit form of a metric
   which is invariant under total Legendre transformations and whose
   induced metric produces a curvature which is independent of the
   fundamental representation. Finally, we study a generic system with two
   degrees of freedom and whose fundamental relation is homogeneous of
   order one. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {Stability, and bifurcation analysis of a vector-bias model of malaria
   transmission},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {242},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-67},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The vector-bias model of malaria transmission, recently proposed by
   Chamchod and Britton, is considered. Nonlinear stability analysis is
   performed by means of the Lyapunov theory and the LaSalle Invariance
   Principle. The classical threshold for the basic reproductive number,
   R-0, is obtained: if R-0 > 1, then the disease will spread and persist
   within its host population. If R-0 < 1, then the disease will die out.
   Then, the model has been extended to incorporate both immigration and
   disease-induced death of humans. This modification has been shown to
   strongly affect the system dynamics. In particular, by using the theory
   of center manifold, the occurrence of a backward bifurcation at R-0 = 1
   is shown possible. This implies that a stable endemic equilibrium may
   also exists for R-0 < 1. When R-0 > 1, the endemic persistence of the
   disease has been proved to hold also for the extended model. This last
   result is obtained by means of the geometric approach to global
   stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We introduce a new microscopic model for alpha-cluster matter, which
   simulates the properties of ordinary nuclear matter and alpha-clustering
   in a curved surface of a large but finite nucleus. The model is based on
   a nested icosahedral fullerene-like multiple-shell structure, where each
   vertex is occupied by a microscopic alpha-particle. The novel aspect of
   this model is that it allows a consistent description of nuclear surface
   properties from microscopic parameters to be made without using the
   leptodermous expansion. In particular, we show that the calculated
   surface energy is in excellent agreement with the corresponding
   coefficient of the Bethe-Weizacker semi-empirical mass formula. We
   discuss the properties of the surface alpha-cluster state, which
   resembles an ultra cold bosonic quantum gas trapped in an optical
   lattice. By comparing the surface and interior states we are able to
   estimate the alpha preformation probability. Possible extensions of this
   model to study nuclear dynamics through surface vibrations and
   departures from approximate sphericity are mentioned.},

Abstract = {The structural complexity of the lignocellulosic materials hinders
   enzymatic hydrolysis for what their conversion to bioethanol requires a
   pretreatment step. The aim of this work was to optimize the pretreatment
   of rice hulls with diluted acid. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was
   used to obtain regression equations in function of the variables: acid
   concentration and heating time. Optimal conditions were obtained by the
   Desirability function. As a strategy to obtain the best solid material
   for the production of ethanol by fermentation minimizing sugars
   degradation, the optimization of the pretreatments was performed
   following three scenarios. The optimum was established as the conditions
   that maximize glucans in the solid and xylose in the liquid (0.3\% (w/v)
   of sulfuric acid and a 33 min). The pretreated rice hull in those
   conditions was treated enzymatically. The performance of the enzymatic
   hydrolysis was about 50\% (25\% of total sugars present) over a period
   of 48 h of reaction, and the efficiency of conversion of dissolved
   sugars to bioethanol was of 84\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Introduction. User's perception with regard to the attention they
   received in healthcare units is increasingly being taken into account by
   the health service providers in order to improve the quality of their
   service. Aim. Describe how the users perceive the health services
   provided by the CCINSHAE with regard to the communication with the
   physicians, the attention of the staff and the adverse personal and
   institutional experiences and to explore their relation with user's
   demographic characteristics, health condition, physical limitations to
   carry out daily activities and service area. Methods. A questionnaire
   was designed to collect information about the user and his/her opinion
   with regard to the healthcare units, the communication with the
   physicians, the attention of the staff and the adverse personal and
   institutional experiences. The data were analyzed with STATA using
   sample weights. Results. A total of 2,176 individuals were interviewed
   after they had received attention and represent a population of
   1,457,964 users, over 6 months, of the CCINSAHE. We then calculated four
   binary variables that reflect the perception of the users. These four
   variables were significantly associated with the type of health unit
   where the user received attention, schooling, limitations to carry out
   daily activities, facilities provided to the relatives, family income,
   the use of alternative medicine, and the area of attention. Discussion.
   A fundamental aspect of the service provided by the healthcare
   institutions is the communication between the physicians and the users.
   We found that the perception of the users with regard to the
   communication with the physician, the attention of the staff, and the
   adverse personal and institutional experiences was associated with the
   type of healthcare unit. The federal reference hospitals produced the
   most unfavorable perception while the regional hospitals produced the
   most favorable impression. This study enables the decision-making
   personnel to determine what needs to be modified in order to improve the
   service provided by the health units.},

Abstract = {The Lanaiaceae family is highly diverse in Mexico and it is distributed
   preferently in temperate zones, nevertheless it is possible find some
   genera such as Hyptis and Asterohyptis inhabitating dry and hot places.
   Lamiaceae is one of the most diverse families in the country, and there
   were no data about its diversity and endemism. In the current
   contribution a key to the genera of the family, their descriptions,
   commentaries about their richness and endemism, a map of the family
   distribution and a list of species in the country are presented; all the
   above based on a literature search, the revision of herbarium
   collections (CHAPA, CHIP, ENCB, FCME, IEB, MEXU, OAX, SERO y UAMIZ) and
   species lists available on the web (F, K, MO and US). In Mexico there
   are 32 native or naturalized for a long time genera and 591 species that
   represent 8.11\% of the family, with an endemism of 65.82\%.},

Abstract = {We studied the reproductive cycle of Sceloporus spinosus from Laguna La
   Preciosa, Puebla, Mexico, elevation 2,400 m. There was no sexual
   dimorphism in snout-vent length (males, 87.5 mm; females, 88.8 mm).
   Gonadal mass varied monthly and was related to snout-vent length; both
   sexes had a synchronous reproductive cycle that peaked in late winter
   and early spring. In males, recrudescence occurred November-January with
   abundant primary and secondary spermatocytes. Maximum testicular mass
   was in February when seminiferous tubules showed spermiogenesis and
   spermatozoa were in the lumen and epididymis. Regression was evident in
   April, when testicular mass decreased, and it continued in May, although
   spermatozoa were in seminiferous tubules and lumen of epididymal ducts.
   In July-September, testicular mass was less, and only spermatogonias,
   Sertoli cells, and remains of sperm were in seminiferous tubules. In
   females, vitellogenesis began in late autumn, maximum deposition of yolk
   was in March, and ovulation was in April. Oviductal eggs were present in
   April-June and oviposition was in June-July. In August-September, only
   previtellogenic and atretic follicles were present; hatchlings were
   present in September. Size of clutch was 6-17 eggs and correlated with
   snout-vent length. One clutch is produced per reproductive season.
   Reproductive activity in both sexes was distinct from spring-summer
   activity in tropical sceloporines from high elevations, but was similar
   to other lizards in northern temperate areas.},

Abstract = {We present an implementation of the numerical modeling of elastic waves
   propagation, in 2D anisotropic materials, using the new parallel
   computing devices (PCDs). Our study is aimed both to model laboratory
   experiments and explore the capabilities of the emerging PCDs by
   discussing performance issues. In the experiments a sample plate of an
   anisotropic material placed inside a water tank is rotated and, for
   every angle of rotation it is subjected to an ultrasonic wave (produced
   by a large source transducer) that propagates in the water and through
   the material producing some reflection and transmission signals that are
   recording by a ``point-like{''} receiver. This experiment is numerically
   modeled by running a finite difference code covering a set of angles
   theta is an element of {[}-50 degrees, 50 degrees], and recorded the
   signals for the transmission and reflection results. Transversely
   anisotropic and weakly orthorhombic materials are considered. We
   accelerated the computation using an open-source toolkit called
   PyOpenCL, which lets one to easily access the OpenCL parallel
   computation API's from the high-level programming environment of Python.
   A speedup factor over 19 using the GPU is obtained when compared with
   the execution of the same program in parallel using a CPU multi-core (in
   this case we use the 4-cores that has the CPU). The performance for
   different graphic cards and operating systems is included together with
   the full 2-D finite difference code with PyOpenCL. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {We studied patterns of geographic variation in the fine structural
   characteristics of the songs of five recognized subspecies of Common
   Bush Tanagers (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) in Mesoamerica to examine
   whether songs vary with geography. Multivariate analyses (PCA and DFA),
   based on 11 fine structural characteristics of the songs provided
   similar results indicating that both albifrons and regionalis had unique
   songs significantly different from the rest of the subspecies.
   Conversely, ophthalmicus, dwighti, and postocularis had similar song
   characteristics, regardless of restricted gene flow and substantial
   morphological variation reported in previous studies. Our findings
   suggest there is a possible relationship between the length of isolation
   and variation in songs of albifrons and regionalis, whereas the lack of
   divergence in songs of ophthalmicus, dwighti, and postocularis suggests
   some of these forms have not diverged vocally, and vocal traits may be
   evolutionary conserved. Received 27 March 2012. Accepted 27 September

Abstract = {Nectar of hummingbird-pollinated plants is usually robbed by
   non-pollinator animals, for that reason it is possible that the robbed
   plants show different strategies to mitigate the associated costs. In
   this study, we evaluated the production of nectar and flowers as traits
   to mitigate the nectar robbing in the distylous plant Bouvardia
   ternifolia (Rubiaceae) in the National Park La Malinche, Tlaxcala.
   Plants of both morphs were subject to three different treatments: (1)
   treatment with nectar removal, (2) treatment without nectar removal, and
   (3) treatment control. During the flowering period, we weekly quantified
   the nectar volume (15 flowers/plant) and the number of flowers per
   plant. We manually pollinated the focal flowers and the produced fruits
   were collected and their seeds counted. Similar volumes of nectar were
   produce in the flowers with and without nectar removal; in opposition to
   the small collected volumes in the control flowers. Long-styled flowers
   (pin morph) produced more nectar volume and sugar than short-styled
   flowers (thrum morph). There was not effect of treatments on the flowers
   production in both morphs. Flowers with and without nectar removal
   produced more seeds than control flowers. Our results showed that
   Bouvardia can over-compensate the nectar robbed, but not flowers;
   without affecting the number produced seeds.},

Abstract = {Some water bodies in karst environments of the Yucatan peninsula are
   rich in tropical species of cyanoprokaryote metaphyton. We present
   species of Chroococcales and Oscillatoriales from seven different
   families and identify 14 new records for Mexico where four are described
   as new species (Asterocapsa xcaamalensis, Chlorogloea halkab,
   Cyanosarcina caribeana, and Synechococcus socialis). The unique
   ecological conditions of alkaline wetlands at varying depth levels
   appear to promote richness of Cyanoprokaryota, an important group
   representative of the biodiversity in the peninsula. The area is part of
   the Caribbean subregion and is included among the 25 key sites of
   diversity worldwide. Of the species documented in this study, 82\% have
   been recorded in the literature for this subregion and half of these
   species have a circumscribed distribution to the Caribbean.},

Abstract = {A new process for synthesizing rhodium (Rh) nano-particles by sol-gel
   processing using acrylamide and microwaves is reported and discussed.
   Three heat treatments were applied: the first required the use of
   microwaves, with an inert gas (Ar) flux, to decompose the organic
   material; the second and third treatments, respectively, were carried
   out into a furnace in air at temperatures of 600 and 1,000 A degrees C.
   This procedure ensured the removal of by-products produced during the
   sol-gel reaction. The synthesis of a pure nano-Rh was confirmed by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), where the presence of a cubic structure was observed
   (PDF file 089-7383), and EDX. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in
   addition to determining the decomposition temperatures, enabled the heat
   treatment conditions needed to obtain pure nano- Rh to be elucidated.
   Furthermore, the morphology was observed with a scanning electron
   microscope (SEM). After the heat treatment at 1,000 A degrees C, SEM
   images showed grain sizes between 3 and 200 nm. High-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) confirmed the production of
   those nano- particles, and the beginning of the formation of clusters as
   a consequence of the high temperature applied to the system.},

   Furthermore, we show an uncountable family of pairwise non-homeomorphic,

   that their hyperspaces of subcontinua are not g-contractible either. (C)

Abstract = {We investigate the electronic and vibrational densities of states (eDOS
   and vDOS, respectively) of nanoporous carbon (np-C) simulationally
   obtained from a crystalline diamond-like supercell with 216 atoms and a
   crystalline graphite-like supercell with 256 atoms. The nanoporous
   structures were generated by an ab initio molecular dynamics process at
   constant temperature (1000 K) using a density functional code based on
   the Harris functional, following the procedure implemented by Valladares
   et al. {[}1]. The resulting samples are essentially amorphous and their
   pore sizes fall within the nanometer length scale. The study of total
   and partial eDOS shows a dominant presence of sp(2) hybridization in
   both models and also shows systems without a gap. In the calculated vDOS
   an extended spectrum around 300 meV is observed and a clear separation
   of acoustic and optical modes appears. The eDOS and vDOS obtained are
   compared to those for amorphous samples, since no experimental
   determinations for porous materials were found. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Uniqueness of the Fock quantization of scalar fields under mode
   preserving canonical transformations varying in time},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {We study the Fock quantization of scalar fields of Klein-Gordon type in
   nonstationary scenarios propagating in spacetimes with compact spatial
   sections, allowing for different field descriptions that are related by
   means of certain nonlocal linear canonical transformations that depend
   on time. More specifically, we consider transformations that do not mix
   eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which are supposed to be
   dynamically decoupled. In addition, we assume that the canonical
   transformations admit an asymptotic expansion for large eigenvalues (in
   norm) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the form of a series of half
   integer powers. Canonical transformations of this kind are found in the
   study of scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmologies, relating, for
   instance, the physical degrees of freedom of these perturbations after
   gauge fixing with gauge-invariant canonical pairs of Bardeen quantities.
   We characterize all possible transformations of this type and show that,
   independently of the initial field description, the combined criterion
   of requiring (i) invariance of the vacuum under the spatial symmetries
   and (ii) a unitary implementation of the dynamics leads to a unique
   equivalence class of Fock quantizations, all of them related by unitary
   transformations. This conclusion provides even further robustness to the
   validity of the proposed criterion, completing the results that have
   already appeared in the literature about the uniqueness of the Fock
   quantization under changes of field description when one permits
   exclusively local time-dependent canonical transformations that scale
   the field configuration. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.044013},

Title = {CARBON STORAGE IN MONTANE CLOUD FORESTS IN SIERRA NORTE OF OAXACA,

Abstract = {One of the principal uncertainties regarding the function of the
   tropical and subtropical forests within the global carbon cycle is due
   to the lack of information of the capacity of these ecosystems to
   accumulate carbon (C). In the case of the montane cloud forests, the
   wide environmental heterogeneity to which they are subjected determines
   important changes in their structural and floristic composition, which
   could affect the C contents stored in their different components. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the C content in the above and
   below ground storage for five communities of montane cloud forest in the
   Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, situated between 1500 and 2500 m altitude. The
   design was hierarchic nested sampling and the variables were C in the
   arboreal biomass, herbaceous and shrub stratum, dead woody material,
   humus, fine roots and mineral soil for each plant community. The sum of
   the different stores indicated that the accumulated C was higher than
   1500 and 2500 m (440 and 420 Mg ha(-1)), and between 1950 and 2400 m it
   was 354 Mg ha(-1). the average, the carbon reserve in biomass and soil
   for the montane cloud forests was 384.16 +/- 40.13 Mg ha(-1). The
   conformation of these stores is regulated by the biophysical variations
   within the attitudinal interval, translated in floristic and structural
   changes of the vegetation, in the production and preservation of scantly
   transformed organic residue on the soil surface, as well as its capacity
   to form organo mineral associations that estabilize organic carbon in
   the soil.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of continuous exposure
   to sublethal ammonia concentrations upon the characteristics of the
   locomotor activity rhythms in Uca princeps, exposed to artificial tides
   and light cycles. Adult male crabs were used for standardized 24 h
   ammonia acute toxicity tests. Sublethal ammonia concentrations were
   selected considering the results obtained in the acute bioassays as well
   as the unusual high ammonia concentrations registered in their natural
   habitat. Three independent groups of eight crabs each were exposed
   during 1520 days to 0.125, 3.5, and 18 mg N-TA/L in artificial sea
   water. Locomotor activity was recorded individually by means of infrared
   light crossings. Artificially created tidal and lightdark cycles were
   used along the experiments. The 24 h-LC50 was 186.02 mg N-TA/L. No
   mortality was registered in the crabs exposed to the sublethal ammonia
   concentrations. In control groups, organisms showed tidal activity onset
   mainly in low tide (ebb) and no response to light cycles while ammonia
   exposed crabs shifted their onset of activity to high tide, and a
   general increasing activity was observed along the experiment. The
   obtained results indicate that ammonia affects the entraining features
   of the tidal activity rhythm and demonstrate that under ammonia
   sublethal exposure, tides may present relative coordination with light
   cycles in the tidal activity rhythm of the crabs.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {64},
Pages = {220-231},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this work, the transient heating of a fluid inside a vertical cavity
   of large aspect ratio (height/length) was studied numerically by the use
   of the SIMPLE algorithm. The heat sources are two vertical plates
   localized in the side walls of the cavity near the bottom. Calculations
   were performed for a fixed value of the Prandtl number, Pr = 7, aspect
   ratio of 12 and six different Rayleigh numbers between 10(3) and 10(6).
   The temperature and entropy production fields, the non-dimensional heat
   flux on the heated plates (given by the average Nusselt number) have
   been obtained. From a clear dependence on the Rayleigh number, different
   mechanisms of symmetry break and heat transfer in the cavity were found,
   where vortices dynamics play a very important role. A universal behavior
   of the mean values of the overall reduced entropy production rate was
   found, valid after a short initial transient. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {This paper describes the development of the sexual phase of the invasive
   fern, Pteridium caudatum, from spore germination to young sporophyte
   formation. Spores samples for gametophyte cultures were taken from
   various sporophytes and then sown on mineral agar with Thompson's media.
   Gametophytes were maintained under fluorescent light on a 12 h light, 12
   h dark cycle at 24-25 degrees C. Developmental phases were fixed in
   FAA-sucrose solution and processed for observation with the scanning
   electron microscope. Spores are trilete and germination takes place on
   the second day after sowing; germination is of the Vittaria-type.
   Adiantum-type prothallial development was observed. The differentiation
   of a two-dimensional thallus begins 5 days after germination maturation
   of adult gametophytes occurs about 30 days after sowing. Adult
   gametophytes are heart-shaped, bisexual and glabrous. Antheridia are
   formed by three cells: basal, annular and opercular cell with a pore.
   Archegonia have a neck of 4-cells. The young sporophyte becomes visible
   within 8 weeks after spores are sown. The taxonomic significance of the
   gametophyte morphology is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Nonlinear dynamics of heart rate variability in response to orthostatism

Abstract = {We studied the response of heart rate variability to hemodialysis and
   orthostatism using traditional linear indexes and 9 recurrence
   quantification analysis indexes to reveal changes in the heart rate
   dynamics. Twenty healthy subjects and 19 chronic renal failure patients
   treated with hemodialysis thrice a week were included. Five-minute heart
   rate variability time series were obtained during supine position
   (clinostatism) and orthostatism from each participant; recordings in
   renal patients were repeated after hemodialysis. Linear indexes were
   consistent with sympathetic predominance in response to orthostatism in
   the control group. Renal patients before hemodialysis showed increased
   sympathetic predominance in clinostatism, with further increase in
   orthostatism and hemodialysis. In response to orthostatism, 4 recurrence
   indexes changed in the control group, while in renal patients any of
   them changed before hemodialysis and 1 changed after hemodialysis. In
   clinostatism, renal patients (both before and after hemodialysis) had
   higher laminarity, trapping time, and recurrence time than the control
   group. Recurrence indexes showed that the heart rate dynamics in renal
   patients are different from healthy subjects, suggesting loss of access
   to some regulatory conditions. These findings are consistent with
   reports of sympathetic stimulation induced by hemodialysis and active
   standing. (c) 2012 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We examined statistical correlations between the frequencies of seven
   proposed nucleosome positioning motifs and the densities of repetitive
   sequences in the human genome. For both parametric and non-parametric
   measures of statistical correlations there is a tendency for repetitive
   sequence density to be negatively correlated with the density of
   R/Y-based nucleosome positioning motifs, while being positively
   correlated with that of W/S-based motifs. These results largely hold
   even when motifs are examined only within repeat-filtered sequences. The
   RRRRRYYYYY motif and its 5-base shift YYYYYRRRRR, in particular, is
   over-represented in the human genome; and its negative correlation is
   consistently present at different regions and at different length
   scales. For some other nudeosome positioning motifs, the relationship
   with repeats can be regional or length scale dependent. Considering the
   importance of nucleosome formation in epigenetic regulations, these
   results may provide new insight to the evolution of repetitive
   sequences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Castration-Induced Modifications of GnRH-Elicited
   {[}Ca2+]i Signaling Patterns in Male Mouse
   Pituitary Gonadotrophs In Situ: Studies in the Acute Pituitary Slice
   Preparation},

Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) binds to pituitary gonadotroph
   receptors and initiates {[}Ca2+](i) signals and gonadotropin secretion.
   Here, we recorded GnRH-induced Ca2+ signals in acute pituitary slices
   from both intact and castrated male mice 15 and 45 days after
   orchiectomy (GnX). Cells responding with ``noncanonical{''} sequences of
   Ca2+ signaling to increasing GnRH concentrations ({[}GnRH]; oscillatory
   responses at a given {[}GnRH] and transient responses at both lower and
   higher concentrations) were augmented significantly in the castrated
   mice. Also, 15 days after GnX the number and size of gonadotrophs were
   augmented, confirming earlier anatomical studies. Hypertrophied
   gonadotrophs after 15 days after GnX tended to display GnRH-induced Ca2+
   responses of greater amplitude. Furthermore, median effective dose
   (ED50) for GnRH decreased from 0.17 nM (control) to; similar to 0.07 nM
   after GnX, suggesting increased GnRH responsiveness of the gonadotroph
   population. The progression of Ca2+ response patterns reported in
   control male rat gonadotrophs (oscillations declining and spike-plateau
   responses dominating at increasing {[}GnRH]) was less conspicuous in
   mouse gonadotrophs in situ. Also, GnX-induced alterations in rat
   gonadotrophs (persistence of Ca2+ oscillations even at {[}GnRH] >100 nM)
   were not mirrored by mouse gonadotrophs in situ. Contrary to
   observations in intact and 15-day castrated mice, after 45 days of GnX
   the hump component diminished and oscillations were augmented with
   increasing {[}GnRH], but Ca2+ response patterns of gonadotrophs in situ
   remained virtually unchanged in response to {[}GnRH] s >1 nM, suggesting
   dose discrimination failure at high {[}GnRH] s. This study underscores
   the notion that GnRH responsiveness and the effects of testosterone
   deficiency may not be equal in pituitary gonadotrophs across species.},

Title = {Thermal photon production in a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Photons produced in heavy ion collisions escape from the surrounding
   medium virtually unperturbed by it, thus representing an excellent probe
   of the conditions at the emission point. Using the gauge/gravity
   duality, we calculate the rate of photon production in an anisotropic,
   strongly coupled N = 4 plasma with N-f << N-c quark flavors. We consider
   arbitrary orientations of the photon momentum with respect to the
   anisotropic direction, as well as arbitrary values of the anisotropy. We
   present results for the correlation functions of two electromagnetic
   currents and for the electric conductivity. These quantities can be
   larger or smaller than the isotropic ones, depending on the direction of
   propagation and polarization of the photons. The total production rate
   is however always larger than the isotropic one, independently of the
   frequency, direction of propagation, and value of the anisotropy.},

Abstract = {We present a study of time-delay effects on a two-actor conflict model
   based on nonlinear differential equations. The state of each actor
   depends on its own state in isolation, its previous state, its inertia
   to change, the positive or negative feedback and a time delay in the
   state of the other actor. We use both theoretical and numerical
   approaches to characterize the evolution of the system for several
   values of time delays. We find that, under particular conditions, a time
   delay leads to the appearance of oscillations in the states of the
   actors. Besides, phase portraits for the trajectories are presented to
   illustrate the evolution of the system for different time delays.
   Finally, we discuss our results in the context of social conflict
   models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An indigenous microalga was isolated from the springs in Cuatro
   Cienegas, Mexico. It was morphologically identified as Scenedesmus
   obtusiusculus and cultivated in bubble-column photobioreactors in batch
   operation mode. This microalga grows at 10\% of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   showing a maximum CO2 fixation rate of 970 g m(-3) d(-1). The microalga,
   without any nutrient limitation, contained 20\% of nonpolar lipids with
   a biomass productivity of 500 g m(-3) d(-1) and a maximum biomass
   concentration of around 6,000 g m(-3) at 5\% CO2 and irradiance of 134
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Furthermore, it was observed that the microalga
   stored 55.7\% of nonpolar lipids when 5\% CO2 was fed at 0.8 vvm and
   54.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) under nitrogen starvation. The lipid profile
   included C16:0, C18:0, C18:1n9t, C18:1n9c, C18:3n6 with a productivity
   of 200 g lipid m(-3) d(-1). Therefore, the microalga may have
   biotechnological potential producing lipids for biodiesel. (C) 2012

Title = {Thermoregulatory behavior and oxygen consumption of Octopus mimus
   paralarvae: The effect of age},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {86-91},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Octopus mimus is an important cephalopod species in the coastal zone of
   Peru and Chile that is exposed to temperature variations from time to
   time due to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes when surface
   temperatures can reach 24 degrees C, 6 degrees C above typical
   temperatures in their habitat. The relationships between temperature and
   food availability are important factors that determine the recruitment
   of juveniles into the O. mimus population. The present study was to
   evaluate the relationship between thermoregulatory behavior and the age
   of paralarvae (summer population) to determine whether changes in this
   behavior occur during internal yolk consumption, making larvae more
   vulnerable to environmental temperature change. Oxygen consumption of
   paralarvae when 1-4 d old was determined to establish if respiration
   could be used to monitor the physiological changes that occur during
   yolk consumption. Horizontal thermal selection (17-30 degrees C),
   critical thermal maxima (CTMax), minima (CTMin), and oxygen consumption
   experiments were conducted with fasting paralarvae 1-4 d old at 20
   degrees C. Preferred temperatures were dependent on the age of O. mimus
   paralarvae. One day old paralarvae selected a temperature 1.1 degrees C
   (23.4 degrees C) higher than 2 - 4 d old paralarvae (22.3 degrees C).
   The CTMax of paralarvae increased with age with values of 31.9 +/- 1.1
   degrees C in 1-d-olds and 33.4 +/- 0.3 to 4-d-olds. CTMin also changed
   with age with low values in 2-d-old paralarvae (9.1 +/- 1.3 degrees C)
   and 11.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C in 4-d-old animals. The temperature tolerance
   range of paralarvae was age-dependent (TTD=difference between CTMax and
   CTMin) with higher values in 2 and 3 d old paralarvae (25-26 degrees C)
   as compared to 1 d old (23.1 degrees C) and 4 d old animals (22.7
   degrees C). Oxygen consumption was not affected by the age of
   paralarvae, suggesting that mechanisms exist that compensate their
   metabloism until at least 4 d of age. The temperature tolerance range of
   a planktonic paralarvae of octopus species is presented for the first
   time. This range was dependent on the age of paralarvae, and so rendered
   the paralarvae more vunerable to a combination of high temperature and
   food deprivation during first days of life. Results in the present study
   provide evidence that O. mimus could be under ecological pressure if a
   climate change causes increased or decreased temperatures into their
   distribution range. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {About matter and dark-energy domination eras in Rn
   gravity or lack thereof},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {We provide further numerical evidence which shows that R-n models in
   f(R) metric gravity produce a late time acceleration in the Universe or
   a matter domination era (usually a transient one) but not both. Our
   results confirm the findings of Amendola et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
   131302 (2007); Phys. Rev. D 75, 083504 (2007); Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 16,
   1555 (2007)], but using a different approach that avoids the mapping to
   scalar-tensor theories of gravity, and therefore, spares us from any
   discussion or debate about frames (Einstein vs Jordan) which are endemic
   in this subject. This class of models has been used extensively in the
   literature as an alternative to dark energy, but should be considered
   ruled out for being inconsistent with the observations. Finally, we
   discuss a caveat in the analysis by Faraoni {[}Phys. Rev. D 83, 124044
   (2011)], which was used to further constrain these models by using a
   chameleon mechanism. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.024029},

   leaves in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {This study confirms the hypoglycemic effects of two extracts obtained
   from the Bromelia plumieri (BP) plant in
   streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats (STZ-NA). BP has been
   traditionally used in the municipality of Tlanchinol Hidalgo, Mexico, to
   treat type 2 diabetes. Two different BP extracts were prepared and
   tested. The first extract was a water extract (WE), similar to that
   traditionally used to make tea, and the second extract was an
   ethanol:water extract (EWE). The extracts (WE at 35 and 350 mg/kg, and
   EWE at 30 and 300 mg/kg) were tested in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats to
   determine whether hypoglycemia occurred after oral administration of the
   extracts. Phytochemistry: Two different extracts were prepared, n-hexane
   and butanol, to determine the presence of alkaloids, terpenes and
   flavonoids. The extracts that were administered to the STZ-NA-induced
   diabetic rats produced a significant hypoglycemic effect as compared
   with the control group, similar to that achieved with glibenclamide. We
   also determined that flavonoids were the main components of BP leaves.
   The results presented here support the hypothesis that extracts obtained
   from this plant have hypoglycemic effects, which are in agreement with
   the traditional uses of this plant.},

Title = {Affine group acting on hyperspaces of compact convex subsets of

Journal = {FUNDAMENTA MATHEMATICAE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {223},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-136},
Abstract = {For every n >= 2, let cc(R-n) denote the hyperspace of all nonempty
   compact convex subsets of the Euclidean space R-n endowed with the
   Hausdorff metric topology. Let cb(R-n) be the subset of cc(R-n)
   consisting of all compact convex bodies. In this paper we discover
   several fundamental properties of the natural action of the affine group
   Aff(n) on cb(R-n). We prove that the space E(n) of all n-dimensional
   ellipsoids is an Aff(n)-equivariant retract of cb(R-n). This is applied
   to show that cb(R-n) is homeomorphic to the product Q x Rn(n+3)/2, where
   Q stands for the Hilbert cube. Furthermore, we investigate the action of
   the orthogonal group O(n) on cc(R-n). In particular, we show that if K
   subset of O(n) is a closed subgroup that acts nontransitively on the
   unit sphere Sn-1, then the orbit space cc(R-n)/K is homeomorphic to the
   Hilbert cube with a point removed, while cb(R-n)/K is a contractible
   Q-manifold homeomorphic to the product (E(n)/K) x Q. The orbit space
   cb(R-n)/Aff(n) is homeomorphic to the BanachMazur compactum BM(n), while
   cc(R-n)/O(n) is homeomorphic to the open cone over BM(n).},

Abstract = {Let X be a Hausdorff topological group and G a locally compact subgroup
   of X. We show that X admits a locally finite sigma-discrete
   G-functionally open cover each member of which is G-homeomorphic to a
   twisted product G x (H) S-i, where H is a compact large subgroup of G
   (i.e., the quotient G/H is a manifold). If, in addition, the space of
   connected components of G is compact and X is normal, then X itself is
   G-homeomorphic to a twisted product G x (K) S, where K is a maximal
   compact subgroup of G. This implies that X is K-homeomorphic to the
   product G/K x S, and in particular, X is homeomorphic to the product R-n
   x S, where n = dim G/K. Using these results we prove the inequality dim
   X <= dim X/G + dim G for every Hausdorff topological group X and a

Title = {Biogeographical patterns of the ferns from Cordoba Hills (Argentina) and
   their implications in conservation},
Journal = {GAYANA BOTANICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-376},
Abstract = {Biogeographic atlases are the synthesis of distributional patterns
   represented by individual and generalized tracks, nodes, areas of
   endemism and area cladograms. They may help propose areas for
   conservation. Ferns are indicators of the quality of habitats and are
   especially useful for establishing biogeographic patterns due to their
   lack of coevolutionary relationships with biotic vectors, as well as
   their monophyly and morphological conservatism. Our aim was to apply a
   track analysis and a parsimony analysis of endemicity to the fern flora
   of the Cordoba Hills (77 taxa) in order to contribute to the
   Biogeographic Atlas of central Argentina. The established distributional
   pattern shows the closer relationships of the fern flora of central
   Argentina with the Subandean Hills, Peruvian and Ecuadorian Andes,
   Buenos Aires Hills and southern Brazil, corresponding to the ``Serranean
   Peripampasic Arch{''}. The protection of a rich and complex geographic
   area, with both endemic and widespread taxa, guarantees the preservation
   of conditions where the taxa develop. In this way, Cordoba Hills are a
   priority area for conservation, since they constitute a node or complex
   biogeographic area, with a remarkable fern richness of different
   historic origins, being a biotic convergence area.},

Abstract = {The ``complex thinking{''} is located within the epistemological debate
   that denies the separation between hard and soft sciences, which raises
   the need to articulate knowledge and ethics, which considers
   reductionist thinking,, which proposed a paradigm that can distinguish
   without dismantling to distinguish, identify and associate without
   reducing, as opposed to the principles of rule of disjunction and
   reduction that has prevailed since the seventeenth century, and it calls
   the ``paradigm of simplification{''} which certainly has allowed the
   progress of scientific knowledge held the twentieth century, but through
   the tissue fragments hyper complex realities
   Based on the above, this paper aims to determine how a graduate student
   in economic and administrative sciences at National Autonomous
   University of Mexico (UNAM) perceive that their teachers are including
   their program contents The seven complex lesson: detecting error and
   illusion, the principles of pertinent knowledge, teaching the human
   condition, earth identity, confronting uncertainties, teaching
   understanding of each other, ethics for the humane genre of mankind.
   Also, a validated instrument was designed through a Cronbach's Alpha
   which makes measurement scales are reliable variables taking a simple
   384 students from a population of 1500 enrolled in graduate student
   economic and administrative sciences in UNAM, applied a simple random
   sampling for a finite population at confidence level of 95\% and with
   error probability of .05. Similarly we measured the relationship between
   the seven complex lessons of Edgar Morin and the four pillars of
   education proposed by United Nations Organization for Education Science
   and Culture (UNESCO)},

Abstract = {Those species belonging to the order Gomphales (Fungi: Basidiomycota)
   are widely distributed, but most of them have been recorded in temperate
   areas of the northern hemisphere. This study presents the current
   knowledge and importance of this taxon in Mexico. Herbarium records,
   published works, institutional databases and personal collections in
   Mexico show that this order is represented in the country by 10 genera
   and 92 species, which chiefly inhabit temperate montane forests,
   although it is also represented at low altitudes. Traditionally, more
   than half of the species have a nutritional value among the different
   ethnic groups that inhabit Mexico. It is also known that many of the
   species are ectomycorrhizal. In comparison with other groups of
   Basidiomycota, there is little taxonomic knowledge about the species of
   this order, due chiefly to the lack of specialists on the group.
   Conservation of the members of this order is important for maintaining
   the delicate balance of temperate Mexican forests, mainly coniferous
   ones, which require association with fungi for their survival.},

Title = {DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A SOLID-PHASE RADIOIMMUNOASSAY FOR
   MEASURING PROGESTERONE AND TESTOSTERONE IN OCTOPUS GONAD EXTRACTS},
Journal = {MALACOLOGIA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {121-134},
Abstract = {Commercially available radioimmunoassays (RIA) with I-125-labeled
   hormones were adapted, developed and validated to quantify progesterone
   and testosterone in gonad extracts of Octopus maya, considered an easily
   domesticated species with potential in aquaculture. Development of the
   RIAs was divided into four phases: (1) extraction of progesterone and
   testosterone from gonads, (2) preparation of gonad extracts for RIA, (3)
   standards preparation, and (4) RIA procedure. Hormones were extracted
   twice with 15 mL of diethyl-ether each time. The recovered hormone and
   the solvent effect on extraction were evaluated. RIAs were validated
   based on specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision and
   reproducibility. Serially diluted gonad extracts were parallel to the
   standard curves of each hormone, indicating specificity. Sensitivities
   for both hormones were less than 0.1 ng.g(-1), and did not change by
   more than 20\% during the 1251 half-life. Accuracy was 102.25 +/-
   11.22\% for progesterone and 81.62 +/- 6.24\% for testosterone. For both
   hormones, precision was close to 13\% and reproducibility 17\%. The
   precision/reproducibility ratio indicated a system with good stability.
   The amounts of the hormones recovered increased when the number of
   extractions was increased. Hormone concentrations also increased when
   the volume of diethyl-ether used per extraction was increased. The range
   of progesterone and testosterone concentrations quantified in this study
   is in agreement with the range found in other octopuses. Finally, the
   developed and validated RIAs meet the requirements for quantification of
   progesterone and testosterone in Octopus gonad extracts and show that it
   is possible to use I-125-labeled hormone as well as the plastic
   coated-tubes from commercial RIA kits to analyse variations in hormone
   levels associated with gonad developmental stages and the reproductive
   cycle of octopuses, allowing exploration of their possible functions.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the island of Jaina, Campeche, red and yellow pigmented bones have
   been found. The study of the yellow and red colors in these burials is
   important for their possible interpretation, either religious,
   intentional coloring, or to understand taphonomic processes such as
   reactions of the original pigments with other compounds. Yellow color on
   bones is unusual in prehispanic burials.
   In this work, the red bones are shown to be pigmented with cinnabar as
   mentioned for tombs of important Mayan rulers. The yellow pigment is
   mainly constituted by Fe as shown by X-ray fluorescence. It was
   identified to be goethite (iron hydroxide) by electron diffraction. By
   scanning electron microscopy, the thickness of the pigment layer was
   measured to be ca. 5 microns. Note that hematite iron oxide is red and
   that it turns out to be yellow with hydroxylation. Hence, it seems that
   the nowadays yellow bones were originally red; indeed, yellow goethite
   may be the result of red hematite hydroxylation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {The conservation status of the world's reptiles},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {372-385},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information
   about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as
   the distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of
   reptilian diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means
   of gaining rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order
   to highlight urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy
   with appropriate biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present
   the first ever global analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on
   a random representative sample of 1500 species (16\% of all currently
   known species). To our knowledge, our results provide the first analysis
   of the global conservation status and distribution patterns of reptiles
   and the threats affecting them, highlighting conservation priorities and
   knowledge gaps which need to be addressed urgently to ensure the
   continued survival of the world's reptiles. Nearly one in five reptilian
   species are threatened with extinction, with another one in five species
   classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of threatened reptile species
   is highest in freshwater environments, tropical regions and on oceanic
   islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical areas, such as
   Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial reptiles. Our
   results emphasise the need for research attention to be focussed on
   tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of habitat
   loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of data,
   and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may
   currently be underestimated due to lack of population information.
   Conservation actions specifically need to mitigate the effects of
   human-induced habitat loss and harvesting, which are the predominant
   threats to reptiles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Aqueous Extract of Annona macroprophyllata: A Potential
   α-Glucosidase Inhibitor},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {Annona genus contains plants used in folk medicine for the treatment of
   diabetes. In the present study, an aqueous extract prepared from Annona
   macroprophyllata (Annonaceae, also known as A. diversifolia) leaves was
   evaluated on both the activity of yeast alpha-glucosidase (an in vitro
   assay) and sucrose tolerance in Wistar rats. The results have shown that
   the aqueous extract from A. macroprophyllata inhibits the yeast
   alpha-glucosidase with an IC50 = 1.18 mg/mL, in a competitive manner
   with K-i = 0.97 mg/mL, a similar value to that of acarbose (K-i = 0.79
   mg/mL). The inhibitory activity of A. macroprophyllata was reinforced by
   its antihyperglycemic effect, at doses of 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg in
   rats. Chromatographic analysis identified the flavonoids rutin and
   isoquercitrin in the most polar fractions of A. macroprophyllata crude
   extract, suggesting that these flavonoids are part of the active
   constituents in the plant. Our results support the use of A.
   macroprophyllata in Mexican folk medicine to control postprandial
   glycemia in people with diabetes mellitus, involving active constituents
   of flavonoid nature.},

Pages = {287-316},
Abstract = {A space X is arc-smooth at a point p provided there exists a continuous
   function a : X -> C(X) satisfying the following conditions: (1) a(p) =
   \{p\}; (2) for each x epsilon X \textbackslash{} \{p\}, the set alpha(x)
   is an arc from p to x; (3) if x E alpha(y), then alpha(x) subset of
   alpha(y). A space is arc-smooth if it is arcsmooth at some point p. In
   this paper we prove that, among hereditarily unicoherent continua, X is
   arc-smooth if and only if the nth symmetric product F-n(X) is arc-smooth
   for each n epsilon N. This allows us to give a positive answer to a
   question by J.T.Goodykoontz when we replace the hyperspace of
   subcontinua of a continuum X with F-n(X). We also give a
   characterization of the arc-smoothness of the hyperspace F-2(X) when X
   is 1-dimensional, and another of F-n(X) when X is a locally connected,
   1-dimensional continuum. Further, we give some conditions on a continuum
   X that imply the arcsmoothness of the hyperspace F-n(X) at some
   particular elements. Finally, we characterize the arc-smoothness at
   elements of F-3(X) in the class of hereditarily unicoherent continua and
   of F-2(X) in the class of 1-dimensional continua.},

Abstract = {It is estimated that at least 100 million people worldwide will suffer
   from epilepsy at some point in their lives. This neurological disorder
   induces brain death due to the excessive liberation of glutamate, which
   activates the postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors,
   which in turn cause the reuptake of intracellular
   calcium(excitotoxicity). This excitotoxicity elicits a series of events
   leading to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation and the generation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several studies in experimental models
   and in humans have demonstrated that certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)
   exhibit antioxidant effects by modulating the activity of various
   enzymes associated with this type of stress. Considering the
   above-mentioned data, we aimed to compile evidence elucidating how AEDs
   such as valproic acid (VPA), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and topiramate (TPM)
   modulate oxidative stress.},

Title = {Understanding the formation of ancient intertropical disjunct

Abstract = {Numerous taxa show ancient intertropical disjunct distributions. Many
   can be explained by well-known processes of historical vicariance, such
   as the breakup of Gondwanaland. Others, such as Asian-Neotropical
   divergences are not as well understood. To clarify the phylogenetic
   position and understand biogeographic and temporal origins of the
   geographically disjunct and morphologically unique genera of
   hinged-teeth snakes, Scaphiodontophis (n = 1) and Sibynophis (n = 9;
   Colubridae), we inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny with additional 107
   taxa representing the superfamily Colubroidea using four genes (c-mos,
   cyt-b, ND2, RAG-1; 3085 bp). We used this tree to estimate ancestral
   areas for the group. The results show that Scaphiodontophis is sister to
   Sibynophis, both originated in the late Eocene/Oligocene in Asia and
   likely dispersed through Beringia to the New World, but unlike other
   snake groups left no extant species in temperate North America. Current
   recognition of Scaphiodontophiinae renders Colubrinae paraphyletic, and
   we resurrect the previously named subfamily Sibynophiinae to encompass
   both genera and use the tribes Sibynophiini (Sibynophis) and
   Scaphiodontophiini (Scaphiodontophis) to highlight the geographically
   distinct areas occupied by these taxa. These results suggest that
   intercontinental dispersal with extinction in intermediate areas can
   explain puzzling patterns of ancient intertropical disjunct
   distributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A geometric perspective on singularity resolution previously applied by
   Corichi and Singh to some loop quantum cosmological models is here
   adopted to investigate the interior geometry of a spherically symmetric
   black hole described by an effective Kantowski-Sachs model which
   includes loop quantum corrections. Central to the analysis is the
   expansion rate entering the Raychauduri equation. Such quantity is here
   studied in three cases differing on how the gap area of full loop
   quantum gravity is incorporated. For the (mu) over bar (1), or improved
   quantization, case we find that the Schwarzschild singularity is
   manifestly resolved. A numerical analysis in this case shows there are
   regimes of gravitational repulsion. The other two cases are currently
   under study.},

Title = {Cardiovascular medicine at face value: a qualitative pilot study on
   clinical axiology},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Introduction: Cardiology is characterized by its state-of-the-art
   biomedical technology and the predominance of Evidence-Based Medicine.
   This predominance makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to
   deal with the ethical dilemmas that emerge in this subspecialty. This
   paper is a first endeavor to empirically investigate the axiological
   foundations of the healthcare professionals in a cardiology hospital.
   Our pilot study selected, as the target population, cardiology personnel
   not only because of their difficult ethical deliberations but also
   because of the stringent conditions in which they have to make them.
   Therefore, there is an urgent need to reconsider clinical ethics and
   Value-Based Medicine. This study proposes a qualitative analysis of the
   values and the virtues of healthcare professionals in a cardiology
   hospital in order to establish how the former impact upon the medical
   and ethical decisions made by the latter.
   Results: We point out the need for strengthening the roles of healthcare
   personnel as educators and guidance counselors in order to meet the ends
   of medicine, as well as the need for an ethical discernment that is
   compatible with our results, namely, that the ethical values developed
   by healthcare professionals stem from their life history as well as
   their professional education.
   Conclusion: We establish the kind of actions, communication skills and
   empathy that are required to build a stronger patient-healthcare
   professional relationship, which at the same time improves prognosis,
   treatment efficiency and therapeutic adhesion.},

Title = {Rodent endemism, turnover and biogeographical transitions on elevation
   gradients in the northwestern Argentinian Andes},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {78},
Number = {5},
Pages = {322-331},
Abstract = {The aim of this research is to relate patterns of endemism and turnover
   along a local elevation gradient in northwest Argentina with continental
   biogeographical transitions. Specimen based records constituted the
   principal source of information to infer rodent distribution along the
   elevation gradient. I assessed elevational variation of richness,
   endemism and turnover by means of non-linear regression analysis. Then I
   identified five distributional patterns based on the overlap of species
   geographic range. Their frequency along elevation was used to validate
   biogeographical boundaries inferred by-turnover rates. Eleven species
   out of 37 (30\%) are endemic to the study area. Species richness and
   endemism were hump-shaped. The rate of endemism reached its maximum
   value at the upper limit of the forest (2500 m). By contrast, species
   turnover was U-shaped, with a small peak at 1500 m and a maximum at 3500
   m. The species' geographic range patterns were not randomly distributed
   along elevation but agglomerated at specific elevation. Species turnover
   and chorological analysis suggest two biogeographical boundaries, a
   weaker at 1500 m and a stronger at 3500 m. The 1500 m boundary marks the
   transition from assemblages dominated by Lowland-widespread fauna at
   lower elevation to Montane (Andean eastern slopes) species at middle
   elevation. This boundary is characterized by moderate species turnover
   and high species richness. The strong turnover rate at 3500 and the
   dominance of highland Andean. and Andean-Patagonian species above this
   elevation suggest the occurrence of the transition between the
   Neotropical and Andean regions; which is characterised by an almost
   complete species replacement. (C) 2013 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur

Title = {Influence of Culture Conditions on Laccase Production, Growth, and

   Rainforest (Argentina)},
Journal = {BIORESOURCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Many biotechnological processes pursuing sustainability aim for
   effective, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly alternatives to
   replace conventional practices. Laccase-containing lignocellulolytic
   systems from white rot fungi have been shown to be an efficient
   enzymatic tool for ecofriendly biological treatments. One objective of
   the biotechnological enzymes production process is to find optimum
   growing and secretion conditions for a selected fungus. In this work,
   different fungi isolated from the Misiones rainforest (Coriolus
   versicolor f. antarcticus BAFC-266, Ganoderma applanatum strain F,
   Phlebia brevispora BAFC-633, and Pycnoporus sanguineus BAFC-2126) were
   incubated at different temperatures (25, 29, 33 degrees C) and pH values
   (3.5, 4.5, 5.5) under static conditions for 7, 10, and 14 days to
   evaluate their growing ability and laccase (Lac) production. Results
   revealed specific favorable conditions for growth and protein secretion
   depending on the fungus under consideration, making it necessary to
   adjust these parameters for each particular case. The combined effect of
   these cultivation parameters showed a marked influence on the secreted
   Lac activity by P. brevispora BAFC 633, with the highest activity
   (similar to 240 U/l) at 29 degrees C and pH 4.5 at the 10th day of
   cultivation. The presence of Lac isoenzymes also depended on the pH,
   temperature, and time of cultivation for the different tested fungi.},

   illustrated: Salvia confertispicata belongs to subsection Lophanthoideae
   and shares morphological similarities with Salvia mocinoi; nevertheless,
   the former differs in having compact inflorescences, rhombic ascendant
   bracts with caudate apex and cuneate base, glabrate calyx at anthesis,
   an invaginated corolla tube which is the longest of all the species in
   subsection Lophanthoideae. The new species had only been collected in
   the state of Guerrero, where it is commonly found in oak forests,
   pine-oak forests, pine forests, cloud forests, and tropical deciduous
   forests.},

Abstract = {The advance on the development of new technologies has evolved
   exponentially in recent years. This improvement has a direct impact on
   education where there are now very popular tools for conducting
   electronic academic presentations as ``Power Point{''}, ``Adobe
   Reader{''} (PDF) and ``Prezi{''} because of its compatibility with
   different platforms and its simplicity on interface management.
   Recently arises a new option that combines static text with multimedia
   objects, this could improve learning objects known as now and opens new
   ways for education using ``iBooks Author{''} the first truly intuitive
   and easy tool for publishing eBooks, a strong multimedia component.
   {[}1]
   ``IBooks Author{''} offers a new world of possibilities where auto
   edition is reachable to anyone without (or with very little) prior
   knowledge, eBooks can be published in a visual and simple way.
   Textbooks are just one example, the possibilities go far beyond. The
   Faculty of Computing Mazatlan, in Autonomous University of Sinaloa in
   its implementation of a degree of blended learning mode, uses iBook
   Author to digitalize its classes in an interactive way in which teachers
   can keep their teaching materials on an e-portfolio server which,
   according to Greenberg (2004) {[}2], the e-portfolio is a Network
   Application that provides the author with administrative functions for
   managing and organizing work (files) created with different applications
   and for controlling who can see the work and who can discuss the work
   (access).
   This gives the student the opportunity not only to see the content but
   also to hear the multimedia teaching material, as many times as
   necessary, and strengthen their learning in a much more attractive. All
   this without being in person at the university, only by visiting the
   e-portfolio hosted on some service of ``Cloud Computing{''}.
   In this sense, this paper attempts to measure the level of feasibility
   on the implementation of this new technology and the replacement of any
   other format through an analysis of acceptance with students that
   consult materials developed with ``iBooks Author{''} from Apple, within
   the learning management system used in the Faculty.},

Abstract = {We present a class of thermodynamic systems with constant thermodynamic
   curvature which, within the context of geometric approaches of
   thermodynamics, can be interpreted as constant thermodynamic interaction
   among their components. In particular, for systems constrained by the
   vanishing of the Hessian curvature we write down the systems of partial
   differential equations. In such a case it is possible to find a subset
   of solutions lying on a circumference in an abstract space constructed
   from the first derivatives of the isothermal coordinates. We conjecture
   that solutions on the characteristic circumference are of physical
   relevance, separating them from those of pure mathematical interest. We
   present the case of a one-parameter family of fundamental relations
   that-when lying in the circumference-describe a polytropic fluid.},

   This original approach based on surface topography analysis should be
   easy to implement to any phase change material exhibiting sizeable

Title = {Obtaining of Sol-Gel Ketorolac-Silica Nanoparticles: Characterization
   and Drug Release Kinetics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among most commonly
   prescribed medications worldwide. NSAIDs play an important role due to
   their pronounced analgesic potency, anti-inflammatory effects, and
   lesser side effects compared to opioids. However, adverse effects
   including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects seriously
   complicate their prolonged use. In the present work we prepare
   SiO2-based nanoparticles with ketorolac, for controlled release
   proposes. The nanomaterials were prepared by the sol-gel technology at
   acidic conditions and two different water/alcoxide ratios were used.
   FTIR spectroscopy was performed in order to characterize the solids and
   drug-SiO2 interactions. Thermal analysis and nitrogen adsorption
   isotherms showed thermal stability of the drug and confirmed the
   presence of particles with high surface area. Transmission electron
   micrographies of the samples showed the nanosize particles (20 nm)
   forming aggregates. Drug release profiles were collected by means of
   UV-Vis spectroscopy and kinetic analysis was developed. Release data
   were fitted and 1 : 8 sample showed a sustained release over ten hours;
   90\% of the drug was delivered at the end of the time.},

Title = {Partitioning the variation of woody plant β-diversity in a landscape of
   secondary tropical dry forests across spatial scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Question What is the relative importance of forest successional age,
   environmental heterogeneity, landscape structure and spatial structure
   of sampling sites on beta-diversity of tropical dry forests (TDF)? How
   do the magnitude of beta-diversity and the relative influence of
   factors, processes and mechanisms driving beta-diversity differ at
   different spatial grains? What are the effects of stand age on
   beta-diversity?
   Location Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.
   Methods Floristic composition was obtained from a hierarchical survey
   performed in 276 sites distributed across 23 sampling landscapes (SL)
   (12 sites per SL). Land-cover classes were derived from the
   classification of multi-spectral SPOT 5 satellite imagery. We calculated
   landscape metrics of patch type for each SL, and characterized local
   soil conditions for each sampling site. A principal coordinates of
   neighbour matrices (PCNM) analysis was performed to estimate spatial
   variables, and partial redundancy analysis was used to decompose
   variation into spatial, stand age and landscape structure components.
   Results The magnitude of beta-diversity varied with spatial scale (grain
   size), and was larger at the local than at the landscape grain. The
   magnitude of beta-diversity also decreased slightly but significantly
   with successional age. There were significant differences in species
   composition among vegetation classes. Environmental factors (local soil
   conditions, as well as landscape structure) and spatial structure both
   contributed to woody plant beta-diversity in our TDF landscape, but
   their relative importance was scale-dependent. At the local grain size,
   both the environment (mainly soil conditions) and the spatial structure
   strongly affected beta-diversity, while at the landscape grain,
   environmental factors (variation in soil conditions, as well as
   landscape configuration) played a more prominent role.
   Conclusions The magnitude of beta-diversity decreased with increasing
   spatial grain and successional age, while the relative importance of
   mechanisms influencing beta-diversity was scale-dependent: both niche
   partitioning and dispersal limitation affect beta-diversity at the local
   grain size, while niche partitioning prevails at the landscape grain.},

Abstract = {The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in penile carcinoma
   (PeC) is currently reported and about half of the PeC is associated with
   HPV16 and 18. We used a PCR-based strategy by using HPV general primers
   to analyze 86 penile carcinomas paraffin-embedded tissues. Some clinical
   data, the histological subtype, growth pattern, and differentiation
   degree were also collected. The amplified fragments were then sequenced
   to confirm the HPV type and for HPV16/18 variants. DNA samples were also
   subjected to relative real time PCR for hTERC gene copy number. Some
   clinical data were also collected. Global HPV frequency was 77.9\%.
   Relative contributions was for HPV16 (85\%), 31 (4.4\%), 11 (4.4\%), 58,
   33, 18, and 59 (1.4\% each one). Sequence analysis of HPV16 identified
   European variants and Asian-American (AAb-c) variants in 92\% and in 8\%
   of the samples, respectively. Furthermore hTERC gene amplification was
   observed in only 17\% of the cases. Our results suggest that some
   members of HPV A9 group (represented by HPV16, 58, and 31) are the most
   frequent among PeC patients studied with an important contribution from
   HPV16 European variant. The hTERC gene amplification could be poorly
   related to penile epithelial tissue.},

Abstract = {Particulate matter may promote cardiovascular disease, possibly as a
   consequence of its oxidative potential. Studies using susceptible
   animals indicate that particulate matter aggravates atherosclerosis by
   increasing lipid/macrophage content in plaques. Macrophage lipid uptake
   requires oxidized low-density lipoprotein and scavenger receptors; same
   receptors are involved in particulate matter uptake. We studied in vitro
   particulate matter potential to oxidize low-density lipoproteins and
   subsequent cell uptake through scavenger receptors. Particulate
   matter-induced low-density lipoproteins oxidation was evaluated by the
   thiobarbituric acid assay. Binding/internalization was tested in wild
   type and scavenger receptortransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and
   in RAW264.7 cells using fluorescently labeled low-density lipoproteins.
   Dose-dependent binding/internalization only occurred in scavenger
   receptortransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and RAW264.7 cells.
   Competition binding/internalization using particles showed that
   particulate matter induced decreased binding (50\%) and internalization
   (70\%) of particle-oxidized low-density lipoproteins and native
   low-density lipoproteins. Results indicate that particulate matter was
   capable of oxidizing low-density lipoproteins, favoring macrophage
   internalization, and also altered scavenger and low-density lipoproteins
   receptor function. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J BiochemMol Toxicol

Abstract = {Spatial variation in particulate matterrelated health and toxicological
   outcomes is partly due to its composition. We studied spatial
   variability in particle composition and induced cellular responses in
   Mexico City to complement an ongoing epidemiologic study. We measured
   elements, endotoxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in two
   particle size fractions collected in five sites. We compared the in
   vitro proinflammatory response of J774A.1 and THP-1 cells after exposure
   to particles, measuring subsequent TNFa and IL-6 secretion. Particle
   composition varied by site and size. Particle constituents were
   subjected to principal component analysis, identifying three components:
   C1 (Si, Sr, Mg, Ca, Al, Fe, Mn, endotoxin), C2 (polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons), and C3 (Zn, S, Sb, Ni, Cu, Pb). Induced TNFa levels were
   higher and more heterogeneous than IL-6 levels. Cytokines produced by
   both cell lines only correlated with C1, suggesting that constituents
   associated with soil induced the inflammatory response and explain
   observed spatial differences. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {Unplanned urban development threatens natural ecosystems. Assessing
   ecosystem recovery after anthropogenic disturbances and identifying
   plant species that may facilitate vegetation regeneration are critical
   for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban
   areas. At the periphery of Mexico City, illegal human settlements
   produced different levels of disturbance on natural plant communities
   developed on a lava field near the Ajusco mountain range. We assessed
   natural regeneration of plant communities 20 years after the abandonment
   of the settlements, in sites that received low (manual harvesting of
   non-timber forest products), medium (removal of aboveground vegetation),
   and high (removal of substrate and whole vegetation) disturbance levels.
   We also tested the potential facilitative role played by dominant tree
   and shrub species. Plant diversity and vegetation biomass decreased as
   disturbance level increased. Sites with high disturbance level showed
   poor regeneration and the lowest species similarity compared to the
   least disturbed sites. Six dominant species (i.e., those with the
   highest abundance, frequency, and/or basal area) were common to all
   sites. Among them, three species (the tree Buddleja cordata, and two
   shrubs, Ageratina glabrata and Sedum oxypetalum) were identified as
   potential facilitators of community regeneration, because plant density
   and species richness were significantly higher under their canopies than
   at open sites. We propose that analyzing community structural traits of
   the successional vegetation (such as species diversity and biomass) and
   identifying potential facilitator species are useful steps in assessing
   the recovery ability of plant communities to anthropogenic disturbances,
   and in designing restoration strategies.},

Abstract = {The structure and optical properties of a set of
   R-1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dithiol (R-BINAS) monosubstituted
   A-Au-38(SCH3)(24) clusters are studied by means of time dependent
   density functional theory (TD-DFT). While it was proposed earlier that
   BINAS selectively binds to monomer motifs (SR-Au-SR) covering the Au-23
   core, our calculations suggest a binding mode that bridges two dimer
   (SR-Au-SR-Au-RS) motifs. The more stable isomers show a negligible
   distortion induced by BINAS adsorption on the Au-38(SCH3)(24) cluster
   which is reflected by similar optical and Circular Dichroism (CD)
   spectra to those found for the parent cluster. The results furthermore
   show that BINAS adsorption does not enhance the CD signals of the
   Au-38(SCH3)(24) cluster.},

Pages = {15-71},
Abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of the genera of Listroderini LeConte,
   1876 are analyzed based on 58 morphological characters. The genera are
   grouped in four clades, which are given subtribal status: Macrostyphlina
   new subtribe (Adioristidius, Amathynetoides, Andesianellus,
   Macrostyphlus, Nacodius and Puranius), Palaechthina Brinck, 1948
   (Anorthorhinus, Gunodes, Haversiella, Inaccodes, Listronotus,
   Neopachytychius, Palaechthus, Palaechtodes, Steriphus and Tristanodes),
   Falklandiina new subtribe (Falklandiellus, Falklandiopsis, Falklandius,
   Gromilus, Lanteriella, Liparogetus, Nestrius and Telurus), and
   Listroderina (Acroriellus, Acrorius, Acrostomus, Antarctobius,
   Germainiellus, Hyperoides, Lamiarhinus, Listroderes, Methypora,
   Philippius, Rupanius and Trachodema). The subtribes are characterized
   and keys to identify them and their genera are provided. Listroderini
   have four main biogeographical patterns: Andean (Macrostyphlina),
   Andean-New Zealand (Falklandiina), Andean-Neotropical-Australian
   (Listroderina) and Andean-Neotropical-Australian-New
   Zealand-Nearctic-Tristan da Cunha-Gough islands (Palaechthina).
   Geographical paralogy, particularly evident in the Subantarctic
   subregion of the Andean region, suggests that Listroderini are an
   ancient Gondwanic group, in which several extinction events might have
   obscured relationships among the areas.},

Abstract = {The ``complex thinking{''} is located within the epistemological debate
   that denies the separation between hard and soft sciences, which raises
   the need to articulate knowledge and ethics, which considers
   reductionist thinking,, which proposed a paradigm that can distinguish
   without dismantling to distinguish, identify and associate without
   reducing, as opposed to the principles of rule of disjunction and
   reduction that has prevailed since the seventeenth century, and it calls
   the ``paradigm of simplification{''} which certainly has allowed the
   progress of scientific knowledge held the twentieth century, but through
   the tissue fragments hyper complex realities
   Based on the above, this paper aims to determine how a graduate student
   in economic and administrative sciences at National Autonomous
   University of Mexico (UNAM) perceive that their teachers are including
   their program contents The seven complex lesson: detecting error and
   illusion, the principles of pertinent knowledge, teaching the human
   condition, earth identity, confronting uncertainties, teaching
   understanding of each other, ethics for the humane genre of mankind.
   Also, a validated instrument was designed through a Cronbach's Alpha
   which makes measurement scales are reliable variables taking a simple
   384 students from a population of 1500 enrolled in graduate student
   economic and administrative sciences in UNAM, applied a simple random
   sampling for a finite population at confidence level of 95\% and with
   error probability of .05. Similarly we measured the relationship between
   the seven complex lessons of Edgar Morin and the four pillars of
   education proposed by United Nations Organization for Education Science
   and Culture (UNESCO)},

Abstract = {Thermopreference, tolerance and oxygen consumption rates of early
   juveniles Octopus maya (O. maya; weight range 0.38-0.78 g) were
   determined after acclimating the octopuses to temperatures (18, 22, 26,
   and 30 degrees C) for 20 days. The results indicated a direct
   relationship between preferred temperature (PT) and acclimated
   temperature, the PT was 23.4 degrees C. Critical Thermal Maxima, (CTMax;
   31.8 +/- 1.2, 32.7 +/- 0.9, 34.8 +/- 1.4 and 36.5 +/- 1.0) and Critical
   Thermal Minima, (CTMin; 11.6 +/- 0.2, 12.8 +/- 0.6, 13.7 +/- 1.0, 19.00
   +/- 0.9) increased significantly (P<0.05) with increasing acclimation
   temperatures. The endpoint for CTMax was ink release and for CTMin was
   tentacles curled, respectively. A thermal tolerance polygon over the
   range of 18-30 degrees C resulted in a calculated area of 210.0 degrees
   C-2. The oxygen consumption rate increased significantly alpha=0.05 with
   increasing acclimation temperatures between 18 and 30 degrees C. Maximum
   and minimum temperature quotients (Q(10)) were observed between 26-30
   degrees C and 22-26 degrees C as 3.03 and 1.71, respectively. These
   results suggest that O. maya has an increased capability for adapting to
   moderate temperatures, and suggest increased culture potential in
   subtropical regions southeast of Mexico. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Obtaining an effective execution of a parallel system requires that the
   mapping of the processes (of the parallel software) on the processors
   (of the parallel hardware) is efficiently performed. Hence, this paper
   presents an efficient mapping strategy based on optimizing
   communications between processes as well as load balancing process
   distribution onto an arbitrary processor network. Such a mapping
   strategy is developed as a parallel program, based on the simultaneous
   execution of local, independent processes. This fact contrasts with many
   other approaches for solving the mapping problem, like simulated
   annealing, heuristic search, and others, which require a centralized
   control for the mapping. In this paper, it is shown that the present
   mapping strategy is efficient enough when applied to two different
   mapping problems. Based upon an experimental setup, it is possible to
   review this mapping strategy following the related impact.},

   the Campeche Bank, Yucatan Peninsula, we have recorded 51 species
   belonging to the clades Cephalaspidea, Aplysiomorpha, Sacoglossa,
   Eutenidiacea, and Cladobranchia. Of these, 30 species had not been
   previously reported for the Campeche Bank and 20 out of those are new
   records for the Atlantic coast of Mexico. The nudibranch Tambja cf

Abstract = {The main causes of school learning problems are intellectual factors,
   mental disorders, language, cognitive disorders, emotional problems,
   behavioral problems, physical defects, visual or hearing impairments and
   chronic illnesses. Bakwin H. (1974).
   This research will take place around the condition of dyslexia which
   according to Rose J. (2009) is a learning difficulty that primarily
   affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and
   spelling. Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in
   phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed.
   The Dyslexia is a learning disability that has been well documented and
   have encountered problems that arise from this disease including hearing
   problems, motor, attention deficit among other students suffering from
   an early age and affects the performance in the classroom in a high
   percentage, more specifically in this research we focus on the type of
   condition that affects reading ability declining and encouraging student
   learning. This condition currently known as ``Reading Disorder{''} and
   different types have been identified as the Gnosic-praxis, Dysgraphia,
   Aphasia, Auditory processing disorder.
   This has begun to attract the interest of specialists in the field of
   education since there is much research done on the problem of dyslexia
   but very little that focuses on the development of learning objects that
   operate online and are specialized for students suffering from any type
   of dyslexia.
   Doing a research for the design and development of objects that will
   help this condition together with all its variants is extensive to cover
   so in the present research we focus the most common type, which
   according to statistics from the Mexican Social Security Institute
   (IMSS) is the Reading delay, Gnosicpraxis by developing several object
   types, some examples are: detection of the disease, improvement in
   reading, visual support, etc.. These running through an online platform
   accessible from any point of access from any device.},

Abstract = {Selective antibacterial peptides containing less than 30 amino acid
   residues, cationic, with amphipathic properties, have been the subject
   of several studies due to their active participation and beneficial
   effects in strengthening the immune system of all living organisms. This
   manuscript reports the results of a comparison between the group of
   selective antibacterial peptides and another group called ``cell
   penetrating peptides{''}. An important number of the selective
   antibacterial peptides are cell penetrating peptides, suggesting that
   their toxicity is related to their uptake mechanism. The verification of
   this observation also includes the adaptation of a method previously
   published, called Polarity index, which reproduces and confirms the
   action of this new set of peptides. The efficiency of this method was
   verified based on four different databases, yielding a high score. The
   verification was based exclusively on the peptides already reported in
   the databases which have been experimentally verified.},

Title = {Detection of Severe Respiratory Disease Epidemic Outbreaks by
   CUSUM-Based Overcrowd-Severe-Respiratory-Disease-Index Model},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {A severe respiratory disease epidemic outbreak correlates with a high
   demand of specific supplies and specialized personnel to hold it back in
   a wide region or set of regions; these supplies would be beds, storage
   areas, hemodynamic monitors, and mechanical ventilators, as well as
   physicians, respiratory technicians, and specialized nurses. We describe
   an online cumulative sum based model named
   Overcrowd-Severe-Respiratory-Disease-Index based on the Modified
   Overcrowd Index that simultaneously monitors and informs the demand of
   those supplies and personnel in a healthcare network generating early
   warnings of severe respiratory disease epidemic outbreaks through the
   interpretation of such variables. A post hoc historical archive is
   generated, helping physicians in charge to improve the transit and
   future allocation of supplies in the entire hospital network during the
   outbreak. The model was thoroughly verified in a virtual scenario,
   generating multiple epidemic outbreaks in a 6-year span for a
   13-hospital network. When it was superimposed over the H1N1 influenza
   outbreak census (2008-2010) taken by the National Institute of Medical
   Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubiran in Mexico City, it showed that
   it is an effective algorithm to notify early warnings of severe
   respiratory disease epidemic outbreaks with a minimal rate of false
   alerts.},

Title = {Geographic variation and the evolution of song in Mesoamerican
   rufous-naped wrens Campylorhynchus rufinucha},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Speciation may be influenced by geographic variation in animal signals,
   particularly when those signals are important in reproductive decisions.
   Here, we describe patterns of geographic variation in the song of
   rufous-naped wrens Campylorhynchus rufinucha. This species complex is a
   morphologically variable taxon confined to tropical dry forest areas
   from Mexico to northwestern Costa Rica. Morphological and genetic
   analyses suggest that there are at least three partially isolated groups
   within the complex, including a secondary-contact zone in coastal
   western Chiapas between the subspecies C. r. humilus and C. r.
   nigricaudatus. Based on recordings throughout their geographic range, we
   investigate the effects of historical isolation on song structure and
   analyze whether genetic differences or climatic conditions explain
   observed patterns of variation. Our findings, based on a
   culturally-transmitted and sexually-selected trait, support the
   hypothesis that three evolutionary units exist within this taxon. Our
   results suggest that song differences between genetic groups were
   influenced by historical isolation. We report a strong relationship
   between vocal dissimilarity and genetic distance, suggesting that
   differences in vocal characteristics are probably affected by the same
   factors that drive genetic divergence. We argue that the evolution of
   song in this taxon is influenced by vicariant events, followed by
   accumulation of changes in song structure due to several possible
   factors: cultural drift in song structure; genetic drift in features
   related to song production; or natural selection acting on features that
   influence songs, such as body and beak size.},

Title = {Identifying biases at different spatial and temporal scales of
   diversification: a case study in the Neotropical parrotlet genus Forpus},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {The temporal origins of the extraordinary biodiversity of the
   Neotropical region are highly debated. Recent empirical work has found
   support for alternative models on the tempo of speciation in Neotropical
   species further fuelling the debate. However, relationships within many
   Neotropical lineages are poorly understood, and it is unclear how this
   uncertainty impacts inferences on the evolution of taxa in the region.
   We examined the robustness of diversification patterns in the avian
   genus Forpus by testing whether the use of different units of
   biodiversity (i.e. biological species and statistically inferred
   species) impacted diversification rates and inferences regarding
   important biogeographic breaks in the genus. We found that the best-fit
   model of diversification for the biological species data set was a
   declining rate of diversification; whereas a model of constant
   diversification was the best-fit model for statistically inferred
   species or subspecies. Moreover, the relative importance of different
   landscape features in delimiting genetic structure across the landscape
   varied across data sets with differing units of biodiversity. Patterns
   based on divergence times among biological species indicated old
   speciation events across major geographic and river barriers. In
   contrast, data sets more inclusive of the diversity in Forpus illustrate
   the role of both old divergence across major landscape features and more
   recent divergences that are possibly attributed to Pleistocene climatic
   changes. Overall, these results indicate that conflicting models on the
   temporal origins of Neotropical birds may be attributable to sampling
   biases.},

Title = {Periodic Distribution of a Putative Nucleosome Positioning Motif in
   Human, Nonhuman Primates, and Archaea: Mutual Information Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {Recently, Trifonov's group proposed a 10-mer DNA motif YYYYYRRRRR as a
   solution of the long-standing problem of sequence-based nucleosome
   positioning. To test whether this generic decamer represents a
   biological meaningful signal, we compare the distribution of this motif
   in primates and Archaea, which are known to contain nucleosomes, and in
   Eubacteria, which do not possess nucleosomes. The distribution of the
   motif is analyzed by the mutual information function (MIF) with a
   shifted version of itself (MIF profile). We found common features in the
   patterns of this generic decamer on MIF profiles among primate species,
   and interestingly we found conspicuous but dissimilar MIF profiles for
   each Archaea tested. The overall MIF profiles for each chromosome in
   each primate species also follow a similar pattern. Trifonov's generic
   decamer may be a highly conserved motif for the nucleosome positioning,
   but we argue that this is not the only motif. The distribution of this
   generic decamer exhibits previously unidentified periodicities, which
   are associated to highly repetitive sequences in the genome. Alu
   repetitive elements contribute to the most fundamental structure of
   nucleosome positioning in higher Eukaryotes. In some regions of primate
   chromosomes, the distribution of the decamer shows symmetrical patterns
   including inverted repeats.},

Journal = {ARBOR-CIENCIA PENSAMIENTO Y CULTURA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {189},
Number = {763},
Abstract = {This article uses a review of a number of tree diagrams to highlight how
   the fact that Darwin was to choose the metaphor of a tree to describe
   evolutionary relationships between organisms should come as no great
   surprise, as the tree already occupied an important position in European
   iconography. In the review of some of the uses of a ``tree{''} to
   represent different types of relationships in the pre-Darwinian age, we
   want to illustrate two basic issues. One particularly important issue is
   that Darwin had the insight of including various symbols and metaphors
   that were already being used to represent different aspects of the
   living world in his own theory of evolution, particularly the general
   metaphor of branching and rebranching. The other is that when Darwin
   published On the Origin of Species in 1859, people were already familiar
   with the idea of a tree to represent genealogy. This may have been an
   important factor in people's familiarity with evolutionary diagrams and
   also in strongly associating them with religious metaphors.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Microscopic studies in heavy nuclei are very scarce due to large valence
   spaces involved. This computational problem can be avoided by means of
   the use of symmetry-based models. Ground-state, gamma and beta bands,
   and their B(E2) transition strengths in Dy160-168 isotopes, are studied
   in the framework of the pseudo-SU(3) model which includes the preserving
   symmetry Q . Q term and the symmetry-breaking Nilsson and pairing terms,
   systematically parametrized. Additionally, three rotor-like terms are
   considered, whose free parameters, fixed for all members of the chain,
   are used to fine tune the moment of inertia of rotational bands and the
   band head of gamma and beta bands. The model succesfully describes in a
   systematic way rotational features in these nuclei and allows to
   extrapolate toward the midshell nucleus Dy-170. The results presented
   show that it is possible to study a full chain of isotopes or isotones
   in the region with the present model.},

Abstract = {We report the results of in vitro anti-lipase and antioxidant assays
   using crude ethanolic extracts from 30 plants grown in Oaxaca, Mexico.
   Anti-lipase tests were performed by using porcine pancreatic lipase
   (PPL) {[}EC 3.1.1.3] from Affymetrix/USB. The extracts of Solanum
   erianthum, Salvia microphylla, Brungmansia suaveolens and Cuphea
   aequipetala showed up to 60\% PPL inhibition. The effect of these
   extracts on the kinetic parameters of PPL (K-m=0.36 mM, and V-max=0.085
   mM mm (-1)) revealed that the alcoholic preparations of S. erianthum and
   C. aequipetala engendered a non-competitive inhibition (V-max=0.055 mM
   mm (-1); V-max=0.053 mM min (-1)), whereas those of S. microphylla and
   B. suaveolens produced a mixed inhibition (K-m=0.567 mM, V-max=0.051 mM
   mm (-1); K-m=0.643 mM, V-max=0.042 mM mm (-1)). In addition to these
   findings, seven extracts from different plants were able to inhibit PPL
   in the range of 30-50\%. Antioxidant tests against 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl
   hydrazyl (DPPH) confirmed that Arctostaphylos pungens, Gnaphalium
   roseum, Crotalaria pumila, Cuphea aequipetala, Rhus chondroloma, and
   Satureja laevigata possess relevant antioxidant activity (IC50=50-80 mu
   g mL(-1)). The general composition of the most effective ethanolic
   extracts was obtained in order to confirm their known chemistry reported
   by previous works. Comprehensive chemical analysis of the ethanolic
   extracts and their poisoning effects suggests that S. micro phyla, C.
   aequipetala and A. pungens could be considered as the best sources with
   both desired properties.},

Abstract = {The Cactaceae are prominent members of national and international
   endangered species lists. This is true for even those that have not been
   studied in any significant detail, and given the need to assess these
   species there is still a general lack of information. Demographic
   studies in the Cactaceae have highlighted several threats some of which
   are clearly human induced (disturbance), and others that have a
   biological component (e.g. low survival rates of seedlings). We modelled
   the population dynamics of Astrophytum ornatum (the southernmost
   representative of Astrophytum) in one population in central Mexico,
   during a three year period. We constructed two size classified
   transition matrices and determined the growth rate (lambda), as well as
   the stochastic log growth rate. We simulated changes in the matrix
   elements that correspond to the seed bank and the seed-seedling
   transition as these were the most important bottlenecks to population
   growth. In both years, the growth rate indicates a declining population,
   which will face serious problems in the next 2 to 3 decades. The
   simulations show that the seed bank is not as important as the
   seed-seedling transition. Any program that aims to restore A. ornatum
   populations needs to enhance seedling establishment. (c) 2012 Elsevier

   genera are Phlegmariurus and Selaginella. The individual tracks and the
   generalized track indicate that this zone is part of the Neotropical
   biotic component, which ends at the central hills of Argentina. The
   generalized track borders the South American Transition Zone that
   represents a successful barrier for lycophytes and also separates the
   Andean and Neotropical regions. Furthermore, the region of the Parque
   Nacional Calilegua is closely related to the Parana subregion,
   overcoming the arid barrier represented by the Chacoan subregion, a

Abstract = {Langmuir (L) and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of fullerene
   C-60-oligo-para-phenylenevinylene (OPV) derivative with six C12H25
   aliphatic chainswere characterized. For the Langmuir films, isotherms of
   surface pressure versus molecular area, compression/expansion cycles
   (hysteresis curves) and Brewster angle microscopic images were obtained.
   We performed molecular mechanics and density functional theory
   calculations to determine the molecular and electronic structure of our
   compound at a water-air interface. We found agreement between
   experimental and theoretical values for the molecular surface area. LB
   films of up to ten layers were obtained on glass substrates, and were
   characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. We observed that the
   absorbance at a wavelength of 326 nm grows almost linearly as a function
   of the number of layers. Films on glass-indium tin oxide were
   characterized by atomic force microscopy. We also observed a uniform
   deposition over the whole area of the scanned substrate. We demonstrated
   that the fullerene C-60-OPV derivative is able to form both L and LB
   films preventing fullerene aggregation with its aliphatic chains. We
   suggest that, due to its electron-acceptor properties, the C-60-OPV
   derivative could be used for organic-photovoltaic and organic-electronic
   applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {USE OF LENGTH-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS FOR GROWTH ESTIMATION OF THE CALIFORNIA

Abstract = {Indirect methods such as length frequency analysis have not been
   recommended for growth estimation in octopus (length is not a good
   measure of size for soft-bodied organisms; size is not a good indicator
   of age because of the high interindividual variability in growth rates
   and an asymptotic growth is often assumed). However, these methods are
   still applied in various places where octopus fisheries exist because
   they are low cost and easy to apply in most fisheries where there are no
   financial resources or scientific capacity to use direct methods. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate whether length frequency
   analysis is an appropriate method for determining the growth pattern of
   Octopus bimaculatus from the Gulf of California. We tested the widely
   used methods ELEFAN I and NSLCA, and a modal progression analysis with a
   multimodel approach. The results showed that the growth pattern of O.
   bimaculatus was reasonably described using these analyses. First, the
   suitability of using mantle length as a measure of size was confirmed
   through a significant length weight relationship. A length age key was
   also generated in terms of probability to take into account the
   variability in growth rates, and with the multimodel approach it was not
   necessary to assume asymptotic growth. Population size structure is the
   most readily obtained and probably the most commonly used or only
   available information in a large number of fisheries. Therefore, the
   usefulness of length frequency analyses should not be underestimated
   when direct methods are available.},

   through 83 localities; this was rated by means of a conglomerate
   analysis using the similarity indexes this was put together using the
   UPGMA method; dendrograms were also made. The bioclimatic profile of
   each group was obtained using BIOCLIM, the variable average was used to
   generate a matrix which was rated like the previous one. Based on the
   order analysis the importance of bioclimatic variables was evaluated
   through its main component. The floristical similar groups match
   Mexico's floristic provinces and bioclimatic profiles which back up such
   groupings. Based on their bioclimatic features the MCF are rated on
   three groups of localities. It has been noticed that the closer
   localities are geographically they exhibit greater floristic
   similarities. Based on the research of the MCF relationships among
   floristic provinces we reach stronger hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services science has developed at a fast rate in Latin
   America, a region characterized by a high biological and cultural
   diversity, strong emphasis in foreign investment, and high socioeconomic
   inequities. Here we conducted the following analyses at the regional and
   national scales: (1) how and when did the study of ecosystem services
   arise in each country?, (2) what is our present understanding of
   ecosystem service supply, delivery to societies, and social and economic
   values?, (3) what is the state of the art in integrating tradeoffs among
   services and in using interdisciplinary perspectives?, and (4) how has
   ecosystem service research been connected to policy design or management
   for sustainability? A large literature review ( > 1000 references)
   showed that in Latin America ES supply and links to policy have been the
   most frequently assessed. Overall, emphasis has been placed on a few
   services, namely carbon and water. Payments for ecosystem services have
   received considerable attention in the region, though with strong
   differences across nations and with important limitations in their
   application. The future of the ecosystem service paradigm in Latin
   America will largely depend on its capacity to demonstrate effectiveness
   in meeting both conservation and development goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Pages = {8515-8526},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nowadays, Network Control Systems represent a common solution when
   solving connectivity issues for distributed control systems. However,
   this approach tends to increase the time complexity in terms of time
   delays, and thus, making necessary the study of the behavior of such
   time delays and the differential equations which model such a behavior.
   Time delays need to be known a priori, but from a dynamic, real-time
   behavior. To do so, this paper presents the use of a dynamic, priority
   exchange scheduling. The objective is to show how to tackle multiple
   time delays, as well as faults that are bounded, and the dynamic
   response from real-time scheduling approximation. The novelty of this
   approach is to use both, the appearance of faults and time delays, as
   perturbations considering nonlinear behavior through a fuzzy TKS
   approach, in a codesign strategy. The related control law is designed
   considering fuzzy logic for nonlinear time delays coupling and inherent
   local fault appearance.},

Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {367-380},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study the development of the male and female flowers of Begonia
   gracilis is described, using conventional histological and microscopic
   techniques. The aims were to clarify whether just one whorl is initiated
   on the meristem or if the flower begins as bisexual and later abortion
   occurs on androecium or gynoecium. The results show that the
   unisexuality is established in the floral meristem, because any floral
   morph develops atrophied organs. The female flowers develop a style that
   is trifurcate on the tip, forming three dry, bifid, papillate, and
   helically twisted stigmas. The ovule is crassinucellate, bitegmic and
   anatropous. The micropyle is amphistome. The male flowers develop free
   stamens and the gynoecium reminiscences are absent. The microspores
   tetrads are tetrahedric and isobilateral. The pollen grain is bicellular
   and tricolporate, with striate and verrugate-striate exine near to the
   apertures. Based on results we conclude that unisexuality in B. gracilis
   is established since the floral meristem, likely by mutations in
   homeotic genes that regulate the development of sexual whorls.},

Abstract = {Sulforaphane (SF) is an isothiocyanate present in Brassicaceae,
   vegetables that induce the detoxification of electrophiles and reactive
   oxygen species. SF has been correlated with chemoprevention mechanisms
   against degenerative diseases. We tested if the SF had an effect against
   methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), urethane (URE), 4-NQO and H2O2. SF (>95\%
   purity, 0.14, 0.28, 0.56 mm) was diluted in a DMSO/Tw80/EtOH mixture
   (DTE) corresponding to 25, 50, 100\% of lyophilized broccoli. The SF
   treatment (0.14 mM) was positive for small spots in the ST cross and
   negative in the HB cross. In the HB cross, SF (0.28 mM) was genotoxic.
   In the ST cross, the SF treatments showed a tendency to reduce the
   genotoxic damage caused by MMS, which could be explained by the radical
   scavenging action of the DTE mixture. In the ST cross, the frequency of
   small spots in the SF 0.14 mM/URE treatment was similar to that of
   Water/URE, which can be explained by a DTE and SF scavenger action. In
   both crosses, the results for the direct oxidants, 4-NQO and H2O2, were
   different and must be related to differential modulation of CYPs
   expression and the SF and DTE scavenger properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The floc system has been successfully applied for shrimp grow-out, but
   little is known about floc contribution on reproductive performance. In
   a 30-day trial, spawning performance of broodstock was evaluated in floc
   and earthen ponds. Floc spawners achieved better results (P < 0.05)
   compared with pond spawners in terms of number of spawns per ablated
   female (2.9 vs. 1.3), spawns per spawning female (3.6 vs. 2.4) and
   number of consecutive maturation (average of 3.6 times compared with 2.5
   times in ponds females). Latency period was lower for floc spawners (7.4
   days) than pond spawners (10.7 days) (P < 0.05). The percentage of
   females that spawned at least once were higher in floc (77.1\%) when
   compared with pond spawners (53.8\%) (P < 0.05). Number of eggs per
   spawn per g of spawner's body weight and female mortality presented no
   significant differences between treatments (P > 0.05). Biochemical
   analysis as a nutritional status indicator showed no difference between
   treatments in hepatopancreas (P > 0.05), with the exception of lowest
   values of acylglycerides and acylglycerides/total soluble protein ratio
   in floc females ovary (P < 0.05). Results evidenced better overall
   spawning performance for L. stylirostris broodstock produced under floc
   condition than in earthen ponds.},

Abstract = {Life cycles of living organisms are composed of distinct sub-cycles that
   represent alternative life-history paths with differential impact on
   fitness. We identified three reproductive life-history paths (referred
   here as loops) in the life cycle of one population of the viviparous
   lizard Sceloporus grammicus. We evaluated the relative importance of
   each one of these reproductive paths for the population fitness of these
   lizards during a 5-year period. The first path corresponded to early
   reproduction and included survival to maturity and early fecundity. The
   second path was late reproduction loop and included survival to larger
   adult sizes with the corresponding fecundity rate. The third was
   composed of those individuals skipping the small adult stage within a
   single year, reaching larger sizes early in life with their
   corresponding larger litters (fast growth loop). To examine the
   potential effects of environmental factors on the relative contribution
   of these alternative life-history paths to fitness, we estimated
   stage-specific survival and growth as functions of annual temperature
   and rainfall. Using these estimates of vital rates we constructed annual
   population projection matrices. Then, using demographic elasticities and
   loop analysis, we calculated the relative contribution of each of the
   three reproductive paths to the population growth rates. Our results
   showed that the early reproduction loop is the path with the greatest
   relative contribution to the population growth rate in most years.
   However, increases in environmental temperature resulted in higher
   population growth rates and in greater contribution of the fast growth
   path to the overall fitness of these lizards.},

Abstract = {Slope orientation modifies field microclimatic conditions. Despite this
   well-known pattern, there is few empirical evidence of its influence on
   plant populations, and even lesser for cactus populations. Our goals
   were to determine the effect of N and S slope orientation on some
   population attributes (total stem area, density and size structure) and
   ecomorphology (number branch and orientation) of Neobuxbaumia tetetzo
   (Cactaceae) taller than 1.5 m in Valle de Zapotitlan, Puebla. In
   southerly slope, N. tetetzo showed higher density and a higher tendency
   of branches to northeast orientation than N. tetetzo in northerly slope.
   In the northern slope cacti had a higher number of branches than in the
   southern one. We conclude that slope orientation showed a remarkable
   effect on density, size structure, and ecomorphology of N. tetetzo;
   nevertheless, it is needed to obtain microclimatic records at the study
   site to clarify our understanding about slope orientation effect on N.

   fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disease of unknown etiology
   and uncertain pathogenic mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that the
   pathogenesis of the disease may involve the abnormal expression of
   certain developmental pathways. Here we evaluated the expression of
   Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Patched-1, Smoothened, and transcription factors
   glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI)1 and GLI2 by RT-PCR, as well as
   their localization in IPF and normal lungs by immunohistochemistry. The
   effects of SHH on fibroblast proliferation, migration, collagen and
   fibronectin production, and apoptosis were analyzed by WST-1, Boyden
   chamber chemotaxis, RT-PCR, Sircol, and annexin V-propidium iodide
   binding assays, respectively. Our results showed that all the main
   components of the Sonic signaling pathway were overexpressed in IPF
   lungs. With the exception of Smoothened, they were also upregulated in
   IPF fibroblasts. SHH and GLI2 localized to epithelial cells, whereas
   Patched-1, Smoothened, and GLI1 were observed mainly in fibroblasts and
   inflammatory cells. No staining was detected in normal lungs.
   Recombinant SHH increased fibroblast proliferation (P < 0.05), collagen
   synthesis, (2.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.0 mu g of collagen/ml; P < 0.05),
   fibronectin expression (2-3-fold over control), and migration (190.3 +/-
   12.4\% over control, P < 0.05). No effect was observed on alpha-smooth
   muscle actin expression. SHH protected lung fibroblasts from
   TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma/Fas-induced apoptosis (14.5 +/- 3.2\% vs. 37.3 +/-
   7.2\%, P < 0.0001). This protection was accompanied by modifications in
   several apoptosis-related proteins, including increased expression of
   X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. These findings indicate that the SHH
   pathway is activated in IPF lungs and that SHH may contribute to IPF
   pathogenesis by increasing the proliferation, migration, extracellular
   matrix production, and survival of fibroblasts.},

Abstract = {This study reports growth parameters and mortality for Sphoeroides
   testudineus from La Carbonera, a karstic tropical coastal lagoon on the
   northwestern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. A total of 461
   specimens were collected between April 2009 and March 2010. We obtained
   the length-weight relationship and the growth parameters of von
   Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) by length frequency analysis.
   Additionally, mortality was estimated and analyzed. Exponent b indicated
   an isometric growth pattern. The growth parameters of VBGM were:
   L-infinity=29.50 cm, k=0.77 year(1) and t(0)=- 0.168 years. The
   instantaneous natural mortality was 1.53 year(1).},

Abstract = {The abundance and the proportion of gonadal stages of the chaetognath
   Sagitta euneritica in the lagoon complex Bahia Magdalena (CLBM), Baja
   California Sur, Mexico, was determined. The sampling was made during
   March, June, July, August, September, and November 1982. Sagitta
   euneritica was the species numerically dominant and most widely
   distributed species, with 81\% of the total abundance of the
   chaetognaths, and was found mainly in the juvenile stages 0 (34\%), I
   and II (21\% and 40\%). The stages III and IV were found in low
   percentages, implying that mature organisms are likely found in the
   immediate coastal zone. The size-structure analysis showed small
   organisms from June to August, increasing in September and November;
   consequently that the CLBM can be the area acting as a breeding area for
   this species. The analysis of variance between the percentages of the
   stages by area and by month showed that in March the organisms of stage
   I were significantly different (p = 0.05). Individuals of S. euneritica
   were found in a wide temperature range from 15.5 to 29.5 degrees C. The
   maximum number of chaetognaths in the Magdalena Bay area was related to
   the cold water temperature and the maximum in the area of Almejas Bay
   was associated with a gradual increase of the water temperature in
   summer-autumn. The distribution of S. euneritica in the CLBM tends to be
   heterogeneous, also with a high size-structure of organisms
   predominantly immature, as a survival strategy of the species.},

Abstract = {Histology of reproductive cycle of tropical gar Atractosteus tropicus
   females (Lepisosteiformes: Lepisosteidae) in Tabasco, Mexico. In
   Southeast Mexico, A. tropicus is a species with great ecological,
   economic, cultural and aquaculture value, however wild populations have
   diminished due to diverse anthropological causes. The objective of this
   study was to characterize the reproductive cycle of A. tropicus, with a
   description of complete gonad structure and the changes in germinal and
   somatic elements during oogenesis, for better management and use of this
   species. Six sexually mature females (N=72) were captured monthly with
   drag nets during one year cycle (October 2003-October 2004) in wild
   populations of Pomposu lagoon, municipality of Jalpa de Mendez, Tabasco,
   Mexico. Females were sacrificed by decapitation and the ovaries were
   processed by standard histological methods; the diameter of 10-20
   oocytes taken at random was determined in different stages of
   development. Gonadosmatic index (GSI), gonadal volume (gV) and follicule
   diameter (ID) were determined monthly. Among results we could determine
   eight oogenesis developmental stages: I: chromatin nucleolus stage, II:
   early perinucleolus stage, III: mid perinucleolus stage, IV: advanced
   perinucleolus stage, V: early vitellogenesis stage, VI: mid
   vitellogenesis stage, VII) advanced vitellogenesis stage and VIII: final
   maturation stage. The reproductive cycle could be divided in four
   phases: I: proliferative phase, II: initial maturation phase, III: late
   maturation phase, IV: regressing phase. Analysis of the data obtained
   from the IGS, gV and ID values, oogenesis stages and reproductive
   phases, indicate that in December previtellogenesis phase restarts, from
   March through July yolk deposition (vitellogenesis) occurs, and from
   August to November the maximum reproductive activity takes place.
   Contrasting this pattern with local environmental factors such as
   temperature and precipitation, we suggested that these may serve as an
   environmental activator in the development of oogenesis and spawning of
   this species. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (4): 1857-1871. Epub 2012 December 01.},

Abstract = {Environmental metal pollution is one of the major problems faced by
   humankind. This type of pollution affects aquatic systems (estuaries,
   coastal lagoons, etc.), which are very dynamic systems, therefore making
   the study of the effects on the organisms that inhabit them an essential
   issue. In this study, the capacity of metal regulation by decapod
   crustacean Penaeus vannamei juveniles was determined. The effects of
   zinc, lead, and cadmium were tested individually and as a metal mixture
   exposure to determine possible synergism. The results showed that
   juvenile shrimps were capable of regulating zinc and lead, whereas
   cadmium was accumulated without any excretion, at least within the
   concentrations studied. It was also proved that under the estuarine
   conditions tested here, P. vannamei juveniles showed capacity to act as
   a bioindicator for cadmium.},

Abstract = {The recently discovered Upper Cretaceous locality El Gorrion (SI48, San
   Luis Potosi, central Mexico) yielded three specimens of chaetetids. All
   specimens can be attributed to the genus Blastochaetetes Dietrich due to
   the discontinuities in the calicle walls. In addition, one of them could
   be classified as Blastochaetetes flabellum (Michelin) based on its
   distinctive internal dimensions. The remaining two specimens were
   assigned to an undetermined species taxon in open nomenclature, namely
   Blastochaetetes sp. indet. 1.
   Three growth forms were identified for the chaetetids of El Gorrion.
   Blastochaetetes flabellum has a laminar growth form, which may be an
   adaptation to survive high-energy conditions, depending on whether the
   chaetetid was fixed to its substrate or not. The two remaining specimens
   show either a smooth, non-enveloping or a ragged, high-domical
   morphotypes, which respond to different environmental conditions.
   The material is strongly silicified and therefore poorly preserved The
   specimens lack spicules, so it is not possible to place them into any of
   the known sponge groups. Nevertheless, these fossils, as chaetetids, are
   clearly sponges.
   This finding is of great importance since such organisms have been
   neither reported for the Mesozoic in Mexico, nor for the Cretaceous in
   North America. Furthermore, it constitutes the second report of
   chaetetids for the Mesozoic of both North and Latin America.},

   functional theory, we investigated some properties of the intermetallic
   compounds R2Ni2In (R La, Ce, Pr, Nd). We studied the hydrogen atom
   occupancy in the La2Ni2In intermetallic and we found that the available
   interstitial sites for hydrogen occupation can be clearly differentiated
   by the hydrogen site energy. Hydrogen atoms are stabilized by the Ni-H
   bonding interaction. This result indicates that the formation of a solid
   solution and eventually a hydride phase follow an enthalpic controlled
   order. With this information, we have investigated the formation of
   hydride phases in La2Ni2In. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {The adsorption and nucleation of gold clusters Au-n (n = 1-5) on
   montmorillonite (MMT) is studied using the density functional theory.
   All the calculations were performed using the full-potential linearized
   augmented-plane-wave method as implemented in the WIEN2k code. We
   constructed a MMT supercell of formula Si16Al6Mg2O40(OH) 8 containing
   four unit cells and the first moments of the nucleation process were
   studied by adding the gold atoms one by one on the MMT. The results show
   that the interaction energies between the gold clusters and the MMT are
   negative indicating that the Au-n-MMT complexes are stable. In the
   Au-n-MMT systems (n = 3-5), two gold atoms maintain the coordination
   with basal oxygens and the Au-O distance was about 2.0-2.3 angstrom. The
   Au-Au average distance is 2.6 angstrom in the supported gold clusters.
   The formation of the second layer of gold atoms occurs upon the arrival
   of the third gold atom. We are reporting that the transition of 2D -> 3D
   gold cluster structures is located from Au-3 to Au-4 on MMT. The total
   density of states of clusters Au, Au-2, Au-3, Au-4, and Au-5 on MMT
   allows us to affirm that (i) gold atoms are the main contributors to the
   states closest to the Fermi level and (ii) in Au-4-MMT and Au-5-MMT
   systems, the main contributors to the states closest to the Fermi level
   are the most external gold atoms, and therefore these atoms are probably
   the most susceptible to interact with adsorbates and the most active
   sites. Odd-even oscillations in the values of the energy gap and
   interaction energy were found: the odd-numbered supported clusters, Au-3
   and Au-5, have larger energy gaps and more negative interaction
   energies. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the electronic structure of LaNiIn intermetallic
   compound and the derived LaNiInH4/3 hydride. All-electron electronic
   structure computations in the solid state as well as in molecular
   fragments were carried out. We found evidence of HH attractive
   interactions indicating that the violation of Westlake criteria, which
   establish a minimal HH distance in intermetallic compounds can be
   interpreted in a different manner. We computed the energy bands and the
   total and partial density of states using ab initio full potential-all

Title = {Criteria for the determination of time dependent scalings in the Fock
   quantization of scalar fields with a time dependent mass in ultrastatic
   spacetimes},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {86},
Number = {10},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {We consider the quantization of scalar fields in spacetimes such that,
   by means of a suitable scaling of the field by a time dependent
   function, the field equation can be regarded as that of a field with a
   time dependent mass propagating in an auxiliary ultrastatic static
   background. For Klein-Gordon fields, it is well known that there exist
   an infinite number of nonequivalent Fock representations of the
   canonical commutation relations and, therefore, of inequivalent quantum
   theories. A context in which this kind of ambiguities arises and
   prevents the derivation of robust results is, e.g., in the quantum
   analysis of cosmological perturbations. In these situations, typically,
   a suitable scaling of the field by a time dependent function leads to a
   description in an auxiliary static background, though the
   nonstationarity still shows up in a time dependent mass. For such a
   field description, and assuming the compactness of the spatial sections,
   we recently proved in three or less spatial dimensions that the criteria
   of a natural implementation of the spatial symmetries and of a unitary
   time evolution are able to select a unique class of unitarily equivalent
   vacua, and hence of Fock representations. In this work, we succeed to
   extend our uniqueness result to the consideration of all possible field
   descriptions that can be reached by a time dependent canonical
   transformation which, in particular, involves a scaling of the field by
   a function of time. These kinds of canonical transformations modify the
   dynamics of the system and introduce a further ambiguity in its quantum
   description, exceeding the choice of a Fock representation. Remarkably,
   for any compact spatial manifold in less than four dimensions, we show
   that our criteria eliminate any possible nontrivial scaling of the field
   other than that leading to the description in an auxiliary static
   background. Besides, we show that either no time dependent redefinition
   of the field momentum is allowed or, if this may happen-something which
   is typically the case only for one-dimensional spatial manifolds-the
   redefinition does not introduce any Fock representation that cannot be
   obtained by a unitary transformation.},

Abstract = {This paper concerns about energy-efficient broadcasts in mobile ad hoc
   networks, yet in a model where each station moves on the plane with
   uniform rectilinear motion. Such restriction is imposed to discern which
   issues arise from the introduction of movement in the wireless ad hoc
   networks.
   Given a transmission range assignment for a set of n stations S, we
   provide an polynomial O(n (2))-time algorithm to decide whether a
   broadcast operation from a source station could be performed or not.
   Additionally, we study the problem of computing a transmission range
   assignment for S that minimizes the energy required in a broadcast
   operation. An O(n (3)log n)-time algorithm for this problem is
   presented, under the assumption that all stations have equally sized
   transmission ranges. However, we prove that the general version of such
   problem is NP-hard and not approximable within a (1-o(1))ln n factor
   (unless NPaS,DTIME(n (O(log log n)))). We then propose a polynomial time
   approximation algorithm for a restricted version of that problem.},

Abstract = {Triuris brevistylis Donn. Sm. (Triuridaceae: Pandanales), a
   mycoheterotrophic monocotyledon with populations in Mexico and
   Guatemala, is closely related to Lacandonia schismatica E. Martinez et
   C. H. Ramos, a triurid species displaying a peculiar ``inside-out{''}
   arrangement in its reproductive axes. Triuris brevistylis is a
   polygamodioecious species in which four types of bisexual ramets-genets
   coexist besides regular (i.e., unisexual) male and female flowers. Here,
   we characterize the embryology of three of the following different types
   of reproductive axes in T. brevistylis: male and female flowers and a
   bisexual floral type in which stamens develop at the base of the
   receptacle of an otherwise female-looking flower. Through this
   embryological characterization, we have detected that cleistogamy, a
   mechanism previously considered exclusive to L. schismatica, occurs in
   the bisexual flowers. Besides serving as characters for the systematics
   of Triuridaceae and Pandanales, our data establish that morphogenetic
   and reproductive patterns in T. brevistylis are more complex than in L.
   schismatica. Therefore, we claim that our results contribute to a
   refined assessment of the controversy regarding morphological
   interpretation of reproductive axes in triurids.},

Title = {Uniqueness of the Fock quantization of scalar fields in spatially flat
   cosmological spacetimes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We study the Fock quantization of scalar fields in (generically) time
   dependent scenarios, focusing on the case in which the field propagation
   occurs in either a background or effective spacetime with spatial
   sections of flat compact topology. The discussion finds important
   applications in cosmology, like e.g. in the description of test
   Klein-Gordon fields and scalar perturbations in
   Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime in the observationally favored flat
   case. Two types of ambiguities in the quantization are analyzed. First,
   the infinite ambiguity existing in the choice of a Fock representation
   for the canonical commutation relations, understandable as the freedom
   in the choice of inequivalent vacua for a given field. Besides, in
   cosmological situations, it is customary to scale the fields by time
   dependent functions, which absorb part of the evolution arising from the
   spacetime, which is treated classically. This leads to an additional
   ambiguity, this time in the choice of a canonical pair of field
   variables. We show that both types of ambiguities are removed by the
   requirements of (a) invariance of the vacuum under the symmetries of the
   three-torus, and (b) unitary implementation of the dynamics in the
   quantum theory. In this way, one arrives at a unique class of unitarily
   equivalent Fock quantizations for the system. This result provides
   considerable robustness to the quantum predictions and renders
   meaningful the confrontation with observation.},

Abstract = {We describe seasonal variations of the histology of the seminiferous
   tubules and efferent ducts of the tropical, viviparous skink, Mabuya
   brachypoda, throughout the year. The specimens were collected monthly,
   in Nacajuca, Tabasco state, Mexico. The results revealed strong annual
   variations in testicular volume, stages of the germ cells, and diameter
   and height of the epithelia of seminiferous tubules and efferent ducts.
   Recrudescence was detected from November to December, when initial
   mitotic activity of spermatogonia in the seminiferous tubules were
   observed, coinciding with the decrease of temperature, photoperiod and
   rainy season. From January to February, early spermatogenesis continued
   and early primary and secondary spermatocytes were developing within the
   seminiferous epithelium. From March through April, numerous spermatids
   in metamorphosis were observed. Spermiogenesis was completed from May
   through July, which coincided with an increase in temperature,
   photoperiod, and rainfall. Regression occurred from August through
   September when testicular volume and spermatogenic activity decreased.
   During this time, the seminiferous epithelium decreased in thickness,
   and germ cell recruitment ceased, only Sertoli cells and spermatogonia
   were present in the epithelium. Throughout testicular regression
   spermatocytes and spermatids disappeared and the presence of cellular
   debris, and scattered spermatozoa were observed in the lumen. The
   regressed testes presented the total suspension of spermatogenesis.
   During October, the seminiferous tubules contained only spermatogonia
   and Sertoli cells, and the size of the lumen was reduced, giving the
   appearance that it was occluded. In concert with testis development, the
   efferent ducts were packed with spermatozoa from May through August. The
   epididymis was devoid of spermatozoa by September. M. brachypoda
   exhibited a prenuptial pattern, in which spermatogenesis preceded the
   mating season. The seasonal cycle variations of spermatogenesis in M.
   brachypoda are the result of a single extended spermiation event, which
   is characteristic of reptilian species. J. Morphol. 273:1199-1213, 2012.

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Cover crop species represent an affordable and effective weed control
   method in agroecosystems; nonetheless, the effect of its use on
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been scantily studied. The goal
   of this study was to determine root colonization levels and AMF species
   richness in the rhizosphere of maize plants and weed species growing
   under different cover crop and weed control regimes in a long-term
   experiment. The treatment levels used were (1) cover of Mucuna
   deeringian (Muc), (2) ``mulch{''} of Leucaena leucocephala (Leu), (3)
   ``mulch{''} of Lysiloma latisiliquum (Lys), (4) herbicide (Her), (5)
   manual weeding (CD), (6) no weeding (SD), and (7) no maize and no
   weeding (B). A total of 18 species of AMF belonging to eight genera
   (Acaulospora, Ambispora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus,
   Rhizophagus, Sclerocystis, and Scutellospora) were identified from trap
   cultures. Muc and Lys treatments had a positive impact on AMF species
   richness (11 and seven species, respectively), while Leu and B
   treatments on the other hand gave the lowest richness values (six
   species each). AMF colonization levels in roots of maize and weeds
   differed significantly between treatment levels. Overall, the use of
   cover crop species had a positive impact on AMF species richness as well
   as on the percentage of root colonized by AMF. These findings have
   important implications for the management of traditional agroecosystems
   and show that the use of cover crop species for weed control can result
   in a more diverse AMF community which should potentially increase crop
   production in the long run.},

Abstract = {Rationale Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease
   characterized by epithelial phenotypic changes and fibroblast
   activation. Based on the temporal heterogeneity of IPF, we hypothesized
   that hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells regulate the fibrotic
   response. Objectives: To identify novel mediators of fibrosis comparing
   the transcriptional signature of hyperplastic epithelial cells and
   conserved epithelial cells in the same lung.
   Methods: Laser capture microscope and microarrays analysis were used to
   identify differentially expressed genes in IPF lungs. Bleomycin-induced
   lung fibrosis was evaluated in Mmp19-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice.
   The role of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-19 was additionally studied
   by transfecting the human MMP19 in alveolar epithelial cells.
   Measurements and Main Results: Laser capture microscope followed by
   microarray analysis revealed a novel mediator, MMP-19, in hyperplastic
   epithelial cells adjacent to fibrotic regions. Mmp19(-/-) mice showed a
   significantly increased lung fibrotic response to bleomycin compared
   with WT mice. A549 epithelial cells transfected with human MMP19
   stimulated wound healing and cell migration, whereas silencing MMP19 had
   the opposite effect. Gene expression microarray of transfected A549
   cells showed that PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) was one
   of the highly induced genes. PTGS2 was overexpressed in IPF lungs and
   colocalized with MMP-19 in hyperplastic epithelial cells. In WT mice,
   PTGS2 was significantly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage and lung
   tissues after bleomycin-induced fibrosis, but not in Mmp19(-/-) mice.
   Inhibition of Mmp-19 by siRNA resulted in inhibition of Ptgs2 at mRNA
   and protein levels.
   Conclusions: Up-regulation of MMP19 induced by lung injury may play a
   protective role in the development of fibrosis through the induction of
   PTGS2.},

Abstract = {The spectrum and eigenstates of any field quadrature operator restricted
   to a finite number N of photons are studied, in terms of the Hermite
   polynomials. By (naturally) defining approximate eigenstates, which
   represent highly localized wavefunctions with up to N photons, one can
   arrive at an appropriate notion of limit for the spectrum of the
   quadrature as N goes to infinity, in the sense that the limit coincides
   with the spectrum of the infinite-dimensional quadrature operator. In
   particular, this notion allows the spectra of truncated phase operators
   to tend to the complete unit circle, as one would expect. A regular
   structure for the zeros of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel is also shown.},

Title = {Biophysics of Active Vesicle Transport, an Intermediate Step That
   Couples Excitation and Exocytosis of Serotonin in the Neuronal Soma},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Transmitter exocytosis from the neuronal soma is evoked by brief trains
   of high frequency electrical activity and continues for several minutes.
   Here we studied how active vesicle transport towards the plasma membrane
   contributes to this slow phenomenon in serotonergic leech Retzius
   neurons, by combining electron microscopy, the kinetics of exocytosis
   obtained from FM1-43 dye fluorescence as vesicles fuse with the plasma
   membrane, and a diffusion equation incorporating the forces of local
   confinement and molecular motors. Electron micrographs of neurons at
   rest or after stimulation with 1 Hz trains showed cytoplasmic clusters
   of dense core vesicles at 1.5+/-0.2 and 3.7+/-0.3 mu m distances from
   the plasma membrane, to which they were bound through microtubule
   bundles. By contrast, after 20 Hz stimulation vesicle clusters were
   apposed to the plasma membrane, suggesting that transport was induced by
   electrical stimulation. Consistently, 20 Hz stimulation of cultured
   neurons induced spotted FM1-43 fluorescence increases with one or two
   slow sigmoidal kinetics, suggesting exocytosis from an equal number of
   vesicle clusters. These fluorescence increases were prevented by
   colchicine, which suggested microtubule-dependent vesicle transport.
   Model fitting to the fluorescence kinetics predicted that 52-951
   vesicles/cluster were transported along 0.60-6.18 mu m distances at
   average 11-95 nms(-1) velocities. The ATP cost per vesicle fused
   (0.4-72.0), calculated from the ratio of the Delta G(process)/Delta
   G(ATP), depended on the ratio of the traveling velocity and the number
   of vesicles in the cluster. Interestingly, the distance-dependence of
   the ATP cost per vesicle was bistable, with low energy values at 1.4 and
   3.3 mu m, similar to the average resting distances of the vesicle
   clusters, and a high energy barrier at 1.6-2.0 mu m. Our study confirms
   that active vesicle transport is an intermediate step for somatic
   serotonin exocytosis by Retzius neurons and provides a quantitative
   method for analyzing similar phenomena in other cell types.},

Title = {Genuine and Spurious Phase Synchronization Strengths during
   Consciousness and General Anesthesia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Spectral content in a physiological dataset of finite size has the
   potential to produce spurious measures of coherence. This is especially
   true for electroencephalography (EEG) during general anesthesia because
   of the significant alteration of the power spectrum. In this study we
   quantitatively evaluated the genuine and spurious phase synchronization
   strength (PSS) of EEG during consciousness, general anesthesia, and
   recovery. A computational approach based on the randomized data method
   was used for evaluating genuine and spurious PSS. The validity of the
   method was tested with a simulated dataset. We applied this method to
   the EEG of normal subjects undergoing general anesthesia and
   investigated the finite size effects of EEG references, data length and
   spectral content on phase synchronization. The most influential factor
   for genuine PSS was the type of EEG reference; the most influential
   factor for spurious PSS was the spectral content. Genuine and spurious
   PSS showed characteristic temporal patterns for each frequency band
   across consciousness and anesthesia. Simultaneous measurement of both
   genuine and spurious PSS during general anesthesia is necessary in order
   to avoid incorrect interpretations regarding states of consciousness.},

Abstract = {Forty one geological features were coded as cladistic binary characters
   and analyzed using a parsimony algorithm in order to infer the
   historical relationships among 24 Caribbean tectonostratigraphic
   terranes. The cladistic analysis produced two equally parsimonious
   geological area cladograms. The strict consensus cladogram depicts the
   group of allochthonous tectonostratigraphic terranes as a monophyletic
   group reflecting historical relationships that agree roughly with a
   Pacific origin of the Caribbean plate. We conclude that the cladistic
   method represents a promising analytical tool to be used in historical
   geology as well as a common language useful to compare geological and
   biogeographical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Given a vector field X in a Riemannian manifold, a hypersurface is said
   to have a canonical principal direction relative to X if the projection
   of X onto the tangent space of the hypersurface gives a principal
   direction. We give different ways for building these hypersurfaces, as
   well as a number of useful characterizations. In particular, we relate
   them with transnormal functions and eikonal equations. With the further
   condition of having constant mean curvature (CMC) we obtain a
   characterization of the canonical principal direction surfaces in
   Euclidean space as Delaunay surfaces. We also prove that CMC constant
   angle hypersurfaces in a product R x N are either totally geodesic or
   cylinders. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {713-723},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Motivated by a problem faced by road construction companies, we develop
   a new model to obtain an optimal transportation schedule of mobile
   machines which have to travel to execute tasks. In this problem, each
   task is characterized by the location where it is to be executed, a
   work-content in terms of machine-time units, and one or more time
   intervals within which it can be performed. The machines can be
   transported from one location to another at any time, thus the problem
   has an indefinite number of variables. However, this indefinite number
   of variables can be reduced to a definite one because, as we prove, the
   problem has an optimal solution in which the arrivals of machines occur
   only at certain time instants. The objective is to minimize the total
   transportation cost such that all the tasks are executed within their
   time intervals. The constraints ensuring that the tasks are processed
   within their prescribed time intervals are nonlinear; nevertheless, due
   to the sets of the possible arrival times of the machines forming
   bounded convex polyhedra, our problem can be transformed into a mixed
   integer linear program by the same device used in the decomposition
   principle of Dantzig-Wolfe.},

Abstract = {We present a model equation describing the behavior of a density
   oscillator and a set of experiments to test the model. The system
   consists of a cup containing salty water with an orifice in its base,
   partially submerged in an outer vessel filled with fresh water. Such a
   setup produces an oscillatory flow of water through the orifice. The
   density oscillator is an oscillatory system that shares common features
   with more complex systems with a stable limit cycle. Although a Rayleigh
   equation has been used as a model equation for these systems, we propose
   a different approach based on the integration of the hydrodynamic
   equations on a streamline. The model reproduces the experimental
   oscillation and predicts the period as a function of the physical
   parameters. Phase resetting curves observed in experiments under
   external biphasic excitation can be reproduced by the model.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive information on species distribution and species
   composition patterns of plant communities is required for effective
   conservation and management of biodiversity. Remote sensing offers an
   inexpensive means of attaining complete spatial coverage for large
   areas, at regular time intervals, and can therefore be extremely useful
   for estimating both species richness and spatial variation of species
   composition (alpha- and beta-diversity). An essential step to map such
   attributes is to identify and understand their main drivers. We used
   remotely sensed data as a surrogate of plant productivity and habitat
   structure variables for explaining alpha- and beta-diversity, and
   evaluated the relative roles of productivity-habitat structure and
   spatial variables in explaining observed patterns of alpha- and
   beta-diversity by using a Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrices
   analysis. We also examined the relationship between remotely sensed and
   field data, in order to map alpha- and beta-diversity at the
   landscape-level in the Yucatan Peninsula, using a regression kriging
   procedure. These two procedures integrate the relationship of species
   richness and spatial species turnover both with remotely sensed data and
   spatial structure. The empirical models so obtained can be used to
   predict species richness and variation in species composition, and they
   can be regarded as valuable tools not only for identifying areas with
   high local species richness (alpha-diversity), but also areas with high
   species turnover (beta-diversity). Ultimately, information obtained in
   this way can help maximize the number of species preserved in a
   landscape. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},

Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {In this work we present a theoretical study of structural stability of
   CrVO4-type orthophosphates InPO4 and TiPO4 at ambient and high
   pressures. Total energy calculations and lattice dynamics were used to
   obtain structural and vibrational properties of these compounds. Also,
   we have studied at ambient pressure the orthophosphates TlPO4 and VPO4
   in order to compare their structural and vibrational properties with
   InPO4 and TiPO4. Here we analyze the variation of the Raman and IR
   frequencies as functions of the reduced mass. Using the phonon
   dispersion relations we have calculated the Gibbs free energy and
   evaluated the phase transitions at 300 K, at which most experimental
   measurements are performed. By taking into consideration the Bastide's
   diagram and previous theoretical and experimental studies in APO(4)
   compounds, we have considered 12 candidate structures for the
   high-pressure regime. We found the following sequence for
   pressure-driven structural transition: CrVO4 type -> zircon -> scheelite
   -> wolframite, for InPO4 and TiPO4. The equations of state, phonon
   frequencies, and their behavior with pressure of the most stable
   polymorphs are also reported. We also included the phonon spectrum and
   the projected phonon density of states of each phase for both compounds.
   Finally, calculation of the evolution of magnetic moment is reported for
   TiPO4.},

Abstract = {A recent re-examination of BCS theory leads one to devise a generalized
   BEC formalism (GBEC), that is, essentially a boson-fermion (BF) model
   containing three new ingredients: (i) Cooper pairs (CPs), in contrast to
   BCS pairs, as real bosons; (ii) BF vertex interactions (analogous to
   electron-phonon vertices); and (iii) two-hole CPs (2hCPs) accounted for
   along with two-electron CPs (2eCPs). In addition to the usual normal
   phase at high-enough temperatures T, three condensed phases emerge at
   lower temperatures with substantially higher Tcs than BCS theory. These
   are: two pure BEC phases of 2eCPs and of 2hCPs as well as a mixed phase
   with both kinds of CPs. BCS theory is precisely recovered with a mixed
   phase of equal numbers of both kinds of CPs. In contrast to the
   well-known BCS exponential rise from zero of Tc as function of
   carrier-number density the GBEC scheme exhibits the linear rise as
   function of doping as eminently observed in high-Tc underdoped
   superconductors such as YBCO. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Pressure effects on the electronic and optical properties of

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {86},

Abstract = {The electronic band-structure and band-gap dependence on the d character
   of A(2+) cation in AWO(4) wolframite-type oxides is investigated for
   different compounds (A = Mg, Zn, Cd, and Mn) by means of
   optical-absorption spectroscopy and first-principles density-functional
   calculations. High pressure is used to tune their properties up to 10
   GPa by changing the bonding distances establishing electronic to
   structural correlations. The effect of unfilled d levels is found to
   produce changes in the nature of the band gap as well as its pressure
   dependence without structural changes. Thus, whereas Mg, Zn, and Cd,
   with empty or filled d electron shells, give rise to direct and wide
   band gaps, Mn, with a half-filled d shell, is found to have an indirect
   band gap that is more than 1.6 eV smaller than for the other
   wolframites. In addition, the band gaps of MgWO4, ZnWO4, and CdWO4
   blue-shift linearly with pressure, with a pressure coefficient of
   approximately 13 eV/GPa. However, the band gap of multiferroic MnWO4
   red-shifts at -22 meV/GPa. Finally, in MnWO4, absorption bands are
   observed at lower energy than the band gap and followed with pressure
   based on the Tanabe-Sugano diagram. This study allows us to estimate the
   crystal-field variation with pressure for the MnO6 complexes and how it
   affects their band-gap closure.},

Title = {Relationship between growth of the preovulatory follicle and its

   CIDR-treated Bos indicus cows: An observational study},

Abstract = {Estrus synchronization induces cows to gather in sexually active groups
   (SAGs) composed of females displaying mounting activity. Although this
   technique promotes the enhancement of sexual behavior, there are cows in
   estrus (CE) that delay estrus expression and also cows not displaying
   estrus (CNDE) even in the presence of a preovulatory follicle (PF). To
   elucidate the physiological mechanisms of the delay in the onset of
   estrus or absence of estrus behavior, an observational study was
   undertaken in 17 Bos indicus cows treated with exogenous progesterone
   (CIDR) to synchronize estrus and to monitor follicular growth and its
   steroidogenic activity. After SAGs formation, cows were ovariectomized
   at 24, 48, and 72 h post-CIDR. Among ovariectomized groups there were
   only 9 CE which: 1) showed differences in the onset of estrus; 2)
   displayed distinctive follicular growth patterns; and 3) at 72 h
   produced the highest intrafollicular estradiol concentration, and showed
   a linear trend to increase expression of P450scc and P450arom.
   Comparison of CE vs. CNDE showed that: 1) both groups had progesterone
   levels indicative of cyclic activity, and a PF which grew at a similar
   rate and size; 2) CE showed a stronger association between time and
   growth; and 3) CE produced more intrafollicular estradiol and
   progesterone, together with the expression of higher levels of P450arom.
   Results suggest that pending on the pattern of growth of the PF and its
   steroidogenic potential to produce estradiol, the onset and expression
   of estrus behavior may be delayed probably until the establishment of
   the appropriate conditions to ensure ovulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The conductivity sigma of vanadium dioxide (VO2) drops at a
   metal-insulator transition by four orders of magnitude due to the
   structural change between tetragonal and monoclinic crystals. In order
   to elucidate this conductivity drop, we introduce the semiclassical
   equation of motion to describe the dynamics of the conduction electron
   (wave packet), where the existence of a k-vector k is prerequisite for
   the conduction. We showed that the periodicity using the non-orthogonal
   bases does not legitimize the electron dynamics in solids. The theory
   suggests that the decrease in the dimensionality of the k-vectors due to
   the structural change is the cause of the conductivity drop. (C) 2012

Title = {Origin of species diversity in the catfish genus Hypostomus

   description of a new species},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Abstract = {Within the Loricariidae, the genus Hypostomus is one of the most
   diversified freshwater catfish groups. Using new sequence data from the
   mitochondrial Control Region (D-loop) we examined the phylogeny of this
   genus. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that, in the Parana river
   basin, species diversity in the genus Hypostomus has been shaped by two
   processes: 1) by inter-basin diversification, generating groups of
   species that inhabit different basins, as a result of dispersal events;
   and 2) via intra-basin speciation as a result of basin fragmentation due
   to past marine transgressions, which produced groups of species within a
   basin. Using the D-loop as a molecular clock, each event of
   diversification was dated and linked with documented hydrological events
   or sea level changes. We also assessed the possible dispersal routes
   between the Parana and Uruguay rivers, in addition to the obvious
   dispersal route via the Rio de la Plata estuary. Finally, we describe a
   new species of Hypostomus inhabiting Middle Parana river, Hypostomus
   arecuta n. sp. This species can be separated from all other Hypostomus
   by having light roundish dots on a darker background and by number of
   premaxillary/dentary teeth.},

Abstract = {Egg retention (ER) and intrauterine embryonic development (IED) have
   been considered intermediate steps in the evolution from oviparity to
   viviparity. Sceloporus aeneus is an oviparous lizard that is closely
   related to the viviparous species (Sceloporus bicanthalis). The present
   study addresses the following 2 questions: 1) Are intermediate stages of
   egg retention (ER and IED) present in populations of Sceloporus aeneus?
   and 2) Are ER and/or IED explained by elevation, precipitation or
   phylogenetic effects? Results indicate that in S. aeneus, ER differs
   among populations. ER was negatively related to altitude and pluvial
   precipitation, whereas average environmental temperature had no effect
   on ER or IER. In contrast to previous observations of oviparous species
   related to viviparous species, populations of S. aeneus with advanced
   IED are associated with environmental factors such as low elevation and
   aridity instead of high elevation and cold climate, whereas the
   comparative analysis shows that there are no significative evolutionary
   changes throughout the phylogeny, which means that the altitude has no
   effect on the transition to the evolution of viviparity in S. aeneus-S
   bicanthalis.},

Abstract = {We analyzed variation in body growth of a new lizard species of the
   genus Xenosaurus Peters that is endemic to the Biosphere Reserve, Sierra
   Gorda - Queretaro, Mexico. We calculated body growth rates and analyzed
   them by means of the Von Bertalanffy, logistic-by-length, and
   logistic-by-weight growth models. We used the logistic-by-length model
   to describe the growth pattern of these lizards because this model
   provided the best fit to the observed body growth rates. No significant
   differences were found between males and females in the characteristic
   growth parameter or in the projected asymptotic size. Therefore, a
   single growth curve was constructed for both sexes. Males reach maturity
   at 24 months, whereas females at 37 months. Size-independent growth
   rates were not statistically different among years (2001, 2002 and 2003)
   or between season (wet and dry season). Our results suggest that
   variation in body growth of this species is not caused exclusively by
   environmental variation, but rather by a complex combination of
   environmental and genetic factors.},

Abstract = {We describe conditions under which higher-dimensional billiard models in
   bounded, convex regions are fully chaotic, generalizing the Bunimovich
   stadium to dimensions above two. An example is a three-dimensional
   stadium bounded by a cylinder and several planes; the combination of
   these elements may give rise to defocusing, allowing large chaotic
   regions in phase space. By studying families of marginally-stable
   periodic orbits that populate the residual part of phase space, we
   identify conditions under which a nonlinear instability mechanism arises
   in their vicinity. For particular geometries, this mechanism rather
   induces stable nonlinear oscillations, including in the form of
   whispering-gallery modes.},

Abstract = {The problem of a cylinder of mass m and radius r, with its centre of
   mass out of the cylinder's axis, rolling on an inclined plane that makes
   an angle a with respect to the horizontal, is analysed. The equation of
   motion is partially solved to obtain the site where the cylinder loses
   contact with the inclined plane ( jumps). Several simplifications are
   made: the analysed system consists of an homogeneous disc with a
   one-dimensional straight line mass parallel to the disc axis at a
   distance y < r of the centre of the cylinder. To compare our results
   with experimental data, we use a styrofoam cylinder to which a long
   brass rod is embedded parallel to the disc axis at a distance y < r from
   it, so the centre of mass lies at a distance d from the centre of the
   cylinder. Then the disc rolls without slipping on a long wooden ramp
   inclined at 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees with respect to the
   horizontal. To determine the jumping site, the movements are recorded
   with a high-speed video camera (Casio EX ZR100) at 240 and 480 frames
   per second. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical
   predictions.},

Abstract = {For a metric continuum X, let F-n(X) be the hyperspace of nonempty
   subsets of X with at most n points. Given a map f:X -> X we consider the
   induced map f(n):F-n(X) -> F-n(X) given by f(n)(A) = f(A) (the image of
   A under f). Given a dynamic property P, we study the implication: if A
   is an element of F-n(X) has property P in the system (F-n(X),f(n)), then
   each element of A has property P in the system (X,f), and we also study
   the converse implication. We consider properties as periodicity,
   recurrence, regular recurrence, etc. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {ZnO thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on silicon (100)
   wafers were irradiated by 8 MeV Si ions and thermal annealed in order to
   study optical properties. The presence of defects inside thin films as
   well as their implications was discussed by Photoluminescence and
   Spectroscopic Ellipsometry. Photoluminescence confirmed presence of
   energy states in forbidden band-gap associates with ultraviolet emission
   and Zn-t, O-t, and O-Zn defects according to the treatment received.
   Spectroscopic Ellipsometry using the Tauc-Lorentz model plus a Lorentz
   oscillator was found to be the best model to describe the properties of
   irradiated samples that did not receive a second thermal annealing
   treatment. Through this model, it was possible to obtain optical
   band-gap in the range of 3.1-3.3 eV and excellent approximation of
   position in energy of the oscillator. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   sequences},
Journal = {CIENCIAS MARINAS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {563-575},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The phylogenic relationships among the Octopus species have not been
   fully established. We compared sequences for three mitochondrial genes
   (16S ribosomal RNA, cytochrome oxydase I, and cytochrome oxydase Ill)
   from Octopus maya, an endemic taxon of the Yucatan Peninsula, with
   homologous sequences from other taxa within the Octopus genus, with the
   aim of elucidating the phylogenetic relationships of this species.
   Maximum likelihood trees grouped O. maya with octopuses that inhabit the
   East Pacific. Considering that the distribution of O. maya is limited to
   the Yucatan peninsula in the West Atlantic and that the sequences
   analyzed show equal evolutionary rates across taxa, we propose that the
   divergence of O. maya possibly started during the formation of the
   Panama Isthmus, when the Pacific and Atlantic basins were split. The
   genetic distances that O. maya sequences show within the trees obtained
   are in the range of congeneric distances of other taxa in this genus so
   that these sequences are characters that support the inclusion of O.
   maya within the genus Octopus.},

Abstract = {The jaguaroundi is one of the least studied felids on the American
   continent, despite its wide neotropical distribution. Genetic studies
   concerning the species are also inexistent. For the state of Michoacan,
   it has always been assumed as present, since the distribution maps for
   the species in Mexico include the state, but only one record existed
   from 1970. Combining survey methods (camera traps, skulls and tissue
   found in the field, and transects) and molecular genotyping, we obtained
   photographic, biological and genetic evidence that confirms the actual
   presence of the jaguaroundi (Puma yagouaroundi) in 3 regions of
   Michoacan, Mexico. Eleven records were obtained from 7 localities that
   present tropical forests. Seven photographic records revealed that the
   species main activity period is during the afternoon, that both pelage
   phases occur in the state with a greater proportion in the clear pelage
   phase, and that breeding activity occurs in the state. Based on the
   distance and independence among Arteaga and Lazar Cardenas records, we
   hypothesize a continuous distribution of a population along the Sierra
   Madre del Sur and Pacific coast of Michoacan. We are unaware if a
   continuous distribution occurs as well along the Balsas basin. 1 089 and
   1 096 pb cytochrome b gene sequences were obtained and constitute the
   longest sequences reported for the species in Mexico and to the north of
   the continent. The sequences also revealed the presence of 2 distinct
   haplotypes. The presence of species in 3 regions and the presence of 2
   haplotypes allow us to hipothezise that in Michoacan the species may
   possess important genetic diversity, although a greater sample size is
   required for confirmation. The sequences obtained will allow the
   comparison with individuals from other regions of the country in order
   to increase the knowledge on the species genetic variability, and will
   provide support for the identification of populations of conservation
   interest.},

Abstract = {Biological monitoring is a powerful tool for understanding ecological
   patterns and processes, implementing sound management practices, and
   determining wildlife conservation strategies. In Mexico, regional
   long-term bird monitoring has been undertaken only over the last decade.
   Two comprehensive programs have incorporated bird monitoring as the main
   tool for assessing the impact of human productive activities on birds
   and habitats at local and regional levels: the Integrated Ecosystem
   Management (IEM) and the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Mexico (CBMM).
   These programs are implemented in supremely important biodiverse regions
   in the southern and southeastern states of Mexico. Bird monitoring
   activities are based on the recruitment and participation of local
   people linked to sustainable productive projects promoted by the CBMM or
   IEM. Through a series of training workshops delivered by specialists,
   local monitors receive equipment and coordinate to become part of a
   large monitoring network that facilitates regional covertures. This data
   currently being obtained by local people will enable the mid- and
   long-term assessment of the impacts of sustainable human productive
   activities on birds and biodiversity. Community-based bird monitoring
   programs are a promising opportunity for enhancing scientific knowledge,
   improving sustainable practices, and supporting wildlife conservation in
   areas of high biodiversity.},

Abstract = {A non-equilibrium thermodynamics model able to analyze the combined
   effect of diffusion and adsorption in porous materials is proposed. The
   model considers the coupled dynamics of the diffusive phase, described
   by a diffusion type equation, and the adsorbed phase governed by a
   generalized Langmuir equation. It is shown that the combination of
   diffusion and adsorption can be treated as diffusion in an effective
   medium, with an effective diffusion coefficient depending on the
   characteristics of the adsorption kinetics. The interplay between these
   effects leads to the appearance of different regimes in which the
   effective diffusion coefficient exhibits peculiar behaviors such as a
   decrease due to the presence of the adsorption process and a
   non-monotonous behavior resulting from particle interactions. We outline
   applications of the model developed to diffusion in porous materials
   such as zeolites and bentonites, and to engineered highly porous
   materials.},

Abstract = {The Chiricahua Leopard Frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis) occurs in parts
   of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. In the United
   States, it is listed as a federally threatened species. Although
   extensive research has been conducted on populations in the United
   States, the status of most Mexican populations is unknown. We used
   mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to identify a population of L.
   chiricahuensis from the Mexican state of Durango. To better characterize
   this poorly known population, we examined morphological variation in 30
   individuals that included adult males, adult females, and subadult
   females. Multivariate analyses of 21 size-adjusted body measurements
   revealed putative shifts in body dimensions associated with gender and
   ontogeny. Additionally, we observed notable amounts of color pattern
   variation in female specimens. Our field observations from 2008 suggest
   that this population is large and thriving. In light of this, a more
   comprehensive examination may yield valuable conservation insights and
   have implications for the management of declining L. chiricahuensis
   populations in the United States.},

Abstract = {The present study compares 13 physiological and immunological variables
   between a group of healthy Pan ulirus argus lobsters and a group of
   lobsters naturally infected with Panulirus argus Virus 1 (PaV1). Viral
   infection was determined through histopathology and PCR. Ten of the 13
   variables differed significantly between the 2 groups. Using these
   variables, a principal component analysis yielded 2 separate clusters:
   one corresponding to the healthy group and the other corresponding to
   the infected group. In particular, infected lobsters exhibited
   significantly lower levels of osmotic pressure, total hemocyte counts,
   plasmatic proteins, and total phenoloxidase (PO) activity in plasma, as
   well as significantly higher levels of cholesterol and acylglycerides.
   These features are consistent with metabolic wasting, hyperlipidemia,
   and presumed immune suppression. Infection with PaV1 appears to increase
   the susceptibility of lobsters to some other opportunistic pathogens, as
   61.1\% of infected lobsters presented infestations of ciliate epibionts
   (Epystilis and Zoothamniun) in the gill chamber compared with 11.5\%
   lobsters in the healthy group. Infected lobsters also showed
   significantly higher levels of total PO activity in degranulated
   hemocytes and trypsin inhibitor activity, potentially indicating
   activation of immune response by the PO system during the systemic
   infection with PaV1.},

Abstract = {Given a Tychonoff space X, let rho(X) be the set of remote points of X.
   We view rho(X) as a topological space. In this paper we assume that X is
   metrizable and ask for conditions on Y so that rho(X) is homeomorphic to
   rho(Y). This question has been studied before by R.G. Woods and C.
   Gates. We give some results of the following type: if X has topological
   property P and rho(X) is homeomorphic to rho(Y), then Y also has P. We
   also characterize the remote points of the rationals and irrationals up
   to some restrictions. Further, we show that rho(X) and rho(Y) have open
   dense homeomorphic subspaces if X and Y are both nowhere locally
   compact, completely metrizable and share the same cellular type, a
   cardinal invariant we define. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   2012; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00332.2011.-Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
   (IPF) is a devastating lung disease of unknown etiology. A conspicuous
   feature is the formation and persistence of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic
   foci throughout the lung parenchyma. Mechanisms remain unknown, but data
   indicate that fibroblasts acquire an antiapoptotic phenotype. We
   hypothesized that transcriptional silencing of proapoptotic genes may be
   implicated, and accordingly we evaluated the epigenetic regulation of
   p14(ARF). The expression of p14(ARF) was analyzed by RT-PCR in IPF (n =
   8) and normal derived fibroblasts (n = 4) before and after treatment
   with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and trichostatin A (TSA). p14(ARF)
   gene promoter methylation was determined by methylation-specific PCR
   (MS-PCR) and by DNA digestion with endonuclease McrBc, which cleaves
   50\% of methylated CpG. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin-V and nuclear
   staining. p14(ARF) expression was significantly decreased in four of the
   eight IPF fibroblasts lines, which was restored after 5-aza treatment.
   No changes were found with TSA. MS-PCR of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA
   showed a correlation between the reduced expression of p14(ARF) and the
   presence of hypermethylated promoter. No amplification was observed in
   the DNA treated with the McrBc enzyme, corroborating promoter
   hypermethylation. p14(ARF)-hypermethylated IPF fibroblasts were
   significantly more resistant to staurosporine-and
   S-nitrosoglutathione-induced apoptosis compared with normal and
   nonmethylated IPF fibroblasts (P < 0.01) and showed reduced levels of
   p53. Resistance to apoptosis was provoked in fibroblasts when p14(ARF)
   expression was inhibited by siRNA (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate
   that many IPF fibroblasts have reduced expression of the proapoptotic
   p14(ARF) attributable to promoter hypermethylation and indicate that
   epigenetic mechanisms may underlie their resistance to apoptosis.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fish wastes has been used for many years as an alternative
   in feeds for aquaculture. In the present study weight gain of juvenile
   white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei fed diets including fish waste silage
   (WS), fish waste silage with soybean meal SBM (WS + S) or fish waste
   meal (WM) was compared. A conventional acidic silage process was applied
   to obtain from wastes (skin, heads, bones and viscera) of snapper
   (Lutjanus spp.), grunt (Haemulon plumieri), and grouper (Epinephelus
   spp.) an ingredient rich in protein. RESULTS: After 3 days ensilage more
   than 90\% protein was hydrolysed. Waste material processed at pH 3.8
   lost about 24\% tryptophan. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) prevented
   lipid oxidation, as shown after 45 days with malonaldehyde production.
   Shrimp fed WS + S diet gained 0.7 g per week higher than those fed WS
   and WM diets with 0.3 g per week (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: WS processed
   with formic acid under conditions of low pH is beneficial for the white
   shrimp L. vannamei. It sustained reasonable weight gain combined with
   soybean meal in practical diets. On the other hand, BHT addition was
   beneficial in preventing oxidative action during silage preparation.

Abstract = {In Mycena sectio Calodontes with otherwise amyloid spores, the inamyloid
   spores of Mycena pearsoniana Dennis ex Singer were a distinguishing
   feature for this species and its subsection Violacella. Although the
   original concept of this species was European, Singer chose to typify it
   with material collected in Mexico. The name has since been applied to
   all European collections with inamyloid spores and decurrent lamellae.
   Our phylogenetic analysis of 91 ITS sequences from European, North and
   South American Calodontes collections shows that European collections
   identified as M. pearsoniana fall into two well-supported sibling clades
   together with both inamyloid and weakly amyloid North American
   collections. Since the holotype of M. pearsoniana is in an advanced
   state of decay, we have selected an epitype from a North American
   locality with a climate comparable to the Mexican type locality. Our
   results show weakly and inamyloid spore reactions to be homoplastic in
   Calodontes, and furthermore that spores of M. pearsoniana can show
   either amyloid or inamyloid reactions interchangeably. This raises doubt
   about the taxonomic value of this trait in Mycena systematics.},

Abstract = {The effect of salinity and temperature regimes, typical of most
   contrasting periods of the annual cycle (warm and cold) at Tamiahua
   lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico, on food consumption, body composition and
   allometric relationships of juveniles of the brown shrimp
   Farfantepenaeus aztecus (Ives, 1891) were examined. The following
   morphometric and tissue composition parameters were measured: total
   length (TL), cephalothorax length (CL), wet weight (WW), dry weight
   (DW), \% body water content, organic matter (OM), total minerals (TM)
   and energy content (EC). The digestive tract of shrimps collected from
   both warm and cold periods was analysed determining its composition,
   quantity, and caloric content of the ingested food. Allometric
   relationships were calculated among: DW-WW, WW-TL and CL-TL. OM and TM
   content were correlated with the shrimp's body weight. During the cold
   and warm seasons, salinity fluctuated between 24 and 36 psu and 12-36
   psu, and average temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively.
   WW-TL and CL-TL relationships were statistically different among shrimps
   from both seasons. Body water content varied significantly, altering the
   DW-WW relationship, being higher in the warm season. No significant
   seasonal variation was detected in the shrimp's OM, TM and EC. A shift
   in shrimp feeding habits was distinguished in the two seasons examined.
   Carnivorous habits prevail in winter whilst herbivory is more frequently
   observed during the warm season. However, the food energy remained
   relatively stable in both seasons, indicating that shrimp consume
   available resources in the lagoon in order to compensate for the absence
   of other food components and thus to maintain a constant energy flow
   independent of the season.},

Title = {Biogeographical analysis of two Polypodium species complexes

Abstract = {We analyzed the geographical and elevational distributions of two
   Polypodium complexes from Mexico and Central America. Distribution data
   of nine species of the Polypodium colpodes complex and the Polypodium
   plesiosorum complex were obtained from almost 1500 herbarium specimens,
   field collections in Mexico and Costa Rica, and literature studies. The
   presence of each species was recorded for each Mesoamerican country, in
   1 degrees x 1 degrees grid-cells and biogeographical provinces. The
   rarity of species was also evaluated. Although the two complexes show
   extensive overlap, the P. colpodes complex is distributed mainly along
   the Pacific versant of Mexico and Central America, whereas the P.
   plesiosorum complex occurs mainly along the Atlantic versant. Those
   biogeographical provinces with maximum species diversity are Chiapas
   (seven species), Sierra Madre del Sur (six species), and the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt (six species). Grid-cells with more species
   are located mainly in the mountains of central-southern Mexico and
   northern Central America. Richness does not decrease or increase with
   latitude. Elevation distributions showed that most Polypodium species
   are concentrated in the montane interval and three species groups were
   recognized based on elevational preferences. Polypodium colpodes and P.
   plesiosorum are the most widely distributed species, whereas Polypodium
   castaneum and Polypodium flagellare are the only two species that
   possess the three attributes of rarity (narrow geographical
   distribution, high habitat specificity, and scarce local populations).
   Polypodium species of both complexes are present mainly in the montane
   regions of the study area and show some degree of geographical sympatry,
   especially in southern Mexico and northern Central America. This
   overlapping is explained by the elevation tolerance within montane
   systems and because most species inhabit three or more vegetation types.
   The distributional patterns of these complexes coincided with the three
   regional highlands of Mesoamerica, which are separated from each other
   by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and by the lowlands of Nicaragua. (c) 2012

Abstract = {Within the BCS framework a model with d-wave symmetry is introduced to
   describe high-T-c superconductor cuprates. The electron-phonon
   interaction is considered as the dominant cause of superconductivity. In
   order to increase the electronic density of states at the Fermi level,
   an anomalous occupation, has been proposed. The phonon available energy
   is introduced by the half-breathing phonons. Numerical results for the
   coupling parameter lambda, the energy gap Delta(0), and parameters of
   the model, as a function of doping, in the (0.105, 0.22) range, are
   obtained for the cuprate La-2 Sr-x(x) CuO4. The lambda values obtained
   are in the intermediate and the weak coupling region and the
   experimental results for the gap Delta(0) are reproduced with our model.

Abstract = {Species of Floridosentis (Acanthocephala) are common parasites of
   mullets (Mugil spp., Mugilidae) found in tropical marine and brackish
   water in the Americas. Floridosentis includes 2 species distributed in
   Mexico, i.e., Floridosentis pacifica, restricted to the Pacific Ocean
   near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, and Floridosentis mugilis, distributed along
   the coast of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. We sampled 18
   populations of F. mugilis and E pacifica (12 from the Pacific and 6 from
   the Gulf of Mexico) and sequenced a fragment of the rDNA large subunit
   to evaluate phylogenetic relationships of populations of Floridosentis
   spp. from Mexico. Species identification of museum specimens of F.
   mugilis from the Pacific Ocean was confirmed by examination of
   morphology traits. Phylogenetic trees inferred with maximum parsimony,
   maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference indicate that Floridosentis
   is monophyletic comprising of 2 major well-supported clades, the first
   clade corresponding to F mugilis from the Gulf of Mexico, and the second
   to F. pacifica from the Pacific Ocean. Genetic divergence between
   species ranged from 7.68 to 8.60\%. Intraspecific divergence ranged from
   0.14 to 0.86\% for F. mugilis and from 1.72 to 4.49\% for F. pacifica.
   Data obtained from diagnostic characters indicate that specimens from
   the Pacific Ocean in Mexico have differences in some traits among
   locations. These results are consistent with the phylogenetic
   hypothesis, indicating that F pacifica is distributed in the Pacific
   Ocean in Mexico with 3 major lineages.},

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {We examined general and family-specific patterns of vascular plant
   richness along a large elevational gradient (0-3,670 m a.s.l.), assessed
   the continuity of these patterns and analysed their potential underlying
   causes in a high diversity region of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Oaxaca,
   Mexico. We used a vascular plant database constructed previously. The
   gradient was divided into 18 200-m elevation belts. To examine
   elevational patterns of richness, we used both observed and estimated
   (interpolated) species richness, as well as genus and family observed
   richness, for each belt. A generalised linear model (GLM) was used to
   assess the effect of altitude on area-corrected species richness
   (standard area = 100 km(2)), and a numerical classification of the
   elevational belts based on species richness was performed. Overall,
   richness at the three taxonomic levels decreased with elevation, but
   some individual families departed from this pattern. A sharp drop in
   species richness was observed at 1,800 m, and the dendrogram separated
   two elevational floristic groups at this elevation. The GLM revealed a
   significant negative effect of elevation on species richness. Despite
   this overall decreasing pattern for vascular plants along this extensive
   gradient, an examination of some family-specific patterns revealed the
   existence of other elevation-diversity relationships, indicating
   taxon-specific responses to elevation. The most noticeable discontinuity
   in species richness, at ca. 1,800 m, is likely related to a critical
   temperature isocline.},

Abstract = {Gender is one of the main variables that influence the distribution of
   local knowledge. We carried out a literature review concerning local
   mycological knowledge, paying special attention to data concerning
   women's knowledge and comparative gender data. We found that unique
   features of local mycological knowledge allow people to successfully
   manage mushrooms. Women are involved in every stage of mushroom
   utilization from collection to processing and marketing. Local
   mycological knowledge includes the use mushrooms as food, medicine, and
   recreational objects as well as an aid to seasonal household economies.
   In many regions of the world, women are often the main mushroom
   collectors and possess a vast knowledge about mushroom taxonomy,
   biology, and ecology. Local experts play a vital role in the
   transmission of local mycological knowledge. Women participate in the
   diffusion of this knowledge as well as in its enrichment through
   innovation. Female mushroom collectors appreciate their mycological
   knowledge and pursue strategies and organization to reproduce it in
   their communities. Women mushroom gatherers are conscious of their
   knowledge, value its contribution in their subsistence systems, and
   proudly incorporate it in their cultural identity.},

Title = {Sustained low marine sulfate concentrations from the Neoproterozoic to
   the Cambrian: Insights from carbonates of northwestern Mexico and
   eastern California},

Abstract = {Stratigraphic carbonate-carbon isotope trends are similar for
   correlative Ediacaran and Cambrian carbonates of Sonora, Mexico, and
   Death Valley, California. In contrast, the sulfur isotope compositions
   of both carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and pyrite in the two regions
   exhibit unique trends with high degrees of stratigraphic variability. We
   have established that the sulfur records are coeval using delta C-13
   chemostratigraphy and biostratigraphic markers, where present. Over
   short stratigraphic intervals, delta S-34(CAS) variability is consistent
   with regionally low marine sulfate concentrations during this period.
   Values of Delta S-34(delta S-34(CAS)-delta S-34(pyr)) range from -5.8
   parts per thousand to +27.1 parts per thousand and average similar to+11
   parts per thousand, consistent with limited net fractionation during
   bacterial sulfate reduction, which is additional evidence for low
   sulfate concentrations. Modeling based on these regional sulfur isotope
   trends suggests sustained low sulfate conditions throughout the
   Neoproterozoic and well into the Cambrian, with concentrations of
   similar to 2 mM or lower.
   When all of the available sulfate proxy data from our work and
   previously published studies are considered, most Neoproterozoic and
   Cambrian successions exhibit trends consistent with low seawater
   sulfate. The persistent and complete disagreement in delta S-34(sulfate)
   among multiple basins was briefly interrupted similar to 580 million
   years ago, coincident with the onset of the Wonoka-Shuram carbon isotope
   anomaly and again near the termination of Series 3 of the Cambrian
   characteristics generally unrecognized in older rock units. During these
   two intervals, similar stratigraphic trends in delta S-34(CAS) are
   recorded globally, whereas absolute values remain distinct among
   individual basins. However, these periods of broad isotopic trend
   agreement coincide with large-magnitude sulfur isotope excursions, which
   also point to low seawater sulfate concentrations. Therefore, although
   brief intervals of isotopic homogeneity exist, the Neoproterozoic and
   Cambrian ocean must have been dominated by low sulfate throughout.
   Ultimately, the recognition of persistently low sulfate well into the
   Paleozoic raises questions about the relationships between sulfate
   concentration in seawater and its primary controls, including ocean
   oxygenation and its influence on metazoan evolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   diversification of highland species, and a close relationship among

Abstract = {We first describe the numerical invariants and the curvature hyperbola
   attached to the second fundamental form of a timelike surface in
   four-dimensional Minkowski space: beside the four natural invariants, a
   new invariant appears at some special points of the surface, which are
   said to be quasi-umbilic; at such quasi-umbilic points, the curvature
   hyperbola degenerates to a line with one point removed. We then study
   the asymptotic lines on a timelike surface, and characterize the
   quasi-umbilic points of the surface as the points where the asymptotic
   directions degenerate to a double lightlike line. We also give an
   interpretation of the new invariant at a quasi-umbilic point, using the
   Gauss map of the surface. We finally describe the timelike surfaces
   which are quasi-umbilic at every point. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In the interphase nucleus of metazoan cells DNA is organized in
   supercoiled loops anchored to a nuclear matrix (NM). DNA loops are
   operationally classified in structural and facultative. Varied evidence
   indicates that DNA replication occurs in replication foci organized upon
   the NM and that structural DNA loops may correspond to the replicons in
   vivo. In normal rat liver the hepatocytes are arrested in GO but
   synchronously re-enter the cell cycle after partial-hepatectomy leading
   to liver regeneration. Using this model we have previously determined
   that the DNA loops corresponding to a gene-rich genomic region move in a
   sequential fashion towards the NM during replication and then return to
   their original configuration in newly quiescent cells, once liver
   regeneration has been achieved. In the present work we determined the
   organization into structural DNA loops of a gene-poor region centered on
   c-myc and tracked-down its movement at the peak of S phase and after the
   return to cellular quiescence during and after liver regeneration. The
   results confirmed that looped DNA moves towards the NM during
   replication but in this case the configuration of the gene-poor region
   into DNA loops becomes reorganized and after replication only the loop
   containing c-myc resembles the original in the control GO hepatocytes.
   Our results suggest that the local chromatin configuration around
   potentially active genes constraints the formation of specific
   structural DNA loops after DNA replication, while in non-coding regions
   the structural DNA loops are only loosely determined after DNA
   replication by structural constraints that modulate the DNA-NM
   interactions. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 2451-2463, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {We studied the histologic and stereological changes induced in the right
   ovary of newly hatched chicks treated with LH during their embryonic
   development. Results indicate that LH administration causes a diminution
   in size and total volume (P < 0.01) of the right ovary, as well as a
   decrease in the total volume of lacunar channels, blood vessels, and
   interstitium. Other changes obtained after LH treatment were a reduction
   (P < 0.001) in the number of germ cells, as well as an increase in the
   total volume of interstitial cell cords (P < 0.01). This expansion is
   due to the increase of cellular volume of interstitial cells (P < 0.001)
   and not to their number, which decrease in the LH-treated right ovary.
   All these modifications were similar to those occurring in the
   regressing right ovary during development. The findings suggest that the
   right ovary of the newly hatched chick is able to respond to LH
   treatment during embryonic development, inducing marked histologic
   changes that accelerate its regression. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Changes in metabolite levels in hemolymph and hepatopancreas were used
   as indicators of physiological status of juvenile wild and cultivated
   Farfantepenaeas. duorarum (Burkenroad, 1939), during
   hyper-osmoregulatory conditions (salinity 22 ppt, 726 mOsm/kg). We
   analyzed the relationship between biochemical changes of wild and
   cultivated shrimp at different molt stages by measurement of osmotic
   capacity, hemocyanin, acylglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, glycogen and
   total protein. Biochemical analyses of hemolymph (blood) and
   hepatopancreas showed a decreasing trend in stages closer to molt and an
   increasing trend before intermolt. Osmotic capacity and blood proteins
   indicated a significant effect of the molt stage. Stages A. D1' and D'''
   showed the greatest effect on the biochemical variables. Higher
   hemocyanin, cholesterol and glycogen concentrations were observed in
   wild shrimp than in cultivated shrimp. The effect of the molt cycle was
   associated with changes in cyclic ions and water balance that produced
   chemical changes in the hemolymph in both wild and cultivated.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to test the effect of soy protein (SPC), wheat
   gluten (WHG) and potato protein (PPC), in vitro and in vivo
   digestibility of protein and energy in the juveniles Litopeneaus
   vannamei. A completely random design was used with nine 400-L tanks
   (with three repetitions by treatment). Ten respirometric chambers
   (500mL) were used for energy distribution. In vitro digestibility for
   SPC (8.8\%) was higher than for PPC (5.8\%) and for WHG (4.3\%, P<0.05).
   Diets degree of hydrolysis ranged between 0.75\% and 1.2\%, with lowest
   value in potato protein concentrate diet (0.75 +/- 0.09\%, P<0.05). No
   significant differences were obtained in apparent digestibility
   coefficient (ADC) for protein (63.474.1\%). ADC for amino acids ranged
   between 80\% and 90\%. Daily growth coefficient ranged from 0.86\% to
   1.1\% day-1, being the best in soybean protein concentrate diet (SPCd)
   (P<0.05). Significant differences on heat increment were observed
   (P<0.05); highest value was in wheat gluten diet (1.0 +/- 0.1kJ shrimp
   day-1) that coincided with a peak of trypsin specific activity (16.5 +/-
   3.7mU mg similar to protein-1). Highest retained energy for growth was
   observed in shrimp fed SPCd (0.7 +/- 0.03kJday-1, P<0.05). Muscle
   collagen content presented a minimum of bands with SPCd, whereas shrimp
   post-mortem collagenase activity was not affected by any of the three
   diets (P>0.05).},

Title = {Research on arbuscular mycorrhizae in Mexico: an historical synthesis

Abstract = {This review analyzes the historical development and advances of the
   research on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in Mexico, as well as the
   prospects for future research. AMF-research has been focused on studying
   both diversity and functionality in several ecosystems of Mexico, but
   mainly in the tropical dry and rainy ecosystems, and the agricultural
   systems. In Mexico, 95 species of AMF have been recorded, representing
   41\% of the known species worldwide. The functional effects of AMF
   colonization have been examined in approximately 10\% of the known host
   plants, but greenhouse studies continue to dominate over those conducted
   under field conditions. Even though research to date has been at the
   organismic level, further effort is needed due to the high plant
   diversity in Mexico. Studies on AMF biomass under field conditions and
   more taxonomic determination are required based on morphological
   features, biochemical determinations (fatty acids) and molecular tools.
   In addition, ecophysiological and ecological in situ studies would help
   in understanding the relationships among AMF, soil fauna, nutrients, and
   host plants. The contribution of AMF to ecosystemic processes is a
   priority line of research that requires an integrated approach (inter-
   and multidisciplinary) in order to define the role of AM symbioses for
   biogeochemical models. The creation of a Mexican mycorrhizal research
   network has and will help to identify the main challenges. Generating
   similar research protocols, and sharing databases and experience will
   assist mycorrhizologists working under the diverse financial and
   ecological contexts that is to be found in Mexico and Latin America.},

Abstract = {In the present study, digestive dynamics, measured through the changes
   in the in situ pH along the digestive tract, was evaluated along with
   the glycogen concentration in the digestive gland (DG) and the
   proteolytic enzyme activity of the gastric juice (GJ) (both acid and
   alkaline proteases) to obtain useful information that will allow for the
   understanding of the DG's function and the role that it plays as an
   extracellular digestive enzyme source and for energy storage, providing
   new information on the digestive physiology of Octopus maya. The results
   showed that pH along the digestive tract changed according to the
   postprandial time following the food transit. At the beginning, the pH
   on crop (St) was 5, changing to 6 when the food arrived. Similar changes
   were observed on the caecum (Ce) and DG. Glycogen from DG is used as a
   source of energy during digestion and recovered 8 h after feeding.
   Maximum activities of digestive gland GJ enzymes were observed 6 h after
   feeding, indicating that chyme enzymes are still active when they arrive
   at the DG's lumen. The presence of food in the digestive tract modifies
   the pH, which, in combination with GJ, favours the activity of the
   released enzymes of O. maya.},

Abstract = {Tillandsia recurvata is an epiphytic bromeliad with a wide distribution
   in the Americas; however, little is known about the development of its
   post-seminal adaptations for survival in epiphytic environments. The
   purpose of this study was to define the temperature and water
   requirements for the germination of T. recurvata seeds. The absence of
   radicle emergence in T. recurvata seeds resulted in 2 stages of
   germination: swollen with broken seed coat (stage-1) and chlorophyllic
   embryos (stage-2). The effects of partial or discontinuous hydration on
   germinated seed survival were also assessed. The seeds were collected in
   a semi-arid shrubland of Mexico City. We explored: (1) whether water
   vapour can provide a sufficient water source for germination; (2) the
   temperature required for germination stage-1 and the optimal and
   critical osmotic potentials for germination in both germination stages;
   (3) the effect of seed incubation at different osmotic potentials that
   undergo subsequent dehydration on their survival in stage-2; and (4) the
   loss of dehydration tolerance during early post-seminal development. In
   addition, an image of T. recurvata seed anatomy was obtained to
   illustrate its structures. Germination stage-1 of T. recurvata seeds is
   rather similar across the tested temperature range. The seeds required
   to be in contact with liquid water to germinate. The interval of osmotic
   potential facilitating both germination stages was from 0 to -0.6 MPa.
   Although germinated seeds displayed dehydration tolerance, this
   tolerance decreased in germination stage-2. The osmotic potential during
   germination affected the tolerance of the chlorophyllic embryos
   (stage-2) to subsequent dehydration.},

   compare the frequency of mention of each species between males and
   females, and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the difference in
   the total number of fungi mentioned by either gender. Traditional names
   for mushroom species were documented and frequency of mention assessed
   through multivariate statistics. The fungi with highest frequency of
   mention were Amanita basii, Lyophyllum decastes, Boletus pinophilus,
   Gomphus floccosus and Cantharellus cibarius complex. We found
   significant differences in the frequency of mention of different fungi
   by males and females but no significant difference was found for the
   total number of fungi mentioned by either gender. Principal component
   analysis suggested a cultural regionalization of La Malinche volcano
   communities based on preferences for consumption and use of traditional
   names. We observed two groups: one formed by communities on the eastern
   part of the volcano (with mixed cultures) and the other including
   communities on the western slope (ethnic Nahua towns). San Isidro
   Buensuceso is the most distinct community, according to the criteria in
   this study.},

Title = {Inception of maleness: auxin contribution to flower masculinization in
   the dioecious cactus Opuntia stenopetala},
Journal = {PLANTA},

Volume = {236},

Abstract = {In Opuntia stenopetala, flowers initiate as hermaphrodite; however, at
   maturity, only the stamens in male flowers and the gynoecium in female
   flowers become functional. At early developmental stages, growth and
   morphogenesis of the gynoecium in male flowers cease, forming a short
   style lacking stigmatic tissue at maturity. Here, an analysis of the
   masculinization process of this species and its relationship with auxin
   metabolism during gynoecium morphogenesis is presented. Histological
   analysis and scanning electron microscopy were performed; auxin levels
   were immunoanalyzed and exogenous auxin was applied to developing
   gynoecia. Male flower style-tissue patterning revealed morphological
   defects in the vascular bundles, stylar canal, and transmitting tissue.
   These features are similar to those observed in Arabidopsis thaliana
   mutant plants affected in auxin transport, metabolism, or signaling.
   Notably, when comparing auxin levels between male and female gynoecia
   from O. stenopetala at an early developmental stage, we found that they
   were particularly low in the male gynoecium. Consequently, exogenous
   auxin application on male gynoecia partially restored the defects of
   gynoecium development. We therefore hypothesize that, the arrest in male
   flower gynoecia patterning could be related to altered auxin
   homeostasis; alternatively, the addition of auxin could compensate for
   the lack of another unknown factor affecting male flower gynoecium
   development.},

Number = {3361},

Abstract = {Insect life stages are known imperfectly in many cases, and
   classifications are usually based on adult morphology. This is
   unfortunate as information on other life stages may be useful for
   biomonitoring. The major impediment to using elmid ( Coleoptera) larvae
   for freshwater biomonitoring is the lack of larval descriptions and
   illustrations. Reliable molecular protocols may be used to associate
   larvae and adults. After adults of seven species of Mexican Macrelmis
   were identified morphologically, seven larval specimens were associated
   to them based on two gene fragments: Cox1 and Cob. The phylogenetic
   analysis allowed identifying the larval specimens as Macrelmis leonilae,
   M. scutellaris, M. species 7, M. species 10, and M. species 11. Two
   species based on adults associated uncertainly with one larva, and one
   larva did not match with any adult. Adult/larval association in elmids
   using DNA sequence data seems to be promising in terms of speed and
   reliability.},

Title = {Structure and evolution of strange attractors in non-elastic triangular
   billiards},
Journal = {CHAOS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We study non-elastic billiard dynamics in an equilateral triangular
   table. In such dynamics, collisions with the walls of the table are not
   elastic, as in standard billiards; rather, the outgoing angle of the
   trajectory with the normal vector to the boundary at the point of
   collision is a uniform factor lambda < 1 smaller than the incoming
   angle. This leads to contraction in phase space for the discrete-time
   dynamics between consecutive collisions, and hence to attractors of zero
   Lebesgue measure, which are almost always fractal strange attractors
   with chaotic dynamics, due to the presence of an expansion mechanism. We
   study the structure of these strange attractors and their evolution as
   the contraction parameter lambda is varied. For lambda is an element of
   (0, 1/3), we prove rigorously that the attractor has the structure of a
   Cantor set times an interval, whereas for larger values of lambda gaps
   arise in the Cantor structure. For lambda close to 1, the attractor
   splits into three transitive components, whose basins of attraction have
   fractal boundaries. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {Planck-scale effects on Bose-Einstein condensates},
Journal = {EPL},
Year = {2012},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The effects of a Planck-scale deformation of the Minkowski
   energy-momentum dispersion relation on the phenomenology of non-trapped
   Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are examined. Such a deformation is
   shown to cause a shift in the condensation temperature T-c of the BEC
   and, for a specific functional form of deformation, this shift can be as
   large as the current measured precision on T-c. For a Rb-85(37)
   cold-atom BEC with a particle density n similar or equal to 10(12)cm(-3)
   we find a fractional shift of order 10(-4), but this can be much larger
   for even more dilute BECs. We discuss the possibility of planning
   specific experiments with BECs that might provide phenomenological
   constraints on Planck-scale physics. These corrections to T-c are found
   to be extremely small for ultrarelativistic BECs implying that, in some
   cases, Planck-scale effects may be more important in low-rather than
   high-energy processes. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2012},

Abstract = {The seed bank structure in the semiarid valley of Zapotitlan, Puebla was
   studied. The record of the composition and abundance of the seed bank
   was conducted in 2 types of vegetation (tetechera and thorny scrub) in
   the microhabitats (under shrubs, open space and refuse- dumps of
   granivorous ants Pogonomyrmex barbatus). Seed collection was carried out
   in dry, rainy and late rainy seasons for 2 years. There were no
   differences in seed density between seasons and years, but there were
   differences between microhabitats evaluated. The microhabitat of the ant
   refuse-dumps had the highest abundance of seeds, which highlights the
   importance of ants in the spatial conformation of the structure of
   communities in these ecosystems. Seeds of 38 species of plants were
   recorded. The average density ranged from 23 800 to 28 000 seeds m(-2),
   consistent with other reports for arid and semiarid regions. The most
   frequent species were the annual Eragrostis mexicana, Bouteloua barbata,
   Kallstroemia rosei and Portulaca pilosa. Results show that this area had
   a high heterogeneity at site and microhabitat level. It is necessary to
   conduct more studies on spatio-temporal patterns in seed banks and their
   relationship with the standing vegetation in arid and semiarid areas in
   Mexico.},

   We recorded the presence of 436 species (of 440 estimated) with the
   information of database. Five species are endemic to Mexico and 17
   quasiendemic. Mexican endemics are distributed in Cozumel Island and in
   the northwestern portion of the peninsula, in dryer areas with tropical
   dry forest. Quasiendemic species are distributed in the southeastern
   portion of the peninsula, mainly in areas with high humidity. Similarity
   analysis lead to the recognition of 4 major areas, one in the north of

Title = {Pedogenic, lithogenic - or anthropogenic origin of Cr, Ni and V in soils
   near a petrochemical facility in Southeast Mexico},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {49-57},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large Cr, V and Ni contents were found in soils near Cd. Pemex in
   Tabasco, Mexico. Their origin was hypothesized to be either
   anthropogenic, derived from emissions of a petrochemical facility, cr
   lithogenic, From the volcanic ash deposited by the ``El Chichon{''}
   volcano, or accumulated residually by pecogenesis. We proved these
   possible origins by analyzing composite samples taken from the soil
   surface at different distances from the facility as well as samples from
   two soil profiles located close and far away from the facility within
   the same land unit, i.e. Acrisols developed on Miocene marine terraces.
   The sites located far away from the facility were closer to the volcano,
   and therefore supposedly more affected by the ash deposition. All
   samples were analyzed for their total metal content and profile samples
   for their different metal fractions. Additionally the soil
   microstructure, mineralogy and elemental composition of particular
   pedogenic features were studied in thin sections from the different soil
   horizons.
   Results evidenced that the emissions from the petrochemical facility do
   not contribute significantly to the total concentration of Cr, Ni and V
   in the adjacent soils. Nickel was found in the soil in concentrations
   between 39 and 318 mg kg 1; particularly large contents of this element
   were associated to volcanic ash additions visualized in the thin
   sections. Micromorphological analyses of nodule like pebbles found in
   both profiles evidenced that these features are laterite fragments
   transported from preexisting soil. The matrix of these fragments is
   enriched with Cr and V (3000-7000 mg kg(-1) of Cr, and 1000-3000 mg
   kg(-1) V), and these elements are actually translocated into relatively
   newly formed iron concretiors found within these laterites and reaching
   concentrations of up to 10,000-17,000 mg kg(-1) Cr.
   The fractionation showed that Cr and V were dominantly associated to
   crystalline iron oxides and to the residual fraction; water extractable,
   exchangeable and EDTA extractable fractions were below detection limits
   (<2 mg kg(-1)). Only Ni was extractable with NH4-acetate in the profile
   affected by volcanic ash in concentrations between 3.4 and 6.3 mg
   kg(-1).
   We conclude that the studied elements are of lithogenic and pedogenic
   origin; they were enriched dominantly through residual accumulation by
   lateritization, probably of mesozoic ultramafic rocks from the margins
   of the Caribbean plate, and later fragmented and transported by water to
   the present location; only Ni was also partly added by the recent
   volcanic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fire causes a reduction of plant cover due to the death of several
   structures, especially of those that are not isolated from high
   temperatures; such as seeds and fruits. After a disturbance the
   availability of diaspores is crucial for the recovery of the community.
   This work studied the composition and abundance of the seed rain in the
   xerophytic shrubland of the Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve,
   located at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico campus in Mexico
   City, which was affected by a surface fire. In order to understand the
   role of diaspores in the natural regeneration of a burned site, seed
   traps were placed on 2 sites, one affected by the fire and the other in
   an unburned location. During 1 year the dispersed seeds and fruits were
   collected and identified. Results showed that species richness, life
   forms, and dispersal syndromes were different between sites. The highest
   abundance and richness values were observed in the burned site. This
   work offers basic data on the availability of species as diaspores,
   information which is useful for potential restoration strategies
   especially in those areas under constant anthropogenic disturbances.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to characterize at fine scale alpha and beta
   diversity patterns for Mexican amphibians and analyze how these patterns
   might change under a moderate climate-change scenario, highlighting the
   overall consequences for amphibian diversity at the country level. We
   used a geo-referenced database gathered from museums worldwide as a
   basis for climatic envelope models, based on the working assumptions
   that we can accurately model the ecological niche, niche conservatism,
   and that the future climate scenario is realistic. We generated six sets
   of models with different parameters (threshold of presence and dispersal
   capability) in the modelling processes. We simulated the base line
   (2000) and future scenarios for Mexican amphibian diversity (2020, 2050,
   2080), using climate data layers constructed for Mexico. Using
   moving-window analyses of different sizes (9, 25, 100, 225 and 400
   km(2)) we calculated beta diversity with R.H. Whittaker's formula beta =
   gamma/alpha(mean). We analyzed the changes of alpha- and beta-diversity
   spatial patterns during these periods, and performed an analysis of
   sensitivity for the beta-diversity patterns. We found that setting low
   dispersal capability generates high levels of species extinctions, but
   the overall geographic pattern of beta diversity remained stable. Zones
   of high beta diversity resulted that were associated with topographic
   formations, while the values of beta diversity initially increased, and
   then declined over time. Extinctions (complete loss of range within
   country boundaries) were particularly intense during the period
   2020-2050. The results implied that heterogeneous zones associated with
   mountain ranges will remain particularly important for amphibian
   diversity and thus constitute areas for continued conservation
   prioritization in the face of climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Hemispheric asymmetries of functional connectivity and grey matter

Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1308-1315},

Abstract = {Resting state networks such as the default mode network have been widely
   reported. Although a plethora of information on its functional relevance
   has been generated, little is known about lateralization or hemisphere
   asymmetry within the DMN. We used high-resolution resting state fMRI and
   T1 3D data to investigate such asymmetries in two groups of healthy
   subjects, one right-handed and one left-handed. Independent component
   analysis and the dual regression approach were carried out to identify
   functional asymmetries, while voxel-based morphometry was used to
   identify structural asymmetries in grey matter volume within the DMN.
   Greater leftward functional connectivity was observed in the posterior
   cingulate gyrus (PCG) for both groups. Leftward functional asymmetry was
   observed in the thalamus and rightward functional asymmetries were
   observed in the middle frontal and middle/superior temporal gyrus in the
   right-handed group. Rightward asymmetries in grey matter volume were
   observed in the posterior portion of the PCG for both groups. The
   right-handed group exhibited leftward structural asymmetries in the
   anterior portion of the PCG and in the middle frontal and posterior
   portion of the middle temporal gyrus, while rightward asymmetries were
   observed in the posterior portion of the PCG and anterior portions of
   temporal regions. These results suggest that functional connectivity and
   grey matter volume are not equally distributed between hemispheres
   within the DMN, and that functional asymmetries are not always reflected
   or determined by structural asymmetries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {A 30-day trial was performed to evaluate the reproductive performance of
   wild and 2nd generation domesticated Farfantepenaeus duorarum
   broodstock. Changes in biochemical composition and fatty acids (FA)
   profile in the 1st and 4th spawn order females were used as indicators
   of nutritional condition. Wild population of F. duorarum presented
   significantly better reproductive outcomes as compared to domesticated
   ones. Wild spawners achieved significantly higher number of eggs per
   spawn, number of egg per spawn per g of spawner's body weight and number
   of nauplii per spawn (P<0.05). Latency period was significantly shorter
   (P<0.05) for wild than for domesticated females (11 vs 17 days). Wild
   spawners also presented less mortality (6 vs 12\%), higher number of
   total spawns (51 vs 33), spawns per ablated and per spawning females as
   well as higher total eggs and nauplii production. On the other hand,
   domesticated females presented higher number of females that spawned at
   least once (89 vs 76\%). The higher spawning activity was reflected in
   lower levels of acylglycerides (AG) and cholesterol content in wild
   hepatopancreas (HP) and ovary (OV) (P<0.05). FA profile, mainly
   represented by ARA, EPA and sum of n-3 were higher in hepatopancreas and
   ovary of wild females, however lower levels were detected in eggs as a
   result of a high spawning activity. Multivariate analysis performed to
   detected simultaneous variation in biochemical variables indicated AG as
   variation pattern's responsive. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Configurations Dominate S1 States of Bis-BODIPYs},

Abstract = {S-0, S-1, and T-1 states of various orthogonal 8,8' and
   8,2'-bis-boradiaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) dyes, recently (Angew. Chem, Int.
   Ed. 2011, 50, 11937) proposed as heavy atom free photosensitizers for
   O-2((1)Delta(g)) generation, were studied by multireference quantum
   chemical approaches. S-0 -> S-1 excitation characteristics of certain
   bis-BODIPYs are shown to be drastically different than the parent BODIPY
   chromophore. Whereas a simple HOMO -> LUMO-type single substitution
   perfectly accounts for the BODIPY core, S-1 states of certain orthogonal
   bis-BODIPYs are described as linear combinations of doubly substituted
   (DS) configurations which overall yield four electrons in four singly
   occupied orbitals. Computed DS character of S-1, strongly correlated
   with facile O-1(2) production, was presumed to occur via S-1 -> T-1
   intersystem crossing (ISC) of the sensitizer. Further confirmation of
   this relation was provided by newly synthesized BODIPY derivatives and
   comparison of spectroscopic properties of their dimers and monomers.
   Near-IR absorption, desired for potential photodynamic therapy
   applications, was not pursuable for bis-chromophores by the standard
   strategy of pi-extension, as DS singlet states are destabilized.
   Decreased exchange coupling in pi-extended cases appears to be
   responsible for this destabilization. Comparisons with iodine
   incorporated bis-BODIPYs suggest that the dynamics of O-1(2) generation
   via DS S-1 states are qualitatively different from that via ISC
   originating from heavy atom spin orbit coupling. Although red-shifting
   the absorption wavelength to enter the therapeutic window does not seem
   attainable for orthogonal BODIPYs with DS S-1 states, modifications in
   the chromophore cores are shown to be promising in fine-tuning the
   excitation characteristics.},

Abstract = {Blue-tailed skinks (genus Plestiodon) are a common component of the
   terrestrial herpetofauna throughout their range in eastern Eurasia and
   North and Middle America. Plestiodon species are also frequent subjects
   of ecological and evolutionary research, yet a comprehensive,
   well-supported phylogenetic framework does not yet exist for this genus.
   We construct a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Plestiodon using
   Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of a nine-locus data set comprising 8308
   base pairs of DNA, sampled from 38 of the 43 species in the genus. We
   evaluate potential gene tree/species tree discordance by conducting
   phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated and individual locus data
   sets, as well as employing coalescent-based methods. Specifically, we
   address the placement of Plestiodon within the evolutionary tree of
   Scincidae, as well as the phylogenetic relationships between Plestiodon
   species, and their taxonomy. Given our sampling of major Scincidae
   lineages, we also re-evaluate deep relationships within the family, with
   the goal of resolving relationships that have been ambiguous in recent
   molecular phylogenetic analyses. We infer strong support for several
   scincid relationships, including a major clade of scincines and the
   inter-relationships of major Mediterranean and southern African genera.
   Although we could not estimate the precise phylogenetic affinities of
   Plestiodon with statistically significant support, we nonetheless infer
   significant support for its inclusion in a large scincine clade
   exclusive of Acontinae, Lygosominae, Brachymeles, and Ophiomorus.
   Plestiodon comprises three major geographically cohesive clades. One of
   these clades is composed of mostly large-bodied species inhabiting
   northern Indochina, south-eastern China (including Taiwan), and the
   southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The second clade comprises species
   inhabiting central China (including Taiwan) and the entire Japanese
   archipelago. The third clade exclusively inhabits North and Middle
   America and the island of Bermuda. A vast majority of interspecific
   relationships are strongly supported in the concatenated data analysis,
   but there is nonetheless significant conflict amongst the individual
   gene trees. Coalescent-based gene tree/species tree analyses indicate
   that incongruence amongst the nuclear loci may severely obscure the
   phylogenetic inter-relationships of the primarily small-bodied
   Plestiodon species that inhabit the central Mexican highlands. These
   same analyses do support the sister relationship between Plestiodon
   marginatus Hallowell, 1861 and Plestiodon stimpsonii (Thompson, 1912),
   and differ with the mitochondrial DNA analysis that supports Plestiodon
   elegans (Boulenger, 1887) + P. stimpsonii. Finally, because the existing
   Plestiodon taxonomy is a poor representation of evolutionary
   relationships, we replace the existing supraspecific taxonomy with one
   congruent with our phylogenetic results.},

Abstract = {Background: The recent pandemic influenza AH1N1 virus made it clear that
   planning for medical disaster response is critical. Objective: To know
   the responsiveness of a sample of highly specialized hospitals in Mexico
   to a medical disaster with the previous pandemic influenza AH1N1 as
   reference. Methods: A survey was conducted among the Medical Directors
   of a sample of highly specialized hospitals, covering: previous
   experience with the pandemic influenza, space considerations, material
   resources, staff, logistics, and current general perspectives.
   Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results: A 95\% response
   was obtained from the institutions (19 hospitals). Of these, 47.4\%
   considered that the medical institution was not ready to respond to
   pandemic influenza. The median surge capacity for the Intensive Care
   Unit beds was 30\% (range 0 to 32 beds). The least reserve in medication
   was found in the antivirals (26.3\%). Only 47.4\% considered having
   enough intensive care nurses and 57.9\% enough respiratory technicians;
   42.1\% would not have an easy access to resources in an emergency.
   Conclusions: Prevention is key in responsiveness to medical disasters,
   and therefore the basic steps for planning strategies must be
   considered.},

Abstract = {Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially
   life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma
   cruzi. The main mode of transmission of this disease in endemic areas is
   through an insect vector called triatomine bug. Triatomines become
   infected with T. cruzi by feeding blood of an infected person or animal.
   Chagas disease is considered the most important vector borne infection
   in Latin America. It is estimated that between 16 and 18 millions of
   persons are infected with T. cruzi, and at least 20,000 deaths each
   year.
   In this work we formulate a model for the transmission of this infection
   among humans, vectors and domestic mammals. Our main objective is to
   assess the effectiveness of Chagas disease control measures. For this,
   we do sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R-0 and the
   endemic proportions with respect to epidemiological and demographic
   parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {For a graph G and integer k a parts per thousand yen 1, we define the
   token graph F (k) (G) to be the graph with vertex set all k-subsets of
   V(G), where two vertices are adjacent in F (k) (G) whenever their
   symmetric difference is a pair of adjacent vertices in G. Thus vertices
   of F (k) (G) correspond to configurations of k indistinguishable tokens
   placed at distinct vertices of G, where two configurations are adjacent
   whenever one configuration can be reached from the other by moving one
   token along an edge from its current position to an unoccupied vertex.
   This paper introduces token graphs and studies some of their properties
   including: connectivity, diameter, cliques, chromatic number,
   Hamiltonian paths, and Cartesian products of token graphs.},

Abstract = {The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of revolutionary
   nationalism, of mandatory consensuses and of the institutional
   foundation of modern Mexico, is today a party of control-rooted actions.
   These activities forced the appearance of new leaderships that without
   the leading figure of the almighty president, have taken the lead. There
   has been a do over of order and forced authority redistribution, both
   inside and out the party. Undoubtedly this is another issue that adds to
   the multiplication of epicenters and influence platforms wherefrom power
   is exercised. This way, the paper has the purpose of unveiling some of
   the fundamental changes of PRI, focusing mainly on: 1) the institutional
   come-and-go, leading to the strengthening of the party as one of broader
   openness and transversality; 2) the promotion of local leaders and chief
   executives as bastions for the decision making of the party; and 3) the
   tactical practice in the rearrangement of parliamentary seats.},

Abstract = {Sedum oxypetalum is one of the dominant species in the xerophilous
   shrublands in the lava fields of the Basin of Mexico. Germination of
   this species was evaluated to understand its ecological response. We
   tested the effects of different pre-germination treatments (cold, and
   dry and wet heat) and storage time, as well as those of natural priming
   in two microhabitats with different disturbance levels. Experiments were
   performed in laboratory conditions under constant (25 A degrees C) and
   fluctuating (20/30 A degrees C) temperatures. Seeds did not germinate
   during burial and proved to be positively photoblastic. Under
   pre-germination treatments, final germination percentage was higher at
   20/30 A degrees C in seeds after four or more months of storage. None of
   the pre-germination treatments favored germination. Seeds can survive
   for more than 1 year and form a seed bank. Thus, seeds underwent natural
   priming that favored final germination percentage; however, germination
   rate and lag time were not affected by this process. In natural
   conditions, germination is delayed until the rainy season, improving the
   success of seedling establishment and growth. We discuss the role of
   fluctuating temperature in germination processes and the adaptations of
   seeds to their seasonal environment.},

Abstract = {Based on the superposition of 19 individual tracks of American species
   of the freshwater copepod genus Eucyclops, two generalized tracks were
   found. The Western Amazonian track (southern Peru, eastern Brazil, and
   central Colombia) corresponding to the Amazonian subregion and the South
   American Transition Zone, and the Mesoamerican-Northwestern South
   American track (central Colombia, Central America, and northeastern
   Mexico) corresponding to the Neotropical region, the Mexican Transition
   Zone, and the Nearctic region. One node was found in Colombia, an area
   where both generalized tracks intersect. The distributional patterns of
   Eucyclops apparently involve two cenocrons: one Holarctic, and another
   Paleotropical. The Western Amazonian generalized track can be correlated
   with the existence of rivers that function either as barriers or
   dispersal passageways, the uplift of the Andes, and the presence of the
   Miocene ``Pebas lake/wetland system.{''} The Mesoamerican-Northwestern
   South American generalized track can be associated with climate changes
   resulting from the uplift of North American mountain ranges, the
   presence of marine barriers (Isthmus of Tehuantepec and Panama) and the
   uplift of mountains in southern Mexico and Central America. The closing
   of the marine barrier represented by the Isthmus of Panama seems to have
   been a key event in the northward and southward dispersal of Eucyclops
   in the Americas.},

Title = {Kronecker products and the RSK correspondence},
Journal = {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {312},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1476-1486},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {A matrix M with nonnegative integer entries is minimal if the
   nonincreasing sequence of its entries (called pi-sequence) is minimal,
   in the dominance order of partitions, among all nonincreasing sequences
   of entries of matrices with nonnegative integers that have the same
   1-marginals as A.
   The starting point for this work is an identity that relates the number
   of minimal matrices that have fixed 1-marginals and pi-sequence to a
   linear combination of Kronecker coefficients. In this paper we provide a
   bijection that realizes combinatorially this identity. From this
   bijection we obtain an algorithm that to each minimal matrix associates
   a minimal component, with respect to the dominance order, in a Kronecker
   product, and a combinatorial description of the corresponding Kronecker
   coefficient in terms of minimal matrices and tableau insertion. Our
   bijection follows from a generalization of the dual RSK correspondence
   to 3-dimensional binary matrices, which we state and prove. With the
   same tools we also obtain a generalization of the RSK correspondence to
   3-dimensional integer matrices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Metallic nanoclusters, with one electron or hole difference from closed
   shell, might end up in a degenerate state undergoing a Jahn-Teller
   distortion as a result of nonadiabatic effects, which are a
   manifestation of the electron-vibron coupling. Here, we report a
   theoretical study on the stability and nonadiabaticity of the neutral
   and charged endohedral clusters X@Al-12 (X = B, C, N, Al, Si, P) around
   icosahedral symmetry, for 39, 40, and 41 valence electrons. The
   nonadiabatic effects are evaluated through the Jahn-Teller gain for the
   distorted cluster and their effect Oil the calculated electronic density
   of states is analyzed. For the 40 electron valence systems, we present
   the full vibrational spectra. Our results are discussed within the
   framework of the superatom model, and show that not all systems are well
   described by the spherical jellium model and that nonadiabaticity is
   better represented by ellipsoidal models. We present a detail discussion
   of the Al-13(-1) electron detachment process and show how, through a
   comparison with available experimental photoelectron spectroscopy data,
   the nonadiabaticity can be estimated.},

Title = {First-principles study of electronic, vibrational, elastic, and magnetic
   properties of FeF2 as a function of pressure},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {85},
Number = {13},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {We report systematic ab initio calculations of the electronic band
   structure, phonon dispersion relation, and the structural
   characterization of FeF2 in the rutile (P4(2)/mnm) structure as well as
   in several high-pressure phases by means of the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA) + U approximation. Using the phonon dispersion
   relations, we calculated the Gibbs free energy and evaluated the phase
   transitions at 300 K, at which most experimental measurements are
   performed. Calculated Raman and infrared vibrational modes, lattice
   parameters, and electronic structure for all considered crystalline
   structures are compared with available experimental data. Our
   calculations show that at 5.33 GPa, the FeF2 undergoes a second-order
   proper ferroelastic phase transition, rutile -> CaCl2-type structure.
   This result is supported by the softening of the elastic shear module
   C-s in the rutile phase, the softening (hardening) of the B-1g (A(g))
   Raman active mode in the rutile (CaCl2-type) structure near the
   transition pressure, and the decrease of the square of the spontaneous
   strain e(ss) from the CaCl2-type structure. This demonstrates that the
   rutile -> CaCl2-type phase transition is driven by the coupling between
   the Raman active B-1g mode and shear modulus C-s. At 8.22 GPa, the
   CaCl2-type structure undergoes a first-order phase transition to the
   Pbca phase, a distorted fcc Pa (3) over bar phase with a volume
   reduction of Delta V approximate to 7\%, as reported in experiments.
   Upon further increase of the pressure, the Pbca phase transforms to a
   Fmmm phase othorhombic center-type structure at similar to 20.38 GPa,
   with Delta V approximate to 2.5\%. Finally, at 25.05 GPa, there is a
   phase transition to the orthorhombic cotunnite structure (Pnma space
   group), with Delta V approximate to 5.8\%, which is stable up to 45 GPa,
   the largest considered pressure. The coordination number for the Fe ion
   in each phase is 6, 6, 6, 8, and 9 for rutile, CaCl2-type, Pbca, Fmmm,
   and cotunnite structures, respectively. The evolution of the band gap,
   phonon frequencies, and magnetic moment of Fe ion as a function of the
   applied pressure is reported for all studied phases. The exchange
   constants J(1), J(2), and J(3), calculated for rutile and the lowest
   Gibbs free-energy high-pressure phases, are reported.},

Title = {Effect of temperature on embryonic development of Octopus mimus
   under controlled conditions},

Abstract = {Although the mechanism by which temperature modulates the use of
   reserves and its consequences for organogenesis in octopus species is
   not yet known, there is evidence that temperature modulates the
   embryonic growth rate in cephalopods with consequences for hatchling
   characteristics. The primary objective of this study was to investigate
   the effect of temperature (12, 15, 18 and 21 degrees C) on the duration
   of Octopus mimus embryo development and to generate a prediction model.
   The effects of temperature on size and physiological characteristics of
   embryos at stage XV were also studied. A third objective was to
   investigate whether temperature affects the time taken to reach stage XX
   using physiological time, i.e. degree-days (DD). The time taken to reach
   stage XV at 21 degrees C was 24,58 and 75\% shorter than observed in
   eggs maintained at 18,15 and 12 degrees C, respectively. Logarithmic
   models were obtained for the relationship between embryo stage and age,
   demonstrating an inverse relationship between environmental temperature
   and the duration of embryonic development. Embryos maintained at 18 and
   21 degrees C grew faster than those kept at 12 and 15 degrees C,
   although that growth rate was accomplished by an inverse relationship
   between yolk and temperature. The degree-day model suggests that between
   128 and 133 DD should be accumulated when embryos are maintained at 15
   to 21 degrees C. As in other invertebrate species the results on oxygen
   consumption indicate that embryos of O. mimus have a higher sensitivity
   to temperature than adults. The results suggest that the optimum range
   of temperatures for these embryos is around 15 to 18 degrees C. (C) 2012

Abstract = {In order to study the tempo and the mode of spider orb web evolution and
   diversification, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using six genetic
   markers along with a comprehensive taxon sample. The present analyses
   are the first to recover the monophyly of orb-weaving spiders based
   solely on DNA sequence data and an extensive taxon sample. We present
   the first dated orb weaver phylogeny. Our results suggest that orb
   weavers appeared by the Middle Triassic and underwent a rapid
   diversification during the end of the Triassic and Early Jurassic. By
   the second half of the Jurassic, most of the extant orb-weaving families
   and web designs were already present. The processes that may have given
   origin to this diversification of lineages and web architectures are
   discussed. A combination of biotic factors, such as key innovations in
   web design and silk composition, as well as abiotic environmental
   changes, may have played important roles in the diversification of orb
   weavers. Our analyses also show that increased taxon sampling density in
   both ingroups and outgroups greatly improves phylogenetic accuracy even
   when extensive data are missing. This effect is particularly important
   when addition of character data improves gene overlap.},

Abstract = {The preference of the hermit crab, Calcinus californiensis, among six
   species of shells, was tested by two different experiments. The first
   experiment used pair-wise trials, analyzing the preference by Chi-square
   tests using two different constructions of the null hypothesis. One
   hypothesis was based on a no-preference among shell species, the second
   on comparing the number of crabs changing for a particular shell species
   when two options were given versus the changing when no options were
   offered. The second experiment was a multiple-alternative test based on
   a rank ordering of the shell preference. This method has both
   statistical and resource-saving advantages over the traditional
   pair-wise comparisons. The sequence of shell preference was similarly
   independent of the procedure used. The preferred shell species are heavy
   and might be associated with hydrodynamic advantages and with the
   protection against predation. The shell preference matches with the
   pattern of shell occupancy indicating that the shell use in nature is
   determined by the crab's preference. The information generated may be
   used for further research on shell preference as a methodological
   alternative.},

Title = {Theoretical Analysis of the Effect of Surface Defects on Porphyrin
   Adsorption and Self-Assembly on Graphite},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) observations of porphyrin
   submonolayers deposited onto highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)
   repeatedly detected the formation of self-assembled porphyrin ribbons.
   An important observation was that these nano-sized ribbons were
   frequently found in contact with topological defects in graphite; in
   particular, this was the case of mesotetraphenylporphine (H2TPP), its
   nickel(II) and cobalt(II) complexes, and hemin. These STM results led us
   to suggest that the modification in the electronic structure of HOPG
   caused by the presence of topological (e.g., surface curvature) and
   oxidized defects, might result in the preferential adsorption of
   porphyrin molecules, therefore serving as the starting points or
   nucleation sites for the self-assembled ribbons. In order to support
   this possibility, we performed first-approach theoretical calculations
   with both molecular mechanical (MM + force field) and density functional
   theory (DFT; PWC/DN theoretical level) methods to simulate two different
   kinds of defects on the graphene surface, and analyze their effects on
   the adsorption of H2TPP as a model porphyrin molecule.},

Abstract = {The cyprinodontiform family Goodeidae comprises two biogeographically
   disjunct subfamilies: the viviparous Goodeinae endemic to the Mexican
   Plateau, and the oviparous Empetrichthyinae, known only from relict taxa
   in Nevada and California. Ovarian characteristics of two oviparous
   species of goodeid, Crenichthys baileyi and Empetrichthys latos, studied
   using museum collections, are compared with those of viviparous species
   of goodeids. Both subfamilies have a single, cystovarian ovary. The
   ovary in the viviparous Goodeinae has an internal septum that divides
   the ovarian lumen into two compartments, and it may possess oogonia.
   There is no ovarian septum in the oviparous C. baileyi and E. latos.
   Oogenesis is similar in both subfamilies with regard to the
   proliferation of oogonia, initiation of meiosis, primary growth and
   development of an oocyte during secondary growth in which fluid yolk
   progressively fuses into a single globule. Notably, eggs of C. baileyi
   and E. latos are approximately double the size of those of the
   viviparous Goodeinae in which embryos develop inside the ovarian lumen
   and are nourished, in part, by nutrients transferred from the maternal
   tissues, a mode of embryo development called matrotrophy. Egg envelopes
   of the two subfamilies differ in that those of C. baileyi and E. latos
   have a relatively thick zona pellucida, attachment fibrils or filaments
   that develop between the follicle cells during oogenesis, and a
   micropyle observed only in E. latos. In contrast, viviparous goodeid
   eggs have a relatively thin zona pellucida, but lack adhesive fibrils,
   and a micropyle was not observed. These reproductive characters are
   compared with those of species of the eastern North American Fundulus, a
   representative oviparous cyprinodontiform. One newlyrecognized shared,
   derived character, a single, median ovoid ovary with no obvious external
   evidence of fusion, supports monophyly of the Goodeidae. Differences
   among the goodeid subfamilies and Fundulus are interpreted relative to
   the oviparous versus viviparous modes of reproduction. J. Morphol.,

Abstract = {Sodium caseinate (CasNa) induces differentiation and M-CSF production in
   mouse band granulocytes in vitro; however, it is not yet known if this
   molecule can also induce the proliferation and activation of the
   granulocyte lineage in vivo. In this work we evaluated the induction in
   vivo of granulopoiesis and the activation of granulocytes in mice
   treated with CasNa.
   BALB/c male mice 8-12 weeks old were used.
   The animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 ml of CasNa (10\%
   in PBS p/v) four times (every 48 h).
   Granulocyte proliferation was evaluated by flow cytometry; activation
   was evaluated by phagocytic indices. The cytokine was measured using an
   ELISA assay.
   We show that CasNa increased bone marrow granulopoiesis percentage
   (38.35 +/- A 10.88 vs. 64.94 +/- A 34.14 BrdU+/Gr-1+ cells) and the
   granulocytes generated presented increased phagocytic indices (0.3 +/- A
   0.1 vs. 0.6 +/- A 0.11, p < 0.05). We also show that G-CSF (974 +/- A
   411 vs. 3189 +/- A 350 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and GM-CSF increased in serum,
   but only G-CSF in bone marrow plasma.
   CasNa induces granulopoiesis with functional granulocytes, suggesting
   that this molecule could be an innate immune system activator.},

Title = {Roaring Behavior of Two Syntopic Howler Species (Alouatta caraya and A.

Abstract = {Long-distance calls are loud vocalizations involved in within and
   between group communication in animals. These calls may maintain
   cohesion with group members or communicate the ownership of valuable
   resources such as territory, food, or mates to individuals from other
   groups. In howlers (Alouatta spp.), three nonmutually exclusive
   hypotheses suggest that the ultimate function of roaring (howling)
   behavior is to protect resources from neighboring groups. The space/food
   defense hypothesis maintains that roars are used to gain exclusive
   access to food; the mate defense hypothesis holds that roars ensure
   exclusive access to mates; and the infanticide avoidance hypothesis
   states that the roaring behavior serves to avoid male takeovers and
   infanticide. To test these three hypotheses, we conducted a study on
   black-and-gold howlers (Alouatta caraya) and brown howlers (A. guariba
   clamitans) living in syntopy at El Pialito provincial park in northeast
   Argentina. We recorded 12 mo of data on the roaring behavior of two
   groups of each species, along with data on food availability and diet.
   Although all four groups overlapped extensively in their use of food
   resources during the study period, roars occurred much more frequently
   during interactions between groups of the same species than between
   groups of different species. Roaring frequency was not higher during the
   lean season, when high-quality food was less abundant. Howlers did not
   roar more frequently at home range boundaries, nor were roaring bouts
   spatially associated with valuable feeding resources. Males participated
   in all of the roaring bouts, whereas females participated in only 29\%
   of them. Adults did not roar more frequently when there were unweaned
   infants in the group, as expected if roaring behavior decreases
   infanticide risk. These results provide no support for the food defense
   or infanticide avoidance hypotheses, but support predictions derived
   from the mate defense hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) is one of the most important
   marine species under commercial exploitation in the Gulf of Mexico; for
   this reason, interest in developing its culture is a priority. However,
   larviculture remains as the main bottleneck for massive production. In
   this sense, our objective was to determine the changes of digestive
   enzymes activities using biochemical and electrophoretic techniques
   during 36 days of Common snook larviculture fed with live preys
   (microalgae, rotifers, and Artemia). During larviculture, all digestive
   enzymatic activities were detected with low values since yolk
   absorption, 2 days after hatching (dah) onwards. However, the maximum
   values for alkaline protease (6,500 U mg protein(-1)), trypsin (0.053 mU
   x 10(-3) mg protein(-1)), and Leucine aminopeptidase (1.4 x 10(-3) mU mg
   protein(-1)) were detected at 12 dah; for chymotrypsin at 25 dah (3.8 x
   10(-3) mU mg protein(-1)), for carboxypeptidase A (280 mU mg
   protein(-1)) and lipase at 36 dah (480 U mg protein(-1)), for
   alpha-amylase at 7 dah (1.5 U mg protein(-1)), for acid phosphatases at
   34 dah (5.5 U mg protein(-1)), and finally for alkaline phosphatase at
   25 dah (70 U mg protein(-1)). The alkaline protease zymogram showed two
   active bands, the first (26.3 kDa) at 25 dah onwards, and the second
   (51.6 kDa) at 36 dah. The acid protease zymogram showed two bands (RF =
   0.32 and 0.51, respectively) at 34 dah. The digestive enzymatic ontogeny
   of C. undecimalis is very similar to other strictly marine carnivorous
   fish, and we suggest that weaning process should be started at 34 dah.},

Title = {Ruderality in extreme-desert cacti? Population effects of chronic

Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-346},

Abstract = {Ruderal species, i.e., those that increase their numbers in the presence
   of disturbance, are not expected to occur in extreme environments. We
   test whether Echinocereus lindsayi, a cactus from an extreme desert,
   follows the ruderal trend observed in similar species from mild deserts,
   or, as theory suggests, it is a non ruderal. Contrary to expectations,
   its density and fraction of small individuals in the population
   increased with disturbance. This seemingly results from increased
   establishment, as it is nursed by rocks exposed by disturbance. A
   demographic model for two populations, one nearly pristine and another
   highly disturbed, showed that at the latter site recruitment was more
   frequent and likely. At the disturbed site the performance of E.
   lindsayi individuals was usually poor, except on favorable years. Then,
   competition release caused by disturbance apparently allowed for a
   better performance compared to the less disturbed site. Despite that
   this opportunistic behavior would suffice to maintain the population
   size stable, the large mortality produced by an insect outbreak in two
   of the four study years caused the population to diminish. In contrast,
   the population at the less disturbed site was near equilibrium. If the
   insect outbreak is associated to disturbance, E. lindsayi at the
   disturbed site would be already experiencing more disturbance than it
   tolerates. This agrees with the fact that no populations were found at
   greater disturbance intensities. While, contrary to our hypothesis, E.
   lindsayi is ruderal, this extreme desert species appears to tolerate far
   less disturbance than its counterparts from milder areas.},

Abstract = {We measured mobility patterns that describe walking trajectories of
   individual Me'Phaa peasants searching for and collecting fuel wood in
   the forests of ``La Montaa de Guerrero{''} in Mexico. These 1-day
   excursions typically follow a mixed pattern of nearly-constant steps
   when individuals displace from their homes towards potential collecting
   sites and a mixed pattern of steps of different lengths when actually
   searching for fallen wood in the forest. Displacements in the searching
   phase seem not to be compatible with L,vy flights described by
   power-laws with optimal scaling exponents. These findings, however, can
   be interpreted in the light of deterministic searching on heavily
   degraded landscapes where the interaction of the individuals with their
   fuel wood-scarce environment produces alternative searching strategies
   than the expected L,vy flights. These results have important
   implications for future management and restoration of degraded forests
   and the improvement of the ecological services they may provide to their
   inhabitants.},

   cyanobacteria, 1 Xanthophyta, 25 Chlorophyta, 1 Ochrophyta-Phaeophyceae,
   19 Rhodophyta, and 1 Anthophyta. Species richness varied between
   habitats; pneumatophores supported 29 species of algae, aerial roots
   supported 20 species of algae, and the channel bottom supported 46
   species. Taxa common to the three habitats were Lyngbya sp., Vaucheria
   sp., Boodleopsis pusilla, Rhizoclonium riparium, and Bostrychia
   radicans. Mean wet weight algal biomasses on aerial roots and in the
   channel were 494 g root(-1) and 12,924 g m(-2), respectively. The
   dominant species on aerial roots and on the channel bottom were Caulerpa
   sertularioides, Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis, and Spyridia filamentosa.
   The channel bottom also had Vaucheria sp. and two cyanobacteria
   (Oscillatoria sp. and Lyngbya sp.). Morphotypes of two cyanobacteria
   (Heteroleibleinia sp. and Johanesbaptistia sp.) are recorded in this
   habitat for the first time.},

   doi:10.1152/ajplung.00319.2011.-Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a
   complex disease with poorly understood etiology. Previously, we reported
   upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) in both lung and
   peripheral blood of IPF patients. Here we report evidence for genetic
   correlation of plasma levels and promoter polymorphisms (rs11568818 and
   rs11568819) of MMP7 in a well-characterized IPF cohort. Both the AA
   genotype of rs11568818 and the CT genotype of rs11568819 were found to
   be significantly associated with higher MMP7 plasma levels. These
   associations were observed only in IPF patients and not in healthy
   controls. The G-to-A transition of rs11568818 resulted in a novel
   binding site for the forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) transcription factor, a key
   regulator of embryonic lung development and proper function of the
   mature lung. In vitro, this transition led to increased sensitivity of
   the MMP7 promoter to FOXA2. In IPF lungs, FOXA2 was localized in the
   nucleus of epithelial cells that expressed MMP7 in the cytoplasm. These
   results suggest that increased sensitivity of the polymorphic MMP7
   promoter to FOXA2 provides one of the genetic bases for the upregulation
   of MMP7 in IPF.},

   Cacti},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Succulent cacti are remarkable plants with capabilities to withstand
   long periods of drought. However, their adult success is contingent on
   the early seedling stages, when plants are highly susceptible to the
   environment. To better understand their early coping strategies in a
   challenging environment, two developmental aspects (anatomy and
   morphology) in Polaskia chichipe and Echinocactus platyacanthus were
   studied in the context of developmental reaction norms under drought
   conditions. The morphology was evaluated using landmark based
   morphometrics and Principal Component Analysis, which gave three main
   trends of the variation in each species. The anatomy was quantified as
   number and area of xylem vessels. The quantitative relationship between
   morphology and anatomy in early stages of development, as a response to
   drought was revealed in these two species. Qualitatively, collapsible
   cells and collapsible parenchyma tissue were observed in seedlings of
   both species, more often in those subjected to water stress. These
   tissues were located inside the epidermis, resembling a web of
   collapsible-cell groups surrounding turgid cells, vascular bundles, and
   spanned across the pith. Occasionally the groups formed a continuum
   stretching from the epidermis towards the vasculature. Integrating the
   morphology and the anatomy in a developmental context as a response to
   environmental conditions provides a better understanding of the
   organism's dynamics, adaptation, and plasticity.},

Title = {Pattern formation from consistent dynamical closures of uniaxial nematic
   liquid crystals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {136},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Pattern formation in uniaxial polymeric liquid crystals is studied for
   different dynamic closure approximations. Using the principles of
   mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics in a mean-field approach, we
   derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the single-particle non-homogeneous
   distribution function of particle orientations and the evolution
   equations for the second and fourth order orientational tensor
   parameters. Afterwards, two dynamic closure approximations are
   discussed, one of them considering the relaxation of the fourth order
   orientational parameter and leading to a novel expression for the
   free-energy like function in terms of the scalar order parameter.
   Considering the evolution equation of the density of the system and
   values of the interaction parameter for which isotropic and nematic
   phases coexist, our analysis predicts that patterns and traveling waves
   can be produced in lyotropic uniaxial nematics even in the absence of
   external driving. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {First-principles theoretical investigation of monoatomic and dimer Mn
   adsorption on noble metal (111) surfaces},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {A theoretical investigation of the adsorption of Mn single atoms and
   dimers on the (111) surface of Cu, Ag, and Au, within the framework of
   the density functional theory, is presented. First, the bulk and the
   clean (111) surface electronic structures are calculated, with results
   that agree well with previous reports. To understand the
   adatom-substrate interaction, also the electronic characteristics of the
   free Mn dimer are determined. Then, the electronic structure of the Mn
   adatom, chemisorbed on four different surface geometries, is analyzed
   for the three noble metals. It is found that the most stable geometry,
   in all three cases, Cu, Ag, and Au, occurs when the Mn atom is
   chemisorbed on threefold coordinated sites. For the dimer, the
   lowest-energy configuration corresponds to the molecule lying parallel
   to the surface. In the three noble metals, the geometry corresponds to
   both atoms chemisorbed in threefold coordinated sites, but with
   different local symmetry. It is also found that the magnetic
   configuration with the lowest energy corresponds to the
   antiferromagnetic arrangement of Mn atoms, with individual magnetic
   moments close to 5 mu(B). The ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
   solutions, in the case of a Ag substrate, are close in energy. It is
   also found that in this case the Mn-2 molecule is chemisorbed with very
   similar energy on various geometries. To study the dynamical motion of
   the dimer components, we calculated the potential energy barriers for
   the Mn motion in the various surfaces. In contrast to Cu and Au, this
   leads to the conclusion that on Ag the Mn dimer moves relatively freely.},

Abstract = {Laser microfabrication is now offering interesting solutions to rapidly
   produce high-resolution photomasks or microstructures. However, most
   works require expensive commercial lasers and computer numerical control
   platforms, limiting its use by a large public. In this paper, we report
   the construction of a simple, custom-made, easily reproducible,
   automated laser system, based on a DVD optical pickup head. A
   user-friendly computer interface specifically designed to operate a
   motorized three-axis platform with micrometric precision controls focus
   distance and in-plane displacements. Writing performance
   characterization for both direct ablation and sintering of commercial
   black toner demonstrated flexibility in tridimensional microfabrication

Abstract = {We establish the existence of universal G-spaces for proper actions of
   locally compact groups on Tychonoff spaces. A typical result sounds as
   follows: for each infinite cardinal number tau every locally compact,
   non-compact, sigma-compact group G of weight w(G) <= tau can act
   properly on R-tau \textbackslash{} \{0\} such that R-tau
   \textbackslash{} \{0\} contains a G-homeomorphic copy of every Tychonoff
   proper G-space of weight <= tau. The metric cones Cone(G/H) with H
   subset of G a compact subgroup such that G/H is a manifold, are the main
   building blocks in our approach. As a byproduct we prove that the
   cardinality of the set of all conjugacy classes of such subgroups H
   subset of G does not exceed the weight of G. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Speciation in an avian complex endemic to the mountains of Middle

Volume = {62},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The implementation of the phylogeographic approach for the study of
   biodiversity is critical in poorly sampled regions like the montane
   systems of Middle America, as complex evolutionary histories often
   result in the presence of independent lineages not properly considered
   by traditional taxonomy. Herein we sequenced 2370 bp of mtDNA (ND2, cyt
   b and ATPase) from 81 individuals of Ergaticus, a complex of birds
   endemic to the montane forests of Middle America. Although current
   taxonomy recognizes two species, the results reveal considerable genetic
   structure with the presence of four mtDNA lineages. Two of these
   lineages within Ergaticus ruber evidence the need of a revaluation of
   the species limits for this taxon. The general phylogeographic pattern
   can be explained as a consequence of relative isolation of the
   populations in different mountain ranges separated by low elevation
   barriers. Most population groups did not show signals of demographic
   expansion with the exception of the one corresponding to clade 1. The
   divergence time estimates point to the Pleistocene as an important time
   period for the diversification of this complex. (C) 201 1 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {We present a comparison at the generic level of the cave Collembola
   fauna recorded around the world. Using the biogeographical provinces
   proposed by Christiansen and Bellinger (1995), we analyzed the
   similarity among regions according to the Collembola genera inhabiting
   caves. The European region is separated from the remaining
   biogeographical regions, and one of the main groups includes the Asia
   Pacific region, North America, and the Arctic and Subarctic regions.
   This can be related to the differences in the distribution of the
   genera, and the wide distribution of some of them in the world. Some
   provinces share the same Collembola in spite of their great geographic
   distances, perhaps resulting from their geological origin or from the
   different collecting efforts in each region.},

Abstract = {The Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TVB) is recognized as a center of
   diversification, endemism and biogeographic transition. Due to its
   environmental heterogeneity, complex geological origin and intricate
   distributional patterns, there is no consensus on its geographic
   delimitation and the ecological and biogeographic differentiation of its
   biota. We undertook a spatial analysis of the geology, altitude, climate
   and vegetation types, and the richness and endemicity patterns
   associated, with the aim of characterizing the province and the units
   within it. We also analyzed the distributional patterns of the mammal
   fauna, based on ecological niche models of the species. The TVB is
   characterized as a biogeographic unit, with 2 districts (east and west),
   where vegetation and altitude explain the distribution of richness and
   endemism of the mammal fauna, and the pine-oak forest from 2 000 to 3
   000 m is the most relevant portion. The highest species richness is
   found in orders Rodentia and Chiroptera; 12 out of the 13 mammal genera
   endemic to Mexico are represented in the TVB, and 14 endemic species are
   registered for the province, mostly rodents.},

Abstract = {Objective: Nursing personnel applied a computerized evaluation
   instrument, Neuropediatric Development (NPED), and compared the
   prevalence of deviations from normal neurodevelopment in four
   communities of two Latin American countries, Mexico and Cuba. At the
   same time the feasibility of introducing this tool into Mexican local
   health centers was assessed. Design and Sample: The NPED screening tool
   was applied to 400 children 1-60 months old from two suburban and one
   urban communities of Mexico and one urban community of Cuba. Measures:
   The NPED instrument was developed at the Neurosciences Centre of Cuba
   (Santos, \& Perez-Abalo, 2011; Santos, Perez-Abalo, \& Alvarez, 2007),
   and explores three neurodevelopmental areas: language/communication,
   psychomotor, and sensory maturation (hearing/vision). Results: Global
   (21.5\%), language (16.5\%), psychomotor (5.8\%), and sensory
   (vision/audition; 2.3\%/7\%) failures were observed. Among Mexican
   communities, apart from the hearing test in which the urban community
   showed a significantly higher percentage of failures (p <.001), there
   were no other significant differences. When compared, the Cuban
   community showed a significantly higher proportion of audition failures
   in relation to the Mexican communities. Conclusions: The prevalence of
   deviations from normal neurodevelopment was highly similar between both
   countries, and the NPED system fulfils the necessary requisites for mass
   screening to be applied by nursing staff at a primary care level.},

Abstract = {The pulsatile secretion of hormones from the mammalian pituitary gland
   drives a wide range of homeostatic responses by dynamically altering the
   functional set-point of effector tissues. To accomplish this, endocrine
   cell populations residing within the intact pituitary display
   large-scale changes in coordinated calcium-spiking activity in response
   to various hypothalamic and peripheral inputs. Although the pituitary
   gland is structurally compartmentalized into specific and intermingled
   endocrine cell networks, providing a clear morphological basis for such
   coordinated activity, the mechanisms which facilitate the timely
   propagation of information between cells in situ remain largely
   unexplored. Therefore, the aim of the current review is to highlight the
   range of signalling modalities known to be employed by endocrine cells
   to coordinate intracellular calcium rises, and discuss how these
   mechanisms are integrated at the population level to orchestrate cell
   function and tissue output. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessment of Water Supply as an Ecosystem Service in a Rural-Urban
   Watershed in Southwestern Mexico City},

Abstract = {Studies from the ecosystem services perspective can provide a useful
   framework because they allow us to fully examine the benefits that
   humans obtain from socio-ecological systems. Mexico City, the second
   largest city in the world, has faced severe problems related to water
   shortages, which have worsened due to increasing population. Demand for
   space has forced changes in land cover, including covering areas that
   are essential for groundwater recharge. The city has 880 km(2) of forest
   areas that are crucial for the water supply. The Magdalena River
   Watershed was chosen as a model because it is a well-preserved zone
   within Mexico City and it provides water for the population. The general
   aim of this study was to assess the ecosystem service of the water
   supply in the Magdalena River Watershed by determining its water balance
   (SWAT model) and the number of beneficiaries of the ecosystem services.
   The results showed that the watershed provides 18.4 hm(3) of water per
   year. Baseflow was dominant, with a contribution of 85\%, while surface
   runoff only accounted for 15\%. The zone provides drinking water to
   78,476 inhabitants and could supply 153,203 potential beneficiaries.
   This work provides an example for understanding how ecosystem processes
   determine the provision of ecosystem services and benefits to the
   population in a rural-urban watershed in Mexico City.},

Abstract = {Distributional patterns of Valeriana species from southern South America

   track analysis and a parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), the latter
   with 134 grid cells of 1.5 degrees latitude by 1.5 degrees longitude.
   Three generalized tracks and one node were obtained, and three areas of
   endemism were identified. These general patterns of distribution in
   Valeriana were used to infer possible vicariance and dispersal events
   that might have shaped them. We identified a center of diversification
   in Central Chile and the Argentinean province of Neuquen. It represents
   a complex area that is related to both the Central Chilean and
   Subantarctic subregions.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the relationship between the spatial structures of
   environmental variables and of the associated seedling and sapling
   communities is crucial to understanding the regeneration processes in
   forest communities. The degree of spatial structuring (i.e., spatial
   autocorrelation) of environmental and sapling community variables in the
   cloud forest of Teipan, S Mexico, were analyzed at a 1-ha scale using
   geostatistical analysis; after fitting semivariogram models for each set
   of variables, the association between the two sets was examined through
   cross-variograms. Kriging maps of the sapling community variables
   (density, cover, species richness, and mortality and recruitment rates)
   were obtained through conditional simulation method. Canopy openness,
   total solar radiation, litter depth, soil temperature and soil moisture
   were spatially structured, as were sapling density, species richness and
   sapling mortality rate. Mean range in semivariograms for environmental
   and sapling community variables were 13.14 +/- 3.67 and 12.68 +/- 5.71 m
   (+/- SE), respectively. The spatial structure of litter depth was
   negatively associated with the spatial structures of sapling density,
   species richness, and sapling community cover; in turn, the spatial
   structure of soil moisture was positively associated with the spatial
   structure of recruitment rate. These associations of the spatial
   structures of abiotic and sapling community variables suggest that the
   regeneration processes in this cloud forest is driven by the existence
   of different microsites, largely characterized by litter depth
   variations, across which saplings of tree species encounter a range of
   opportunities for successful establishment and survival.},

Abstract = {Silica-carbonate biomorphs are inorganic self-organized structures that
   mimic the morphology of living organisms. In this study, we present the
   effect that proteins involved in the in vivo biomineralization of silica
   and calcium carbonate have on the formation of silica-carbonate
   biomorphs. We tested four different sources of protein: (1)
   struthiocalcin-1, (2) the catalytic domain of silicatein-alpha of Tethya
   aurantia, (3) a protein extract obtained from the spicules of a vitreous
   sponge (Protosuberitis sp.), and (4) a protein extract obtained from the
   spines of the sea urchin Echinometra lucunter. In addition to the
   well-established role that pH plays in biomorph formation, all the
   proteins tested controlled the morphology of these aggregates. Biomorphs
   obtained in the presence of the catalytic domain of silicatein-alpha
   were similar in shape to those observed in the control though
   considerably smaller in size. Struthiocalcin-1 affected the availability
   of carbonate ions and completely inhibited the formation of biomorphs
   resulting only in worm-like aggregates. Finally, novel biomorphs with
   shapes such as twisting rods, sunflowers, and mitotic cells were
   obtained in the presence of protein extracts from the marine sponge
   spicules and sea urchin spines.},

Abstract = {Virus-like particles (VLPs) are biological nanoparticles identical to
   the natural virions, but without genetic material. VLPs are suitable for
   the analysis of viral infection mechanisms, vaccine production,
   tissue-specific drug delivery, and as biological nanomaterials. Human
   parvovirus B19 (B19) infects humans; therefore VLPs derived from this
   virus have enormous potential in medicine and diagnostics. Current
   production of self-assembled VLPs derived from B19 is typically carried
   out in eukaryotic expression systems. However many applications of VLPs
   require access to its internal core. Consequently, the processes of
   disassembly and further reassembly of VLPs are critical both for
   purification of viral proteins, and for encapsulation purposes. Herein
   we report the in vitro self-assembly of B19 VLPs derived from the
   recombinant VP2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and the effects of
   pH and ionic strength on the assembly process. Our results demonstrate
   that VP2 is able to form VLPs completely in vitro. At neutral pH,
   homogeneous VLPs assemble, while at acidic and basic pHs, with low ionic
   strength, the major assemblies are small intermediates. The in vitro
   self-assembled VLPs are highly stable at 37 degrees C, and a significant
   fraction of particles remain assembled after 30 min at 80 degrees C. (C)

Abstract = {The A/H1N1 influenza strain isolated in Mexico in 2009 caused severe
   pulmonary illness in a small number of exposed individuals. Our
   objective was to determine the influence of genetic factors on their
   susceptibility.
   We carried out a case-control association study genotyping 91 patients
   with confirmed severe pneumonia from A/H1N1 infection and 98 exposed but
   asymptomatic household contacts, using the HumanCVD BeadChip (Illumina,
   San Diego, CA, USA).
   Four risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly (p <
   0.0001) associated with severe pneumonia: rs1801274 (Fc fragment of
   immunoglobulin G, low-affinity IIA, receptor (FCGR2A) gene, chromosome
   1; OR 2.68, 95\% CI 1.69-4.25); rs9856661 (gene unknown, chromosome 3;
   OR 2.62, 95\% CI 1.64-4.18); rs8070740 (RPA interacting protein (RPAIN)
   gene, chromosome 17; OR 2.67, 95\% CI 1.63-4.39); and rs3786054
   (complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP) gene,
   chromosome 17; OR 3.13, 95\% CI 1.89-5.17). All SNP associations
   remained significant after adjustment for sex and comorbidities. The
   SNPs on chromosome 17 were in linkage disequilibrium.
   These findings revealed that gene polymorphisms located in chromosomes 1
   and 17 might influence susceptibility to development of severe pneumonia
   in A/H1N1 infection. Two of these SNPs are mapped within genes (FCGR2A,
   C1QBP) involved in the handling of immune complexes and complement
   activation, respectively, suggesting that these genes may confer risk
   due to increased activation of host immunity.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-service provision will
   increasingly depend on the existence of secondary vegetation. Our
   success in achieving these goals will be determined by our ability to
   accurately estimate the structure and diversity of such communities at
   broad geographic scales. We examined whether the texture (the spatial
   variation of the image elements) of very high-resolution satellite
   imagery can be used for this purpose. In 14 fallows of different ages
   and one mature forest stand in a seasonally dry tropical forest
   landscape, we estimated basal area, canopy cover, stem density, species
   richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, and canopy height. The first six
   attributes were also estimated for a subset comprising the tallest
   plants. We calculated 40 texture variables based on the red and the near
   infrared bands, and EVI and NDVI, and selected the best-fit linear
   models describing each vegetation attribute based on them. Basal area
   (R-2 = 0.93), vegetation height and cover (0.89), species richness
   (0.87), and stand age (0.85) were the best-described attributes by
   two-variable models. Cross validation showed that these models had a
   high predictive power, and most estimated vegetation attributes were
   highly accurate. The success of this simple method (a single image was
   used and the models were linear and included very few variables) rests
   on the principle that image texture reflects the internal heterogeneity
   of successional vegetation at the proper scale. The vegetation
   attributes best predicted by texture are relevant in the face of two of
   the gravest threats to biosphere integrity: climate change and
   biodiversity loss. By providing reliable basal area and fallow-age
   estimates, image-texture analysis allows for the assessment of carbon
   sequestration and diversity loss rates. New and exciting research
   avenues open by simplifying the analysis of the extent and complexity of
   successional vegetation through the spatial variation of its spectral
   information.},

Title = {Host selection by the cleaner shrimp Ancylomenes pedersoni: Do
   anemone host species, prior experience or the presence of conspecific
   shrimp matter?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},

Volume = {413},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {In the symbiotic association that exists between cleaner shrimp
   Ancylomenes pedersoni (=Periclimenes pedersoni) and host sea anemones,
   specificity varies among populations, and shrimp are believed to search
   among different individual hosts for favourable positions from which to
   attract client fish. Four laboratory-based experiments were conducted to
   test host selection of A. pedersoni between the following: i)
   Bartholomea annulata (corkscrew anemone) and Condylactis gigantea (condy
   anemone), ii) B. annulata, with or without a conspecific resident, iii)
   a previously known or unknown B. annulata, and iv) a previously known or
   unknown C gigantea. Preference (active selection) was distinguished from
   mere passive association by comparing shrimp acclimation to anemones
   offered in choice and no-choice (control) situations. The results were
   analysed using asymmetrical chi(2) contingency tables (in each
   experiment, n=60) where expected frequencies were obtained with maximum
   likelihood estimators. Shrimp acclimated more frequently to B. annulata
   than to C. gigantea, but they acclimated similarly to anemones with or
   without another resident and to those B. annulata and C gigantea
   anemones that were familiar rather than unfamiliar. However, none of the
   chi(2) values were statistically significant (chi(2)(df=1)=0.48, 0.19,
   0.42, 0.42; overall p>0.45). suggesting that preference may not be
   responsible for the association between adult A. pedersoni and its host
   anemones observed in the field. Differences in the frequency of
   association may be due to factors other than the active decisions made
   by shrimp when presented with more than one alternative host. (C) 2011

Title = {SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN TRYPSIN AND α-AMYLASE ACTIVITIES CAUSED BY THE

Abstract = {In view of the relationship between shifts in diet composition and the
   activity of digestive enzymes in penaeid shrimp, the present study
   focused on the analysis of digestive trypsin and a-amylase activities of
   wild Farfantepenaeus. duorarum (Burkenroad, 1939) juveniles and their
   changes in phenotypic expression, during the molt cycle as endogenous
   factor and their changes due to different feeding regimes (exogenous
   factor) in relation with delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signature as
   an index of food assimilation induced by the seasonal availability of
   food items in the nursery area. Wild juveniles of F. duorarum were
   captured from April 2007 to February 2008, in the Celestun coastal
   lagoon, Yucatan, Mexico. Samplings were carried out considering all
   quarters of the lunar cycle and in each of the recognized seasons for
   this region: dry, rainy, and the Nortes (North Wind). Copepods and
   amphipods were the main source of food for juveniles of E duorarum.
   Values of delta C-13 in the muscular tissue were near -20 parts per
   thousand hence the feeding regime of F. duorarum in the lagoon was
   composed by material of marine origin. Isotopic signature differences
   were found between the three annual seasons. It is an opportunist
   generalist organism that is located in the 4(th) trophic level. The
   digestive enzymatic activities of both trypsin and alpha-amylase in
   fresh hepatopancreas tissue showed an interaction between season and
   molt stages (p < 0.05). Activity of the trypsin was highest during the
   Nortes at molt stage C (140 mU mg(-1) HP) and activity of a-amylase was
   higher in the Nortes at stage B-2 (674 mU mg(-1) HP). The
   amylase/trypsin ratio also showed significant interaction between season
   and molt stages (p < 0.05), with higher values in premolt stages during
   the rainy and Nortes seasons. Isoforms of these digestive enzymes
   differed in expression according to the molt stage and also to the
   season with expression generally being greater at stage C.},

Abstract = {A kernel of a directed graph is a set of vertices which is both
   independent and absorbent. And a digraph is said to be kernel perfect if
   and only if any induced subdigraph has a kernel. Given a set of arcs F,
   a semikernel S modulo F is an independent set such that if some Sz-arc
   is not in F, then there exists a zS-arc. A sufficient condition on the
   digraph is given in terms of semikernel modulo F in order to guarantee
   that a digraph is kernel perfect. To do that we give a characterization
   of kernel perfectness which is a generalization of a previous result
   given by Neumann-Lara {[}SeminA(0)cleos de una digrafica. Anales del
   Instituto de Matematicas 2, Universidad Nacional Autnoma de M,xico,
   1971]. And moreover, we show by means of an example that our result is
   independent of previous known sufficient conditions.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether circadian locomotor
   activity, and the daily profile of plasma parameters related to
   metabolic syndrome (nutrients: glucose and triacylglycerides, and
   hormones: insulin and leptin), differ between male and female Neotomodon
   alstoni mice, both lean and obese. Young adult animals were captured in
   the field and kept at the laboratory animal facility. After 6 to 7
   months feeding the animals ad libitum with a regular diet for laboratory
   rodents, 50-60\% of mice became obese. Comparisons between sexes
   indicated that lean females were more active than males; however obese
   females reduced their nocturnal activity either in LD or DD, and
   advanced the phase of their activity-onset with respect to lights off.
   No differences in food intake between lean and obese mice, either during
   the day or night, were observed. Daily profiles of metabolic
   syndrome-related plasma parameters showed differences between sexes, and
   obesity was associated with increased values, especially leptin (500\%
   in females and 273\% in males) and insulin (150\% in both females and
   males), as compared with lean mice. Our results indicate that lean mice
   display behavioral and endocrine differences between sexes, and obesity
   affects the parameters tested in a sex-dependent manner. The
   aforementioned leads us to propose N. alstoni, studied in captivity,
   could be an interesting model for the study of sex differences in the
   effects of obesity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The primary and secondary structures of the intergenic spacer (IGS)
   between the 3'-end of 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the 5'-end of
   18S rRNA gene are described for the cultivated chili pepper Capsicum
   pubescens. The recognized functional IGS is 2,078 bp in length.
   According to nucleotide base composition, regulatory elements, and
   conserved and repeated sequences the IGS can be divided into seven
   structural regions (SRI-VII). SRI comprises three copies of
   GAGGTTTTT-like motif, a probable transcription termination site in
   Solanaceae. At 3'-end, there are 21 bp matching the 18S rDNA. SRII is
   formed by 47 repeats of CACCATGG-like motif, the shortest repetitive
   region found in plant rDNA to date. SRIII is highly AT-rich, preceding
   SRIV, a highly conserved region in Solanaceae containing the
   transcription initiation site (TIS) TATA-TAAGGGGGG. The external
   transcribed spacer (ETS) is 966 bp in length. SRV-VII, downstream of the
   TIS, possesses eight inverted repeats, and three predicted stem-loops
   show pre-micro RNA (miRNA)-like structural features. Intragenomic
   variation is presented, and data are compared with characterized
   Solanaceae 25S-18S rDNA IGS.},

Title = {Conostegia xalapensis (Melastomataceae): an aluminum accumulator plant},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {144},
Number = {2},
Pages = {134-145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In acidic soils, an excess of Al3+ is toxic to most plants. The
   Melastomataceae family includes Al-accumulator genera that tolerate high
   Al3+ by accumulating it in their tissues. Conostegia xalapensis is a
   common shrub in Mexico and Central America colonizing mainly disturbed
   areas. Here, we determined whether C. xalapensis is an Al accumulator,
   and whether it has internal tolerance mechanisms to Al. Soil samples
   collected from two pastures in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, had low pH
   and high Al3+ concentrations along with low Ca2+ levels. Leaves of C.
   xalapensis from pastures showed up to 19 000 mg Al kg-1 DW (dry weight).
   In laboratory experiments, 8-month-old seedlings treated with 0.5 and
   1.0 mM AlCl3 for 24 days showed higher number of lateral roots and
   biomass. Pyrocatechol violet and hematoxylin staining evidenced that Al
   localized in epidermis and mesophyll cells in leaves and in epidermis
   and vascular pith in roots. Scanning electron microscope-energy
   dispersive X-ray microanalysis of Al-treated leaves corroborated that Al
   is in abaxial and adaxial epidermis and in mesophyll cells (31.2\%) in
   1.0 mM Al-treatment. Roots of Al-treated plants had glutathione
   reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) activity
   higher, and low levels of O and H 2O2. C. xalapensis is an
   Al-accumulator plant that can grow in acidic soils with higher Al3+
   concentrations, and can be considered as an indicator species for soils
   with potential Al toxicity.},

Title = {ASSESSING MIGRATORY DOUBLE BREEDING THROUGH COMPLEMENTARY SPECIMEN
   DENSITIES AND BREEDING RECORDS},
Journal = {CONDOR},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {114},

Abstract = {We re-evaluate the plausibility that five species of birds that breed in
   late summer in northwestern Mexico are migratory double breeders that
   first bred earlier in the same season to the north. We use data
   aggregated from scientific collections to generate abundance indices
   that adjust counts of specimens in collections by collecting effort,
   which we measure as the number of passerines collected in the same
   region and time period as the species of interest. Our abundance indices
   generally show displaced phenologies, such that presumed double breeders
   arrive and breed early in the north, then later in northwestern Mexico.
   We also compare breeding records for these regions, but these records
   could not be corrected for effort. Our phenologies suggest that the
   breeding populations of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus)
   from the western U.S. and northwestern Mexico may be derived from birds
   that bred earlier in eastern North America. Similarly, Orchard Orioles
   (Icterus spurius) breeding in late summer in northwestern Mexico and on
   the Mexican plateau may be derived from birds that attempted to breed
   earlier in North America. Our abundance indices and other new data
   suggest migratory double breeding is less likely in the Hooded Oriole
   (I. cucullatus) and probably not occurring in the Yellow-breasted Chat
   (Icteria virens) and Cassin's Vireo (Vireo cassinii).},

Title = {Computational alternatives to generate amorphous nanoporous structures

Year = {2012},
Volume = {358},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {We present two approaches to generate amorphous nanoporous structures
   based on the geometrical handling of crystalline supercells and ab
   initio molecular dynamics. The first approach has been partially
   reported previously and consists in expanding a crystalline supercell
   (the expanding lattice approach) by lengthening the edges
   (proportionally increasing the interatomic distance) to obtain the
   desired porosity (density). Then, molecular dynamics is applied at
   diverse constant temperatures to allow the atoms to rearrange and create
   the corresponding atomic topology. The other one, inspired by the
   experimental process called dealloying is similar to that process which
   is used to generate porous metals by etching away one or several of the
   elements of an alloy. Both processes are applied to semiconducting
   (carbon, silicon) and metallic (copper, silver) materials and the
   results compared. Pair distribution functions are obtained in order to
   show that although both techniques may be similar, the dealloying
   technique seems to be more adequate when dealing with alloy systems. An
   interesting byproduct is that pair distribution functions tend to values
   lower that 1 for intermediate-to-long range distances in a region
   commensurate with the pore size. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Exploring the phenotypic plasticity of standard metabolic rate and its
   inter-individual consistency in the hermit crab Calcinus
   californiensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {412},
Pages = {20-26},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {The standard metabolic rate (SMR) is a central aspect in bioenergetics
   closely related to fitness, where consistent differences in the SMR may
   account for differences in an individual's performance. The SMR can be a
   plastic trait, where the metabolic depression can be advantageous under
   unfavourable conditions. The SMR of the hermit crab Calcinus
   californiensis occupying intact and broken shells in the wild were
   compared. Subsequently, a shell-swapping experiment and repeated
   measures test of the SMR of crabs occupying both types of shells were
   made to test if differences in the SMR were a consequence of the shell
   occupied (plasticity) or a result of an intrinsic variation between
   individuals (consistency). Crabs occupying broken shells had a lower
   metabolism than those in intact shells. The gradual recovery of the SMR
   of the crabs swapped to broken shells to similar metabolic levels of
   those of crabs tested in intact shells suggests that though the use of a
   broken shell can be disadvantageous in the wild, broken shells might
   produce a more benign situation under laboratory conditions. The
   depression of the SMR may act as an adaptive response to cope with the
   disadvantages caused by broken shells in a challenging environment. The
   SMR showed individual consistency, suggesting that it may play an
   important role as an adaptive trait. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Effect of Opuntia streptacantha Lem. on alpha-glucosidase
   activity},

Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: In Mexico, Opuntia streptacantha is used
   as part of a traditional medicine in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
   Several studies have reported an anti-hyperglycemic effect from the
   plant, but none have focused on finding a mechanism of action to explain
   these results. This paper focuses on one of the most recurrent
   hypotheses for the effect of O. streptacantha: the mechanism of action
   is the hydrolysis of disaccharides, either by enzymatically inhibiting
   the alpha glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) or mechanically acting as a
   barrier.
   Materials and methods: To test our hypothesis, three different
   experiments were performed. A maltose tolerance test was carried out
   using the total extract (TE) and the juice of the plant. Six different
   extracts were tested in a free-enzyme assay, four of which were aqueous
   extracts varying according to the procedure of removing the insoluble
   particles in an attempt to reduce the loss of the water-soluble
   compounds. The main component of the total extract, a derivative of
   (4-hydroxy)-phenyl acetic acid, was also tested. For both the maltose
   tolerance test and the free-enzyme assay, acarbose was used as a control
   drug. Finally, an everted small intestine assay was also performed.
   Results and conclusions: The maltose tolerance test confirmed that an
   anti-hyperglycemic effect occurs at doses of 100 mg/kg TE and 4 mL/kg
   juice. No inhibition on AGIs was observed in the free-enzyme assay, and
   neither a mechanic nor enzymatic effect on disaccharide hydrolysis was
   observed in the everted intestine assay.
   Conclusions: The anti-hyperglycemic effect of O. streptacantha was
   confirmed, and the results presented here contribute to the
   understanding that this effect is not due to the action on
   alpha-glucosidases or related to the intestinal hydrolysis of
   disaccharides. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Consider a set of mobile clients represented by n points in the plane
   moving at constant speed along n different straight lines. We study the
   problem of covering all mobile clients using a set of k disks centered
   at k fixed centers. Each disk exists only at one instant and while it
   does, covers any client within its coverage radius. The task is to
   select an activation time and a radius for each disk such that every
   mobile client is covered by at least one disk. In particular, we study
   the optimization problem of minimizing the maximum coverage radius.
   First we prove that, although the static version of the problem is
   polynomial, the kinetic version is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that the
   problem is not approximable by a constant factor (unless P = NP). We
   then present a generic framework to solve it for fixed values of k,
   which in turn allows us to solve more general optimization problems. Our
   algorithms are efficient for constant values of k. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {A new combination Cyclotella marina (Tanimura, Nagumo et Kato)
   Ake-Castillo, Okolodkov et Ector comb. et stat. nov. is proposed for the
   diatom Cyclotella atomus var. marina Tanimura, Nagumo et Kato. This
   taxon is clearly distinguishable from C. atomus Hustedt by its smaller
   diameter and in lacking the valve-face fultoportula. Open chambers seem
   to be a constant character, in contrast to C. atomus var. atomus and
   var. gracilis Genkal et Kiss. It is represented by solitary
   low-cylindrical cells of 4-5 mu m in diameter and 2.3-3.1 mu m along the
   pervalvar axis. This diatom was identified as a causative agent of a
   harmful algal bloom event in late May 2009, in the neritic zone of the
   Yucatan Peninsula, Gulf of Mexico, reaching an abundance of 1.167 x
   10(7) cells/l. In contrast to the freshwater-brackish water preference
   of the nominate variety of C. aromas and the variety gracilis, the taxon
   studied here shows preference for normal marine salinities (>= 30 psu).
   Our morphological observations revealed (1) the possession of two
   chloroplasts, (2) the presence of granules/spinules around the external
   short tubes of the fultoportulae, (3) areolated valvocopulae, and (4)
   the presence of one or two bands in addition to the valvocopulae.
   Cyclotella marina differs from two other species of the genus known only
   from freshwater and also without a central valve-face fultoportula,
   namely C. meduanae Germain and C. katiana Sala et Ramirez, by having two
   satellite pores in the marginal fultoportulae and no ornamentation on
   the valve face. Cyclotella marina seems to be restricted to neritic
   shallow waters rich in nutrients originating in freshwater discharges
   and high detritus content. It may attach to submerged macrophytes until
   environmental conditions favour rapid growth and bloom formation in the
   water column. The record of this taxon in the Gulf of Mexico is the
   first report for both the American seas and the Atlantic Ocean,
   extending its known distribution beyond temperate waters.},

Abstract = {Personal Dose Equivalent (PDE) values were determined for occupational
   exposed workers (OEW) at the Nuclear Medicine Department (NMD) of
   ``Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia{''} (INCan), Mexico, using TLD-100
   thermoluminescent dosemeters. OEW at NMD, INCan make use of
   radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
   Radionuclides associated to a pharmaceutical compound used at this
   Department are I-131, F-18, Ga-68, Tc-99m, In-111 and C-11 with main
   gamma emission energies between 140 and 511 keV. Dosemeter calibration
   was performed at the metrology department of ``Instituto Nacional de
   Investigaciones Nucleares{''} (ININ), Mexico. Every occupational worker
   used dark containers with three dosimeters which were replaced monthly
   for a total of 5 periods. Additionally, control dosemeters were also
   placed at a site free of radioactive sources in order to determine the
   background radiation. Results were adjusted to find PDE/day and
   estimating annual PDE values in the range between 2 mSv (background) and
   9 mSv. The mean annual value is 3.51 mSv and the standard deviation SD
   is 0.78 mSv. Four of the 16 OEW received annual doses higher than the
   average +1 SD (4.29 mSv). Results depend on OEW daily activities and
   were consistent for each OEW for the 5 studied periods as well as with
   PDE values reported by the firm that performs the monthly service. All
   obtained values are well within the established annual OEW dose limit
   stated in the ``Reglamento General de Seguridad Radiolegica{''}, Mexico
   (50 mSv), as well as within the lower limit recommended by the
   ``International Commission on Radiation Protection{''} (ICRP), report
   no.60 (20 mSv). These results verify the adequate compliance of the NMD
   at INCan, Mexico with the norms given by the national regulatory
   commission.},

   animal models at 7 Tesla. This coil design is able to fully cover a

   was used because of its ability to accurately model complex problems in
   electromagnetism. This particular coil design is best suited for regions
   of interests with a spherical shape, since B1 uniformity is not
   significantly attenuated as in the case of a circular-loop coil. It
   still remains to investigate the feasibility to actually construct a

Abstract = {We focus on the contact between the anode and the electron donor (ED) in
   organic photovoltaic cells with planar heterojunction configuration.
   While the fullerene was the electron acceptor (EA), the
   terthiophene-pyran-malonitrile (T3PM) has been used as electron donor
   (ED). The HOMO and LUMO of T3PM have been estimated by electrochemical
   characterization to be -3.5 eV and -5.5 eV, which shows that it can be
   used as electron donor in a heterojunction with fullerene. The ITO
   contact plays a critical role in determining device efficiency, and the
   introduction of a thin anode buffer layer (ABL) between the ITO and the
   ED induces a significant improvement of the device efficiency. Different
   ABL have been used, the well-known Au and MoO3 and a more original, CuI,
   alone or coupled with MoO3. The thicknesses were 0.5 nm, 3.5 nm and 3 nm
   for Au, MoO3 and CuI respectively. It is shown that the ABL improve the
   cells performances. The best results are achieved with the couple
   MoO3/CuI through an increase of the open circuit voltage (Voc). Such
   improvement has been attributed to an increase of the shunt resistance.
   The influence of the ABLs can be explained partly by the fact that it
   raises the anode work function. Nevertheless, a study of the structures
   T3PM/ABL/ITO shows that the T3PM films grown on CuI are the most
   homogeneous which can explain the rise of the shunt resistance and
   therefore of Voc. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Open

Abstract = {The widespread montane Mexican horned lizard Phrynosorna orbiculare
   (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae) represents an ideal species to investigate
   the relative impacts of Neogene vicariance and Quaternary climate change
   on lineage diversification across the Mexican highlands. We used
   mitochondrial DNA to examine the maternal history of P. orbiculare and
   estimate the timing and tempo of lineage diversification. Based on our
   results, we inferred 11 geographically structured, well supported
   mitochondrial lineages within this species, suggesting P. orbiculare
   represents a species complex. Six divergences between lineages likely
   occurred during the Late Miocene and Pliocene, and four splits probably
   happened during the Pleistocene. Diversification rate appeared
   relatively constant through time. Spatial and temporal divergences
   between lineages of P. orbiculare and co-distributed taxa suggest that a
   distinct period of uplifting of the Transvolcanic Belt around 7.5-3
   million years ago broadly impacted diversification in taxa associated
   with this mountain range. To the north, several river drainages acting
   as filter barriers differentially subdivided co-distributed highland
   taxa through time. Diversification patterns observed in P. orbiculare
   provide additional insight into the mechanisms that impacted
   differentiation of highland taxa across the complex Mexican highlands.

Abstract = {Neogene vicariance during the Miocene and Pliocene and Quaternary
   climate change have synergistically driven diversification in Mexican
   highland taxa. We investigated the impacts of these processes on genetic
   diversification in the widely distributed bunchgrass lizards in the
   Sceloporus scalaris group. We searched for correlations between timing
   in diversification and timing of (1) a period of marked volcanism across
   the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico 3-7.5 million years
   ago (Ma) and (2) a transition to larger glacial-interglacial cycles
   during the mid-Pleistocene. From our phylogenetic analyses of
   mitochondrial DNA we identified two major clades that contained 13
   strongly supported lineages. One clade contained lineages from the two
   northern sierras of Mexico, and the other clade included lineages
   associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Central Mexican
   Plateau. Results provided support for Neogene divergences within the S.
   scalaris group in response to uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt,
   a pattern observed in several co-distributed taxa, and suggested that
   Quaternary climate change likely had little effect on diversification
   between lineages. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during
   specific time periods appears to have strongly impacted diversification
   in Mexican highland taxa. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   Butterflies Allow a Color Signal to Serve both Mimicry and Intraspecific

Abstract = {Mimetic wing coloration evolves in butterflies in the context of
   predator confusion. Unless butterfly eyes have adaptations for
   discriminating mimetic color variation, mimicry also carries a risk of
   confusion for the butterflies themselves. Heliconius butterfly eyes,
   which express recently duplicated ultraviolet (UV) opsins, have such an
   adaptation. To examine bird and butterfly color vision as sources of
   selection on butterfly coloration, we studied yellow wing pigmentation
   in the tribe Heliconiini. We confirmed, using reflectance and mass
   spectrometry, that only Heliconius use 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK),
   which looks yellow to humans but reflects both UV-and long-wavelength
   light, whereas butterflies in related genera have chemically unknown
   yellow pigments mostly lacking UV reflectance. Modeling of these color
   signals reveals that the two UV photoreceptors of Heliconius are better
   suited to separating 3-OHK from non-3-OHK spectra compared with the
   photoreceptors of related genera or birds. The co-occurrence of
   potentially enhanced UV vision and a UV-reflecting yellow wing pigment
   could allow unpalatable Heliconius private intraspecific communication
   in the presence of mimics. Our results are the best available evidence
   for the correlated evolution of a color signal and color vision. They
   also suggest that predator visual systems are error prone in the context
   of mimicry.},

Abstract = {It is well established that several doped aluminum clusters (M@Al-12),
   with 40 valence electrons and the dopant M at the center of the
   icosahedral Al-12 cage, present a highly stable icosahedral structure
   with electronic closed-shell and HOMO-LUMO gap comparable to C-60 and
   Au-20. It has also been shown that the 39 valence electrons cluster
   Al-13 could be regarded as a superhalogen superatom, with an electron
   affinity close to the chlorine atom. However, when an electron is
   detached from an electronic closed-shell icosahedral system, we end up
   with a degenerated HOMO state, showing a Jahn-Teller instability,
   undergoing therefore a structural distortion to remove the electron
   degeneracy by lowering the symmetry. In this work we perform a
   Jahn-Teller analysis of the electronic properties of the endohedral
   clusters M@Al-12 (M = B, Al, Ga) under the symmetry breaking process,
   lowering their I-h symmetry to D-2h for B and D-3d for Al and Ga. We
   show the necessity of taking into account this symmetry breaking in

Abstract = {Efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells, based on electron
   donor/electron acceptor junctions (ED/EA) could be strongly improved
   when the transparent conductive anode, is covered with a thin anode
   buffer layer (ABL) such as Au or MoO3. To study the influence of the
   HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) value of the organic material
   on the effectiveness of the anode buffer layer (ABL), different ED have
   been probed: pentacene, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc),
   tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) and, poly(benzo{[} c]
   thiophene-2-oxide) with 5 eV, 5.2 eV, 5.5 eV and 5.52 eV as HOMO value
   respectively. The effects of a metal (Au) or an oxide (MoO3) ABL are
   reported. The results indicate that the improvement of the cells
   performance depends on the value of the ABL work function. A good
   matching between the work function of the anode and the highest occupied
   molecular orbital of the organic electron donor is the most important
   factor limiting the hole transfer efficiency. It is shown that the MoO3
   oxide has a wider field of application as ABL than the Au metal. (C)

Abstract = {Some Mexican volcano mice (Neotomodon alstoni), when in captivity and
   fed regularly on a laboratory rodents' diet, develop obesity. The aims
   of the present work are to compare lean and obese mice with regard to
   the main characteristics of the sleep-wake cycle in 12:12 LD, and to
   investigate if there is a correlation with changes in metabolic-related
   blood parameters (leptin, insulin, triacylglycerides, corticosterone and
   the glucose tolerance test). The analysis of the sleep-wake cycle
   evaluated the temporal distribution of vigilance states and indicated a
   polyphasic architecture. Trends were observed in obese mice to have
   increased percentages of slow wave sleep and decreased wakefulness, but
   the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep was not different. Obese mice
   had higher concentrations of leptin and insulin, and showed a slower
   glucose removal from blood at noon than at midnight, indicating a
   possible resistance to these hormones. We propose that volcano mice are
   a good model for studying daily rhythms and metabolic disorders related
   to obesity.},

Title = {Molecular systematics of the genus Sonora (Squamata: Colubridae)
   in central and western Mexico},
Journal = {SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-108},
Abstract = {Mexico possesses high levels of endemic biodiversity, especially for
   squamate reptiles. However, the evolutionary relationships among many
   reptiles in this region are not well known. The closely related genera
   of Sonora Baird and Girard 1853 and Procinura Cope 1879 are coralsnake
   mimics found from the central and western United States to southwestern
   Mexico and Baja California. Although species delimitation in this group
   has historically relied upon colour pattern and other morphological
   characters, many populations of these species display colour pattern
   polymorphism, which may confound taxonomy. We used molecular
   phylogenetics to assess the evolutionary relationships and delimit
   species within Sonora, focusing on the phylogenetic position of
   Procinura and the validity of S. mutabilis and aequalis. We sequenced
   two mitochondrial (ND4 and cytb) and two nuclear (c-mos and RAG-1) genes
   for the single species of Procinura and each of the four species of
   Sonora. We analysed these sequences using maximum parsimony, maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on separately concatenated
   mitochondrial and nuclear datasets. Additionally, we used Bayesian
   coalescent methods to build a species tree (Bayesian species tree
   analysis) and delimit species boundaries (Bayesian species
   delimitation). All methods indicated that Procinura is deeply nested
   within Sonora, and most individual species are well supported. However,
   we found that one taxon (S. aequalis) is paraphyletic with regard to
   another (S. mutabilis). We recommend that the genus Procinura be
   synonymised with Sonora and that S. aequalis be synonymised with S.
   mutabilis. Additionally, the phylogenetic patterns that we document are
   broadly congruent with a Miocene or Pliocene divergence between S.
   michoacanensis and S. mutabilis along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.
   Finally, our data are consistent with the early evolution of coralsnake
   mimicry and colour pattern polymorphism within the genus Sonora.},

Abstract = {Octopus maya has high growth rates, direct embryonic development and
   high hatchling survival, making it a good candidate for aquaculture
   diversification. The present study was designed to evaluate growth rate,
   survival and food conversion of O. maya juveniles cultured in outdoor
   tanks. Octopuses were captured from the wild during the fishing season,
   and fed discarded fish heads and whole crabs. Three trials were
   conducted between 23 and 32 days, in September (trial 1), October (trial
   2) and November (trial 3) where a decrease in sea water temperature was
   registered (2924 degrees C, from September to November respectively).
   Octopuses were held in three outdoor tanks of 5 m2 of bottom area and
   0.5 m deep, aerated sea water and water flow allowing 10\% of water
   exchange per day. Initial density was between 2.9 and 3.8 kg m-3 with
   different initial mean weight of 542.3 +/- 18.8, 493 +/- 11.9 and 321
   +/- 7.8 g, for trials 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Specific growth rate
   varied between 1.8 and 2.7\% BW day-1 with no apparent relation with the
   culture temperature. These results put in evidence that tanks used are
   adequate for the ongrowing of O. maya juveniles, with commercial size
   being attained in a few weeks.},

Abstract = {The effects of diet freezing on the growth, survival and biochemical
   composition of the diets and juvenile spider crabs (Maja brachydactyla)
   were studied. Fresh and frozen (at -20 degrees C for 21 days) mussels,
   Mytilus edulis, were used as food. Two experiments were conducted and in
   each, spider crabs were placed in individual trays. During experiment I,
   40 juvenile spider crabs (2 months old) were used. Twenty animals (9 +/-
   2 mg) were fed fresh mussels, and 20 animals (8 +/- 2 mg) were fed
   frozen mussels. Spider crabs fed fresh mussels grew larger than the ones
   fed frozen mussels (304.0 +/- 118.0 and 70.0 +/- 40.1 mg respectively).
   During experiment II, 16 juvenile spider crabs (5 months old) were used.
   Eight animals (3.4 +/- 0.8 g) were fed fresh mussel and eight animals
   (4.1 +/- 1.3 g) were fed frozen mussel. Spider crabs fed with fresh
   mussels were larger than the ones fed with frozen mussels (92.5 +/- 41.7
   and 41.5 +/- 17.7 g respectively). There were no significant differences
   in the protein, amino acids and fatty acid composition between fresh and
   frozen mussels. The freezing procedure makes mussels less adequate for
   the culture of 2-month-old early juveniles of M. brachydactyla up to 5
   months, although they promoted acceptable growth and good survival in
   older animals (>5 months old).},

Abstract = {The assessment of biodiversity in coral reefs requires the application
   of geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and analytical
   tools in order to make cost-effective spatially explicit predictions of
   biodiversity over large geographic areas. Here we present a spatially
   explicit prediction for coral reef fish diversity index, as well as
   habitat classification according to reef fish diversity index values in
   Chinchorro Bank Biosphere Reserve, one of the most important plain/atoll
   type reef systems in the Caribbean. We have used extensive ecological
   data on depth, fish and habitat characteristics to perform such
   prediction. Fish species assemblages and different biotic variables of
   benthic organisms were characterized using visual censuses and
   video-transects, respectively at 119 sampling stations. The information
   was integrated in a GIS, along with satellite imagery (LANSDAT 7 ETM+)
   and a digital bathymetric model. From the recorded data and a
   hierarchical classification procedure, we obtained nine different
   classes of habitats. We used a generalized regression analysis and
   spatial prediction methodology to create predictive maps (GIS layers) of
   the different reef benthic components, and a second modeling run
   produced predictive maps of coral reef fish diversity index. Predictive
   accuracy of the diversity index map presented a good correlation
   coefficient (r = 0.87), with maximum diversity index values en
   reefscapes composed of aggregation of coral colonies with seagrass beds.
   The implementation of our application was successful for the prediction
   of fish diversity hot spots and surrogate habitats.},

Title = {Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural visualization of different

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {102-110},
Abstract = {Cell death is a process for maintaining homeostasis in tissues and
   organs. In the ovary, apoptotic cell death has been implicated in
   follicular atresia; in the elimination of the follicles that are not
   ovulated during adult life. Recent studies indicate that apoptosis and
   autophagy are two programmed processes of cell death. Apoptosis is
   performed by proteases called caspases and leads to such morphological
   traits as DNA fragmentation. Autophagy, in turn, is characterized by the
   exacerbated formation of autophagosomes; a process in which the amount
   of the LC3 and Lamp 1 proteins increases. In this study, oocytes from
   all stages of the estrous cycle of Wistar rats were analyzed. The
   apoptosis process was identified by immunodetecting active Caspase-3 and
   locating DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL technique. Autophagy was
   evaluated through immunodetection of the LC3 and Lamp 1 proteins, and by
   ultrastructural localization of autophagic vesicle formation. All
   techniques were conducted using the same oocytes. Results show that all
   phases of the estrous cycle contain dying oocytes that test positive
   simultaneously for apoptosis and autophagy markers. The highest level of
   apoptosis was found during estrus; while the proestrous stage had the
   highest level of autophagy. The diestrous and metestrous phases were
   characterized by a high frequency of the presence of markers of
   apoptosis and autophagy in the same oocyte. Our results demonstrate that
   during oocyte elimination in adult rats the proteins involved in both
   processes, apoptosis and autophagy, are present in the same cell at the
   same time.},

Abstract = {In this paper is analyzed the existence of periodic orbits in a
   predator-prey interaction, when the predator feeds on each one of the
   two age classes of the prey. Three families of models are considered in
   correspondence with different prey and predator behaviors. Specifically,
   a constant predation rate on the non reproductive class of the prey is
   considered in the first family; a Holling predation of type two on the
   non reproductive class is incorporated in the second and in the third
   family; a defense group mechanism of the reproductive class is
   introduced in the third family. We prove that these three families of
   models exhibit Hopf bifurcations and the Hopf periodic orbit is a local

Abstract = {The debate between A.I. Oparin's heterotrophic proposal of the origin of

   posteriori the beginning of life, was an autocatalytic, replicative
   gene, is analyzed. Although both recognized that what was needed was an
   interacting system contiguous in space and time, it is now rarely
   mentioned that this scientific confrontation went on for several decades
   against the background of intense ideological issues, political
   tensions, and scientific developments that include the rise and demise
   of Lysenkoism, on the one hand, and, on the other, the establishment of
   neoDarwinism and the birth of molecular biology. Whereas for Oparin life
   was the outcome of the step-wise slow process of precellular evolution
   in which membrane-bounded polymolecular systems played a key role,
   Muller argued that life started with the appearance of the first
   nucleic-acid (DNA) molecule in the primitive oceans. Oparin and Muller
   came from different scientific backgrounds and almost opposite
   intellectual traditions, so their common interest in the origin of life
   did nothing to assuage their opposing views, which as argued soon became
   part of the debates that took place within the framework of intense
   ideological confrontations.},

   Internet connection; the students have an active role in their process
   of learning, meaning that they are not restricted recipients of
   information, but that it is part of their formative process; there is an
   authentic management of knowledge among students (exchange of ideas,
   opinions, practices, experiences); and feedback.
   Derived from the above, the number of students who carry out their
   studies under this educational mode has increased significantly,
   generating in Higher Education Institutions the need to acquire the
   appropriate technological infrastructure and the implementation of the
   most suitable Learning Management Systems (LMS) to fulfill the academic
   needs in this mode.
   In this sense, this research paper a comparative analysis is carried out
   between learning management systems with private software (Blackboard
   and WebCT) and of open source software (Moodle, Dokeos and Claroline).
   The parameters for comparison employed in this research, are the
   installation, personalization of the environment, functionality,
   resources management, groups and profiles, functionalities of Web 2.0
   and the management of courses, in order to determine the optimum
   informatics solution for the implementation of educational programs in
   the mode of online education at the Computer Science Faculty of Mazatlan
   at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa.
   After the analysis of different solutions, it's important to find the
   effects of how the correct selection of a learning management system
   make an impact in the academic performance of students, comparing, the
   needs of student use, the ease of the user interface, management,
   design, etc.},

Title = {Corrosion inhibition in copper by isolated bacteria},
Journal = {ANTI-CORROSION METHODS AND MATERIALS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-17},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report a study of
   microbiological influenced corrosion (MIC) of copper due to bacteria
   strains isolated from potable water pipes and oxidation lagoons using
   electrochemical noise (EN) analysis and scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM).
   Design/methodology/approach - Bacteria strains isolated from copper
   surfaces of potable water pipes and from oxidation lagoons were
   identified, based on the 16S. rDNA gene sequence analysis. Corrosion
   studies were undertaken over a period of six weeks, placing copper
   electrodes inside an LB culture media with and without bacteria. The
   corrosion resistance was obtained using EN analysis. In all the cases,
   the corrosion type was identified. SEM images of the copper electrodes
   were taken to evaluate the surface condition.
   Findings - The bacteria strains identified were: Pantoea agglomerans,
   Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Brucellaceae bacterium,
   Enterobacter cloacae, Delftia tsuruhatensis, and Pseudochrobactrum
   asaccharolyticum. EN analysis gave noise resistance values in the range
   1,036-5,040 Omega cm(2) for the control samples and in the range of
   2,336-22,573 Omega cm(2) for samples that had been inoculated with
   bacteria. It was found that a decrease in the rate of corrosion took
   place due to the development of a biofilm by the microorganisms on the
   copper surface. SEM images corroborated the presence of the biofilm on
   the copper electrodes.
   Practical implications - The isolated bacteria strain reduced the rate
   of corrosion on the copper electrodes, as shown by the SEM images and EN
   analysis results, due to the formation of a biofilm that can act as an
   anticorrosive coating.
   Originality/value - Even though MIC is a known phenomenon, it has not
   been reported that isolated bacteria strains can reduce corrosion on the
   surface of copper potable water pipes and in oxidation lagoons.},

Abstract = {Yerba mate extracts have in vitro antioxidant capacity attributed to the
   presence of polyphenolic compounds, mainly chlorogenic acids and
   dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives. DPPH is one of the most used assays
   to measure the antioxidant capacity of pure compounds and plant
   extracts. It is difficult to compare the results between studies because
   this assay is applied in too many different conditions by the different
   research groups. Thus, in order to assess the antioxidant capacity of
   yerba mate extracts, the following procedure is proposed: 100 mu L of an
   aqueous dilution of the extracts is mixed in duplicate with 3.0 mL of a
   DPPH `work solution in absolute methanol (100 mu M.L-1), with an
   incubation time of 120 minutes in darkness at 37 +/- 1 degrees C, and
   then absorbance is read at 517 nm against absolute methanol. The results
   should be expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents or Trolox equivalents
   in mass percentage (g\% dm, dry matter) in order to facilitate
   comparisons. The AOC of the ethanolic extracts ranged between 12.8 and
   23.1 g TE \% dm and from 9.1 to 16.4 g AAE \% dm. The AOC determined by
   the DPPH assay proposed in the present study can be related to the total
   polyphenolic content determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay.},

Abstract = {The calico box crab Hepatus epheliticus is an abundant species from
   shallow and continental shelf waters of the Atlantic coast of USA and
   Mexico. Information about population structure and sexual maturity is
   absent, even though this crab is caught to be used as bait for the
   octopus fishery in the Campeche Bank, Mexico. In order to achieve such
   information, a total of 768 individuals were collected from January to
   March 2010 through baited traps installed in the Yucatan Peninsula,
   Mexico. Our results showed that sex ratio is biased towards more males
   than females (1:0.55), contradicting to that reported in other
   brachyuran crabs. The absence of ovigerous females suggests that they
   did not enter into the traps during embryogenesis. Males reached a
   larger maximum size than females (64.0 +/- 6.15 and 58.4 +/- 5.60 mm
   carapace width, respectively). The general scheme of growth being
   positive allometric throughout ontogeny of both sexes. Males presented a
   transition phase from juveniles to adult corresponding to the puberty
   moult. The estimation of the onset of functional sexual maturity
   revealed a steady situation for the population, with 21.5 and 13.8\% of
   males and females, respectively, morphologically immature at the time of
   catch. This study constitutes the first report on population structure
   and sexual maturity in a population of the calico box crab H.

Abstract = {At high field strengths, the need for more efficient high frequency
   coils has grown. Since the radiation losses and the interaction between
   coil and sample increase proportionally to field strength, the quality
   factor (Q) and the sensitivity of the coil decrease as consequence of
   these negative effects. Since Zhang et al proposed in 2001 a new surface
   coil based on the microstrip transmission line for high frequency,
   different Tx-Rx phased arrays based on this concept have been already
   introduced in animal and whole body systems at high field strengths,
   each of them with different modifications in order to get better field
   homogeneity, SNR or isolation between coil elements in the array. All
   these arrays for animals systems have been built for rat imaging. One of
   these modifications is called BI-Ground Microstrip Array Coil (BIGMAC).
   The implementation of a smaller two-channel BIGMAC design for mouse
   imaging is studied and its performance compared to a two-channel
   conventional Microstrip array at 7 Tesla, the higher isolation by using
   BIGMAC elements in comparison with conventional Microstrip elements is
   shown in this work.},

Abstract = {CTCF is a multifunctional nuclear factor involved in many cellular
   processes like gene regulation, chromatin insulation and genomic
   organization. Recently, CTCF has been shown to be involved in the
   transcriptional regulation of ribosomal genes and nucleolar organization
   in Drosophila cells and different murine cell types, including embryonic
   stem cells. Moreover, it has been suggested that CTCF could be
   associated to the nucleolus of human erythroleukemic K562 cells. In the
   present work, we took advantage of efficient small hairpin RNA
   interference against human CTCF to analyze nucleolar organization in
   HeLa cells. We have found that key components of the nucleolar
   architecture are altered. As a consequence of such alterations, an
   upregulation of ribosomal gene transcription was observed. We propose
   that CTCF contributes to the structural organization of the nucleolus
   and, through epigenetic mechanisms, to the regulation of the ribosomal
   gene expression. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) are a group of autosomal
   dominantly or recessively inherited muscular dystrophies that also
   present with primary proximal (limb-girdle) muscle weakness. This type
   of dystrophy involves the shoulder and pelvic girdles, distinct
   phenotypic or clinical characteristics are recognized. Imaging
   experiments were conducted on a 1.5T GE scanner (General Electric
   Medical Systems. Milwaukee. USA), using a combination of two
   eight-channel coil array. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data were
   acquired using a SE-EPI sequence, diffusion weighted gradients were
   applied along 30 non-collinear directions with a b-value=550 s/mm(2).
   The connective tissue content does not appear to have a significant
   effect on the directionality of the diffusion, as assessed by fractional
   anisotropy. The fibers of the Sartorius muscle and gracilis showed
   decreased number of tracts, secondary to fatty infiltration and
   replacement of connective tissue and muscle mass loss characteristic of
   the underlying pathology. Our results demonstrated the utility of
   non-invasive MRI techniques to characterize the muscle pathology,
   through quantitative and qualitative methods such as the FA values and
   tractrography.},

Journal = {SOFT MATTER},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {33},
Pages = {8666-8671},
Abstract = {Langevin dynamics simulations of the bead-spring model are employed to
   study the unfolding dynamics of a flexible hairpin polymer which has
   been inserted in a cylindrical nanochannel. Because the hairpin polymer
   is not in an equilibrium configuration the molecule starts unfolding
   until reaching a stretched configuration inside the tube. We study the
   effect of the channel diameter D on the unfolding relaxation time. The
   effect of the number of monomers N in the folded arm on the relaxation
   time is also investigated. We show the unfolding time tau R similar to
   DN2 for small channel diameters. These results can be explained and
   understood using scaling arguments of the polymer segregation theory.
   Our simulations are in agreement with experimental observations of DNA
   unfolding in solid-state nanochannels.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Data mining is very important to characterize complex geological
   structures, where a large variety of geophysical and petrophysical
   variables are typically involved and interrelated. In this paper we
   apply smooth regression for data analysis, by means of the Gamma test (a
   revolutionary estimator of the noise in a data set) to aid in the
   construction of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict
   effective porosity (phi(e)) using seismic attributes. As a result, we
   obtain the best combination of seismic attributes to estimate phi(e)
   briefly describe the Gamma test, its benefits in model identification
   and model building. The first validation of the Neural Network based on
   leave-one-out was poor. Therefore, we generate a complementary set of
   synthetic data (from the original well-log data), varying the effective
   porosity and applying the Gassmann's equation for fluid substitution to
   obtain resulting velocities and densities. The complete procedure is
   repeated including the new synthetic well-logs and the best suited
   selection of seismic attributes is used to train a new ANN producing a
   better validation and more accurate results. The advantage of smooth
   regression over other techniques is that it tells us how well we can
   predict phi(e) using any model. This information saves time during
   training of the ANN and also sets a lower bound for the mean squared
   error to prevent over-training. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {CONVEX UNIVERSAL FIXERS},
Journal = {DISCUSSIONES MATHEMATICAE GRAPH THEORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {807-812},
Abstract = {In {[}1] Burger and Mynhardt introduced the idea of universal fixers.
   Let G = (V, E) be a graph with n vertices and G' a copy of G. For a
   bijective function pi : V(G) -> V(G'), define the prism pi G of G as
   follows: V(pi G) = V(G) U V(G') and E(pi G) = E(G) U E(G') U M-pi,M-
   where M pi = \{u pi r(u) u is an element of V(G)\}. Let gamma(G) be the
   domination number of G. If gamma(pi G) = gamma(G) for any bijective
   function it, then G is called a universal fixer. In {[}9] it is
   conjectured that the only universal fixers are the edgeless graphs (K)
   over bar (n).
   In this work we generalize the concept of universal fixers to the convex
   universal fixers. In the second section we give a characterization for
   convex universal fixers (Theorem 6) and finally, we give an in infinite
   family of convex universal fixers for an arbitrary natural number n >=
   10.},

Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are critical habitats for many species, and their
   productivity is important because of their contribution of organic
   detritus and secondary production. The objective of this study was to
   identify suitable indicators of secondary productivity of mangrove
   systems, in order to establish a baseline for measuring changes in the
   mangrove system due to natural or anthropogenic potential disturbances.
   The bivalve mollusks chosen as indicators of secondary productivity were
   the mangrove cockle Anadara tuberculosa and the mangrove oyster
   Crassostrea palmula. Samples were collected in three estuaries from
   August 2007 to July 2009. Abundance and secondary production were
   estimated from biomass increase, calculated from individual growth rates
   determined using length frequency distributions analysis. The average
   abundance was 1.27 and 510 ind.m(-2) of mangrove cockle and mangrove
   oyster respectively. It was estimated a growth rate of 4.91 mm.month(-1)
   (3.67 g.month(-1)) for mangrove cockle and 3.80 mm.month(-1) (0.18
   g.month(-1)) for the mangrove oyster. The mean secondary production of
   mangrove cockle was 4.51 g.m(-2).month(-1) and was higher during spring,
   while for the mangrove oyster it was 97.9 g.m(-2).month(-1), and the
   maximum production was recorded during summer. The results show that
   these indicators of benthos quality are suitable for measuring changes
   of the mangrove system in the Ensenada of La Paz, B. C. S., Mexico.},

   hyperspace suspension is 1/2-homogeneous, then X must be continuum

   suspension for several classes of continua, including: continua
   containing a free arc, atriodic and decomposable continua, and
   decomposable irreducible continua about a finite set.},

Abstract = {Records of species of the peritrich ciliate genus Lagenophrys, obligate
   epibionts of crustaceans, were analysed using panbiogeographical track
   analysis to detect its worldwide distribution patterns. Track analysis
   of 28 species of this genus found five generalized tracks: (1)
   Euroamerican; (2) American; (3) Caribbean; (4) Tasmanian; and (5) South
   American. Two panbiogeographic nodes were found at the intersection of
   generalized tracks 1 and 2, and 2 and 5. The distributions of the
   Lagenophrys species show complex patterns that could be related to
   trophic opportunities, habitat and distribution of hosts, and other
   factors. The distribution patterns suggest that a number of allopatric
   events have caused regionalization of the taxa.},

Journal = {SYMMETRY INTEGRABILITY AND GEOMETRY-METHODS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Three sets of ladder operators in spheroconal coordinates and their
   respective actions on Lam e spheroconal harmonic polynomials are
   presented in this article. The polynomials are common eigenfunctions of
   the square of the angular momentum operator and of the asymmetry
   distribution Hamiltonian for the rotations of asymmetric molecules, in
   the body-fixed frame with principal axes. The first set of operators for
   Lame polynomials of a given species and a fixed value of the square of
   the angular momentum raise and lower and lower and raise in
   complementary ways the quantum numbers n(1) and n(2) counting the
   respective nodal elliptical cones. The second set of operators
   consisting of the cartesian components (L) over cap (x), (L) over cap
   (y), (L) over cap (z) of the angular momentum connect pairs of the four
   species of polynomials of a chosen kind and angular momentum. The third
   set of operators, the cartesian components (p) over cap (x), (p) over
   cap (y), (p) over cap (z) of the linear momentum, connect pairs of the
   polynomials differing in one unit in their angular momentum and in their
   parities. Relationships among spheroconal harmonics at the levels of the
   three sets of operators are illustrated.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of formation of two isomers, yellow and orange, of the
   cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, {[}Ru(o-C6H4-py)(MeCN)(4)](+), was
   investigated by EELS spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Both
   forms show very similar structures and spectroscopic properties, but
   slight differences in X-ray data and absorption between them were noted.
   No double minimum on the potential energy surface was found and thus
   these two forms cannot be considered as bond stretching isomers.
   However, the DFT study revealed the change in the hybridization of the
   carbon in trans-position of one of acetonitrile ligands. This effect can
   be responsible for the difference in colour. The results of the
   theoretical modelling coincide well with the experimental EELS data.},

Title = {Renin is an angiotensin-independent profibrotic mediator: role in

Journal = {EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is probably the
   result of interplay between cytokines/chemokines and growth factors. The
   renin-angiotensin (Ang) system is involved, although its profibrotic
   effect is attributed to Ang II. However, recent studies suggest that
   renin, through a specific receptor, is implicated in fibrogenesis.
   In this study, the expression of renin and renin receptor was examined
   in normal and IPF lungs and fibroblasts. Normal human lung fibroblasts
   were stimulated with renin or transfected with renin small interfering
   RNA (siRNA), and the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
   1 and alpha-1-type I collagen was analysed.
   Normal lungs and lung fibroblasts expressed renin, which was strongly
   upregulated in IPF lungs and fibroblasts (similar to 10-fold increase;
   p<0.05). Immunocytochemistry showed intense renin staining in IPF
   fibroblasts. Renin-stimulated lung fibroblasts displayed an increase in
   the expression of TGF-beta 1 (mean +/- SD 1.8 +/- 10(3) x 0.2 +/- 10(3)
   versus 1.2 +/- 10(3) x 0.3 +/- 10(3) mRNA copies per 18S ribosomal RNA;
   p<0.01) and collagen (5.93 +/- 10(2) x 0.66 +/- 10(2) versus 3.28 +/-
   10(2) 0.5 +/- 10(2); p<0.01), while knocking down renin expression using
   siRNA provoked a strong decrease of both molecules. These effects were
   independent of Ang II, since neither losartan nor captopril decreased
   these effects. Renin also decreased matrix metalloprotease-1 expression
   and induced TGF-beta 1 activation (163 +/- 34 versus 110 +/- 15 pg
   active TGF-beta 1 per mg total protein).
   These findings highlight the possible role of renin as an Ang
   II-independent profibrotic factor in lung fibrosis.},

Abstract = {A successful approach to improve organic photovoltaic cell performance
   is the introduction of a thin layer called the electron-blocking layer
   (EBL) at the interface organic material/cathode. Here, the effect of the
   EBL is discussed through the use of different multiheterojunction
   organic solar cells configurations. It is shown that, whatever the
   configuration used, classical or inverted cells, the EBL allows to
   significantly improve the solar cells performances. The optimum
   thickness of this layer is, whatever the solar cell configuration, 8-9
   nm. Both cell families permit achieving high short circuit current
   through this quite thick insulating layer. This invalidates the
   justification, proposed in the case of classical solar cells, based on
   Al diffusion into the exciton-blocking layer, since there is no metal
   deposition onto the exciton blocking layer in the case of inverted
   structure. Different hypothesis explaining the high electron current
   through the 8-9 nm of the large band gap EBL are proposed. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {The polymerization of amino acids under anhydrous prebiotic conditions
   was first studied several decades ago. Here we use a stochastic model
   stressing the relevant role of the polarity of amino acids in the
   formation of oligopeptides in a prebiotic milieu. Our goal is to outline
   the predominance of co-polypeptides over homo-polypeptides, resulting
   not only from the randomness, but also from polarity properties of amino
   acids. Our results conclude that there was a higher probability of the
   formation of co-polypeptides than of homo-polymers. Besides, we may
   hypothesize that the former would have a more ample spectrum of possible
   chemical functions than homo-polypeptides.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},

Pages = {15-24},
Abstract = {Unrestrained crayfish maintained in the dark exhibit a unimodal
   circadian activity that freely runs with a period of approximately 24 h
   rhythm that is able to entrain light-dark cycles. Although the activity
   rhythm has been shown to compensate for temperature, its potential for
   temperature synchronisation is unknown. In this work, we analysed the
   effects of cold-water pulses on crayfish locomotor activity. The
   crayfish were maintained under a 12: 12 light-dark (LD) cycle and 30-min
   cold (5 degrees C) water pulses were applied at three different
   circadian times (CTs). The crayfish were subsequently kept in darkness.
   Cold-water pulses applied at the beginning of the subjective night
   produced phase advances whereas pulses applied at the end of the
   subjective night produced phase delays. The magnitudes of the phase
   shifts were similar to those produced by light pulses but the direction
   was a mirror image. These findings suggest that the temperature- and
   light-synchronising pathways differ in crayfish.},

Title = {FLORA AND VEGETATION OF THE SEASONALLY DRY TROPICS IN MEXICO: ORIGIN AND
   BIOGEOGRAPHICAL IMPLICATIONS},
Journal = {ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {149-193},
Abstract = {Among the many explanations for the large biological diversity of Mexico
   is that it is the result of the contact between the Nearctic and
   Neotropical biotas; however, this contact-related explanation is not
   fully satisfactory and needs further examination in the light of
   historical biogeography. We offer newer insights into this issue by
   examining the history of the flora and the vegetation heterogeneity of
   the seasonally dry tropics of this country. Several environmental
   criteria can be used to define the seasonally dry tropical regions, but
   setting their precise geographical boundaries is not always
   straightforward. This is largely due to the large vegetation
   heterogeneity of this region, within which the tropical dry forest (TDF)
   is prominent. The origin of the TDF flora can be traced back at least as
   far as 20 million years before present and seems to be associated with
   the Tertiary North American flora. Available evidence does not support a
   South American origin of the TDF flora. Similarly, the separation of the
   TDF and the hot North American desert floras into two different
   biogeographical realms is not warranted. The history of the seasonally
   dry tropical flora of Mexico strongly suggests that this biogeographical
   dichotomy should be replaced by the recognition of the existence of a
   Pan-American Realm.},

Title = {The fruit of Bursera: structure, maturation and parthenocarpy},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2012},
Abstract = {Background and aims The deterioration of seasonally tropical dry forests
   will stop with the implementation of management plans for this
   ecosystem. To develop these plans, we require information regarding
   aspects such as germination and the presence of `empty seeds' of
   representative species-like, for example, Bursera, a genus with a high
   number of endemic species of the Meso-american Hotspot-that would enable
   us to propagate its species. The main purpose of this study is to
   describe the phenological and structural characteristics of fruits of 12
   Bursera species and provide useful data for future studies on
   germination and seed dispersal, and to acquire new and useful
   information to understand the phylogenetic relationships of the
   Burseraceae family.
   Methodology We described the phenology of fruit ripening in 12 species
   of Bursera. Fruits were collected from the study sites in three
   different stages of development. The histochemical and anatomical
   characteristics of fruits of all species were described with the use of
   inclusion techniques and scanning microscopy.
   Principal results There is a time gap between the development of the
   ovary and the development of the ovule in the 12 studied species. The
   exposed pseudoaril during the dispersion stage is an indicator of the
   seed's maturity and the fruit's viability. The Bursera fruit shows the
   same structural pattern as that of Commiphora, as well as many
   similarities with species of the Anacardiaceae family. All species
   develop parthenocarpic fruits that retain the structural characteristics
   of the immature fruits: soft tissues rich in nitrogen compounds and few
   chemical and physical defences. Insects were found mainly inside the
   parthenocarpic fruits in eight species of Bursera.
   Conclusions The dispersion unit in Bursera consists of a seed, a
   lignified endocarp that protects the seed, and a pseudoaril that helps
   attract seed dispersers. The production of parthenocarpic fruits is
   energy saving; however, it is necessary to evaluate the potential
   benefits of this phenomenon.},

Title = {SEASCAPE METRICS OF SHELF-MARGIN REEFS AND REEF SAND APRONS OF HOLOCENE
   CARBONATE PLATFORMS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {82},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {53-71},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Shelf-margin reefs and reef sand aprons are important geomorphic and
   facies elements associated with many isolated platforms today and in the
   stratigraphic record. Although it is generally appreciated that
   shelf-margin reefs and reef sand aprons have formed at or near breaks in
   slope at the rims of platforms throughout geologic time, possible
   environmental causes for variation in their sizes are not well
   understood. To provide better constraints for assessing possible reasons
   for such variability in ancient systems, this study relates local,
   regional, and global patterns of variation in the seascape attributes of
   Holocene shelf-margin reef and reef sand apron systems to a suite of
   potential environmental controls.
   Landsat data from more than 60 isolated carbonate platforms and atolls
   from the Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, Central
   Pacific Ocean, South China Sea, and Indonesian Seas were investigated by
   digitization and spatial analysis of facies belts, and compared with
   regional environmental parameters. The results of this analysis suggest
   that: (1) Reefs cover from < 1 to 55\% of the spatial extent of
   lithotopes on platforms (mean = 20\%), whereas reef sand aprons
   represent between 0 and 65\% (mean = 20\%). (2) The spatial extent of
   reefs is inversely related to platform size, but reef sand aprons show
   no comparable trend. (3) Widths of reefs and reef sand aprons are
   variable within and among platforms, but widths from all platforms and
   from platforms within different regions are characterized by log-normal
   size-frequency distributions. (4) Widths of these facies belts vary as a
   function of environmental factors such as swell period, swell height,
   tidal amplitude, latitude, and margin orientation relative to direction
   of wind and wave approach.
   These data indicate the presence of trends in widths of facies belts
   within different regions that correlate with regional oceanographic
   patterns. Nonetheless, marked variability is evident on individual
   platforms, among platforms within each region, and globally; these
   variations are not related to any of the parameterized environmental
   variables. This observation are interpreted to reflect the influences of
   unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) spatial and historical
   contingencies such as the depth to bedrock, character of earlier
   Holocene sea-level change, or changes in physical oceanographic state
   (waves or tides). The collective influence of these parameters, each of
   which individually may have the potential to invoke a deterministic
   response, may be reflected in reef and sand aprons with log-normal
   width-frequency distributions, interpreted to reflect multiplicative
   random effects. Collectively, however, these results suggest that
   accurate, a priori prediction of the details of the sizes of analogous
   facies bodies in the stratigraphic record may be impossible, especially
   in the deep geologic past, where biologic and physical controls are even
   less well constrained.},

Title = {Feasibility of the Detection of Trace Elements in Particulate Matter
   Using Online High-Resolution Aerosol Mass Spectrometry},
Journal = {AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {46},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1187-1200},
Abstract = {The feasibility of using an online thermal-desorption electronionization
   high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) for the detection of
   particulate trace elements was investigated by analyzing data from
   Mexico City obtained during the MILAGRO 2006 field campaign. This
   potential application is of interest due to the real-time data provided
   by the AMS, its high sensitivity and time resolution, and the widespread
   availability and use of this instrument. High-resolution mass spectral
   analysis, isotopic ratios, and ratios of different ions containing the
   same elements are used to constrain the chemical identity of the
   measured ions. The detection of Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sn, and Sb is reported.
   There was no convincing evidence for the detection of other trace
   elements commonly reported in ambient particulate matter (PM). The
   elements detected tend to be those with lower melting and boiling
   points, as expected given the use of a vaporizer at 600 degrees C in
   this instrument. The detection limit (DL) is estimated at approximately
   0.3 ng m(-3) for 5 min of data averaging. Concentration time series
   obtained from the AMS data were compared to concentration records
   determined from offline analysis of particle samples from the same times
   and locations by inductively coupled plasma based techniques (ICP;
   PM2.5) and proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE; PM1.1 and PM0.3). The
   degree of correlation and agreement between the three instruments (AMS,
   ICP, and PIXE) varied depending on the element. The AMS shows promise
   for real-time detection of some trace elements, although additional work
   including laboratory calibrations with different chemical forms of these
   elements is needed to further develop this technique and to understand
   the differences with the ambient data from the other techniques. The
   trace elements peaked in the morning as expected for primary sources,
   and the many detected plumes suggest the presence of multiple point
   sources, probably industrial, in Mexico City, which are variable in time
   and space, in agreement with previous studies.},

Title = {Study of the regional air quality south of Mexico City (Morelos state)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {414},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Results from the first study of the regional air quality in Morelos
   state (located south of Mexico City) are presented. Criteria pollutants
   concentrations were measured at several sites within Morelos in February
   and March of 2007 and 2009; meteorological data was also collected along
   the state for the same time periods; additionally, a coupled
   meteorology-chemistry model (Mesoscale Climate Chemistry Model, MCCM)
   was used to gain understanding on the atmospheric processes occurring in
   the region. In general, concentrations of almost all the monitored
   pollutants (O-3, NOx, CO, SO2, PM) remained below the Mexican air
   quality standards during the campaign; however, relatively high
   concentrations of ozone (8-hour average concentrations above the 60 ppb
   level several times during the campaigns, i.e. exceeding the World
   Health Organization and the European Union maximum levels) were observed
   even at sites with very low reported local emissions. In fact, there is
   evidence that a large percentage of Morelos vegetation was probably
   exposed to unhealthy ozone levels (estimated AOT40 levels above the 3
   ppm h critical limit). The MCCM qualitatively reproduced ozone daily
   variations in the sites with an urban component; though it consistently
   overestimated the ozone concentration in all the sites in Morelos. This
   is probably because the lack of an updated and detailed emission
   inventory for the state. The main wind patterns in the region
   corresponded to the mountain-valley system (downslope flows at night and
   during the first hours of the day, and upslope flows in the afternoon).
   At times, Morelos was affected by emissions from surrounding states
   (Distrito Federal or Puebla). The results are indicative of an efficient
   transport of ozone and its precursors at a regional level. They also
   suggest that the state is divided in two atmospheric basins by the
   Sierras de Tepoztlan, Texcal and Monte Negro. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {HIDROBIOLOGICA},

Volume = {22},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The upper Lerma River is the most economically important basin of Mexico
   because it is the region where 80 \% of the commercial activity of the
   country takes place, with 3500 industries, 750,000 Ha of irrigated land
   and 14 cities with populations over 100,000 inhabitants. Despite this
   relevance, little or no waste water treatment is done in the basin,
   which results in high contamination levels. The present paper deals with
   the taxonomy and ecology of epilithic diatoms collected at 11 sites in
   the basin in the dry and post-rainy seasons of the 2003-2005 period.
   This is the first study in an environmental direction of the diatoms of
   the upper Lerma River basin and the information generated will be used
   to propose, in the short-term, a Lerma River diatom index (IDL),
   supporting water quality monitoring programs. 178 taxa were recognized,
   of which 112 taxa (63\%) were cosmopolitan or widely distributed. The
   genera with most species were Nitzschia (34), Navicula (19), Gomphonema
   (15), and Pinnularia (11). The dominant species in the studied locations
   and study period were Eolimna subminuscula (Manguin) Moser,
   Lange-Bertalot et Metzeltin, Gomphonema parvulum (K tzing) K tzing,
   Navicula veneta K tzing, Nitzschia capitellata Hustedt, N. sublinearis
   Hustedt, N. umbonata (Ehrenberg) Lange-Bertalot and Sellaphora pupula (K
   tzing) Mereschkowsky, which are characterized as tolerant to
   a-me-so-sa-probic to polysaprobic conditions, and to high nitrogen
   content. Trends in distribution of diatom species in the sampling sites
   were explained by variations in environmental parameters such as depth,
   conductivity, pH, temperature, and total dissolved solids.},

Abstract = {A single imaging modality cannot provide information on all aspects of
   structure and function. The combination of positron emission tomography
   and magnetic resonance imaging offers tantalizing opportunities, but
   also significant challenges. In particular, cross talk between the
   magnetic resonance imaging transceiver and the positron emission
   tomography digital electronics can lead to interfering RF noise in both
   imaging modalities. The electromagnetic shielding minimizes the RF
   interference between the instruments, minimizing MRI artifacts and
   protecting the delicate components of the PET electronics from MRI RF
   pulses. The acquired image is degraded in the presence of the
   electromagnetic shield and the RF coil is one of the components that can
   improve the image quality. The saddle coil array showed a better RF
   field uniformity than the others in the axial direction.},

Title = {Assessing extinction risks under the combined effects of climate change

Abstract = {Plastic responses of species to unprecedented conditions and increased
   variability caused by climate change (CC) and anthropogenic disturbances
   are expected to play a major role determining populations' extinction
   risk. We developed a method for assessing CC effects on population
   dynamics based on analyzing plastic life history responses to weather
   conditions within an ensemble forecasting framework. The method is
   illustrated using two threatened cactus species with contrasting
   distribution ranges. Demographic models were parameterized using 5 years
   of field data, from which the relationship between life-history traits
   and rainfall and temperature was estimated. These functions were used in
   Integral Projection Models to predict population growth under CC
   scenarios and different anthropogenic disturbance regimes. Both species
   were affected by CC and its interaction with disturbance. The most
   widespread species was less affected by CC, suggesting that past
   selection on plasticity allows it to survive under variable conditions.
   Managing disturbance appropriately lessened the impact of CC. Some
   directives for conservation under CC were identified based on projected
   elasticity values. Our procedure for modeling population dynamics as a
   function of climate may be used for designing management plans for
   conservation or sustainable use aimed at important plant sizes or
   life-history traits, predicting potential distributions, and identifying
   viable populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Herein we describe some aspects of the ethnobotanical use and the first
   alkaloid profile of Lupinus jaimehintoniana, the 5 to 8 m high arboreous
   lupine. Five quinolizidine alkaloids identified as sparteine,
   5,6-dehydrolupanine, lupanine, nuttalline, and d-thermopsine, were
   characterized by the respective elution order according to their
   electronic impact spectra, lupanine being the most abundant in the four
   different tissues analyzed. Simultaneously, an antibacterial assessment
   of the four corresponding crude methanolic extracts, as well as the four
   semi-purified alkaloids was performed on specific Escherichia coli and
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains. These experiments resulted in MIC
   ranges of 37-61 mu g mL(-1) and 130-146 mu g mL(-1), respectively, for
   both bacterial species. Finally, the allelopathic activity of these
   extracts on the germination of Lactuca sativa seeds was demonstrated to
   be in the range of 50-300 mu g mL(-1) for both semi-purified alkaloid
   and methanolic extracts.},

Journal = {TALLER DE LETRAS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {50},
Pages = {119-128},
Abstract = {The following text analizes the novel Morena en rojo,written by the
   mexican-argentinian author Miriam Laurini. Published in 1994, it
   adresses one of the most stabbing problems of nowadays Mexico: child and
   teenagers trafficking, masterminded and executed by plenty of criminal
   networks, -translated into ilegal adoptions, exploitation, prostitution,
   pornography and sexual abuse (including rape and murder), pederasty,
   etc.- exposing the legal and policial inefficency and corruption, along
   with the lack of sensitivity of the authorities and even of society. The
   novel labels under the noir genre, with great global reach, for the
   latter allows the narration -and denounce- of a society in which the
   links between politics and corruption get narrower as time goes by. The
   novel is particularly important given the low number of female mexican
   authors that explore the noir gender, unlike it is in other countries.
   Equally interesting is the perspective of the gender present in the
   novel. The narrative is in charge of a female journalist who goes across
   different Mexican states investigating child trafficking, and in the
   meantime, she registers the life of different female characters who
   suffer, in many ways, the weight of social violence (which goes hand in
   hand with politic violence) in a country in which, nowadays, the job of
   a journalist has become a dangerous one thanks to the almost
   uncontrollable violence that dominates most of the social environments.

   Powdery mildew of beans is a disease in Northern Sinaloa state in
   Mexico, however, the identity of the causal agent, which is an obligate
   parasite, has not yet been elucidated due to lacking formation on its
   teleomorph. The objective of this study was to identify the causal agent
   of the disease through morphometric studies of the anamorph, and
   molecular techniques based on the ITS (internal transcribed spacers)
   region of the ribosomal DNA. We collected ten samples of different bean
   varieties that exhibited symptoms of the disease in the Fuerte Valley
   during the 2006-2007 fall/winter growing season. Morphological
   characteristics of the anamorph and the molecular phylogenetic analysis
   revealed that the causal fungus belongs to the mitosporic genus Oidium
   subgenus Pseudoidium. All samples had conidiophores of the Pseudoidium
   type, whose conidia were mainly cylindrical, and when partially
   collapsed, their walls showed longitudinal wrinkling, except on their
   ends, where the wall appeared almost smooth. Phylogenetic analysis of
   the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA region revealed that our collections of powdery
   mildew of beans are closely related to specimens of Erysiphe diffusa
   associated with soybeans and to an Erysiphe sp. associated with
   Phaseolus vulgaris.},

Abstract = {The paper gives an analysis of the pattern of soil cover of the Sierra
   Madre del Sur, one of the most complex physiographic regions of Mexico.
   It presents the results of the study of four latitudinal traverses
   across the region. We show that the distribution of soils in the Sierra
   Madre del Sur is associated with major climatic gradients, namely by
   vertical bioclimatic zonality in the mountains and by the effect of
   mountain shadow. Altitudinal distribution of soil-bioclimatic belts is
   complex due to non-uniform gradients of temperature and rainfall, and
   varies with the configuration of the mountain range. The distribution of
   soils is associated with the erosion and accumulation rates both on
   mountain slopes and in river valleys. The abundance of poorly developed
   soils in (semi)arid areas was ascribed to high erosion rate rather than
   to low pedogenetic potential. The formation of soil mosaic at a larger
   scale might be ascribed to the complex net of gully erosion and to the
   system of seismically triggered landslides of various ages. In the
   valleys, the distribution of soils depends upon the dynamics of
   sedimentation and erosion, which eventually exposes paleosols.
   Red-colored clayey sediments are remains of ancient weathering and
   pedogenesis. Their distribution is associated mainly with the intensity
   of recent slope processes. The soil cover pattern of the Sierra Madre
   del Sur cannot be explained by simplified schemes of bioclimatic
   zonality. The soil ranges can be explained by the distribution of
   climates, lithology, complex geological history of the region, and
   recent geomorphological processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Community Structure in Field and Cultured
   Microbialites from the Alkaline Lake Alchichica (Mexico)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {The geomicrobiology of crater lake microbialites remains largely unknown
   despite their evolutionary interest due to their resemblance to some
   Archaean analogs in the dominance of in situ carbonate precipitation
   over accretion. Here, we studied the diversity of archaea, bacteria and
   protists in microbialites of the alkaline Lake Alchichica from both
   field samples collected along a depth gradient (0-14 m depth) and
   long-term-maintained laboratory aquaria. Using small subunit (SSU) rRNA
   gene libraries and fingerprinting methods, we detected a wide diversity
   of bacteria and protists contrasting with a minor fraction of archaea.
   Oxygenic photosynthesizers were dominated by cyanobacteria, green algae
   and diatoms. Cyanobacterial diversity varied with depth, Oscillatoriales
   dominating shallow and intermediate microbialites and Pleurocapsales the
   deepest samples. The early-branching Gloeobacterales represented
   significant proportions in aquaria microbialites. Anoxygenic
   photosynthesizers were also diverse, comprising members of
   Alphaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi. Although photosynthetic
   microorganisms dominated in biomass, heterotrophic lineages were more
   diverse. We detected members of up to 21 bacterial phyla or candidate
   divisions, including lineages possibly involved in microbialite
   formation, such as sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria but also
   Firmicutes and very diverse taxa likely able to degrade complex
   polymeric substances, such as Planctomycetales, Bacteroidetes and
   Verrucomicrobia. Heterotrophic eukaryotes were dominated by Fungi
   (including members of the basal Rozellida or Cryptomycota),
   Choanoflagellida, Nucleariida, Amoebozoa, Alveolata and Stramenopiles.
   The diversity and relative abundance of many eukaryotic lineages suggest
   an unforeseen role for protists in microbialite ecology. Many lineages
   from lake microbialites were successfully maintained in aquaria.
   Interestingly, the diversity detected in aquarium microbialites was
   higher than in field samples, possibly due to more stable and favorable
   laboratory conditions. The maintenance of highly diverse natural
   microbialites in laboratory aquaria holds promise to study the role of
   different metabolisms in the formation of these structures under
   controlled conditions.},

Abstract = {The weevil tribe Listroderini (Curculionidae: Cyclominae) was originally
   recognized for a group of New World taxa. During the last decades its
   concept was expanded, and additional new taxa were described from the
   Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and the Tristan da Cunha-Gough
   islands. This checklist evaluates the nomenclatural status of all the
   generic and specific names applied to listroderines. A total of 407
   species classified into 36 genera are recognized. The following
   synonymies are established: Gromilus insularis robustus Brookes, 1951
   and G. insularis antipodarum Kuschel, 1964 = G. insularis Blanchard,
   1853; Gromilus veneris setarius Broun, 1909 = G. veneris (Kirsch, 1877);
   and Listronotus oregonensis tessellatus Casey, 1895 = L. oregonensis
   (LeConte, 1876). Two secondary homonyms were detected and replacement
   names are proposed: Gromilus brounii for G. setosus (Broun, 1917 non
   Broun, 1893), and Gromilus kuschelii for G. striatus (Broun, 1921 non

Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease
   of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once
   thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence
   indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated
   alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that
   induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the
   proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating
   fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
   The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of
   extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and
   destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial
   activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal
   recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a
   role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course,
   therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in
   the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

Abstract = {An investigation of ambient dose at the Nuclear Medicine Department,
   Institut Nacional de Cancerologia. Mexico, was performed using two types
   of thermoluminescent dosemeters: TLD-100 and TLD-900. In addition,
   ambient dose was measured at the outside corridor of the hospitalization
   room for, (CS)-C-137 brachytherapy patients. Radionuclides used at the
   Nuclear Medicine Department are I-131, F-18, Ga-67, Tc-99m, In-111,
   Tl-201 Main gamma emission energies from these elements are in the range
   from 93 to 511 keV. High dose values were obtained at the waste storage
   room, the outside corridor of I-131 patients, the PET/CT room and the
   outside corridor of Cs-137 brachytherapy patients. The maximum ambient
   dose equivalent rate equal to about 19 mu Sv/h was obtained for the
   Cs-137 brachytherapy corridor. Sites with minimum doses are the gamma
   camera rooms, having ambient dose equivalent rates equal to about 0.05
   mu Sv/h. At most sites where both types of dosemeters were placed
   ambient dose equivalent values obtained with TLD-900 were 25-45\% higher
   than TLD-100 values. This result was attributed to scattered radiation
   producing low energy photons which results in over response of TLD-900
   and thus, TLD-100 values are considered to be more reliable. Knowledge
   of ambient dose values is relevant to the occupational exposure
   personnel who may limit the time spent at high dose areas.
   Recommendations were given to the Department authorities to implement
   actions in order to reduce doses at high dose sites in order to comply
   with the ALARA principle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   101, 146, 147, 192, 212 atoms and nu = 0, +/- 1). The structures have
   been obtained from first principles generalized gradient approximation,
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on norm-conserving
   pseudopotentials and numerical atomic basis sets. We have found two new
   disordered or defective isomers lower in energy than their ordered
   counterparts for n = 101, 147. The purpose of this work is to
   systematically study the difference between the electronic properties of
   the two lowest ordered and disordered isomers for each size. Our results
   agree with previous first principle calculations and with some recent
   experimental results (Au-20 and Au-101). For each case we report total
   energies, binding energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities,
   density of states, highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied
   molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gaps, Housdorff chirality measure index
   and their simulated image in a high resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HRTEM). The calculated properties of the two low lying
   (ordered and disordered) isomers show clear differences as to be singled
   out in a suitable experimental setting. An extensive discussion on the
   evolution with size of the cohesive energy, the ionization potentials,
   the electron affinities, the HOMO-LUMO gaps and their index of chirality
   to determine the crossover between them is given.},

Title = {Phylogeny, biogeography, and display evolution in the tree and brush
   lizard genus Urosaurus (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The brush and tree lizards (Urosaurus) are a small clade of
   phrynosomatid lizards native to western North America. Though not as
   well known as their diverse sister clade, the spiny lizards
   (Sceloporus), some Urosaurus have nonetheless become model organisms in
   integrative biology. In particular, dramatic phenotypic and behavioral
   differences associated with specific mating strategies have been
   exploited to address a range of ecological and evolutionary questions.
   However, only two phylogenies have been proposed for the group, one of
   which is pre-cladistic and both based principally on morphological
   characters that might not provide robust support for relationships
   within the group. To help provide investigators working on Urosaurus
   with a robust phylogeny in which to frame ecological and evolutionary
   questions, we establish a molecular phylogeny for the group. We sampled
   three mitochondrial and three nuclear loci, and estimated phylogenetic
   relationships within Urosaurus using both maximum parsimony (MP) and
   Bayesian inference (BI), as well as a coalescent-based species tree
   approach. Finally, we used two methods of ancestral state reconstruction
   (ASR) to gain insight into the evolution of microhabitat preference and
   male display signals, traits that have been the focus of studies on
   Urosaurus. All reconstruction methods yield nearly the same ingroup
   topology that is concordant in most respects with the previous cladistic
   analysis of the group but with some significant differences; our data
   suggest the primary divergence in Urosaurus occurs between a clade
   endemic to the Pacific versant of Mexico and the lineages of Baja
   California and the southwestern US, rather than placing Urosaurus
   graciosus as the basal taxon and linking the Baja and Mexican endemics.
   We find support for a single transition to a saxicolous lifestyle within
   the group, and either the independent gain or loss of arboreality. The
   evolution of throat color patterns (i.e. dewlaps) appears complex, with
   multiple color morphs likely involving orange reconstructed as ancestral
   to the group and to most lineages, followed by a single transition to a
   fixed blue-throated morph in one clade. These results should provide a
   useful framework for additional comparative work with Urosaurus, and
   establish the phylogenetic context in which Urosaurus diversity arose.

Abstract = {A low-pressure DC plasma discharge sustained in a
   1.6\%Ar-2.7\%N-2-95.3\%CO2 ternary mixture is studied. This plasma was
   generated in a total pressure range from 1.0 to 4.0 Torr, a power of 6.3
   W and a 12 l/min flow rate of gases. The electron temperature was found
   to be 8.41 eV and the ion density, in the order of 10(9) cm(-3). The
   species observed in the plasma mixture were CO2, CO2+, CN, CO, CO+, O-2,
   O-2(+), N-2, N-2(+), NO, C+, Ar and Ar+ At the pressure range in the
   present study, the species observed do not change their intensity due to
   an increase in the pressure and they separate in two groups according to
   their emission intensity: the band of the first group (CO2, CO2+ and CN)
   is approximately a factor of 3 more intense than that of the second
   group (CO, CO+, O-2, O-2(+), N-2, N-2(+), NO, C+, Ar and Ar+). The
   behavior of the emission intensities may be correlated to the constant
   ion density and electron temperature measured. Also, we observed the
   same constant behavior in the ratios of the neutral and positive species
   intensities to that of the N-2 intensity, as a function of pressure.
   This may suggest that the different rate coefficients and cross sections
   of elastic collision, excitation and de-excitation of electronic or
   vibrational levels, inelastic and superelastic collisions of electrons
   with the gas phase and products, neutral-neutral interactions, resonant
   charged transfer processes, recombination, to mention some, to produce
   these species change in the same proportion, as a function of the
   pressure to keep the relative ratios of the species almost constant. (C)

Abstract = {Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an inflammatory lung disease
   characterized by an influx of activated T cells to the lung, in which
   the CD28/B7 costimulatory signals are essential for the T cell
   activation and the outcome of the inflammatory response. In this study,
   we investigated the effect of the CD28/B7 antagonist, CTLA-4Ig, on the
   lung inflammation and the T cell subset profile in experimental
   Saccharopolyspora recivirgula (SR)-induced HP. C57BL/6 mice were treated
   with SR or saline during two and three weeks and in addition of CTLA-4Ig
   was administrated after either the second or third week and mice were
   sacrificed seven days later. The extent of the lung inflammation was
   quantified by histopathology and the lung T cell subsets (Treg, Th17,
   gamma delta T and NKT) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mice treated
   with CTIA-4Ig showed a significant decrease in the extent of lung damage
   ( p < 0.05), and exhibited a decreased number of inflammatory cells in
   the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with diminished CD4/CD8 T cell ratio.
   Also, a significant increase in the percentage of lung gamma delta T ( p
   < 0.01) and NKT (p < 0.05) cells was observed in two weeks SR-treated
   mice with the administration of CTLA-4Ig/SR. At 3 weeks, SR-treated mice
   showed an increased percentage of regulatory T cells but no
   significantly differences were found in the percentage of Th17 cells
   when compared with CTLA-4Ig/SR-treated mice. Our findings suggest that
   the treatment with CTLA-4Ig affects the HP progression and the lung T
   cell subset kinetics in mice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Population growth poses threats to biodiversity, specifically to
   sensitive species. Therefore, an understanding: of the conflict between
   biodiversity and human population is needed to enable long-term planning
   of development and conservation policies by state and federal
   governments and society based on limitations and potentials of
   environments We used a geopolitical approach to analyze data on human
   demography, economic activities, natural vegetation, aviar diversity,
   and protected areas of the 32 states of Mexico and the 30 districts of
   the state of Oaxaca. Using factor analysis, we identified the
   biodiversity-rich geopolitical units that have a large human population
   and are developing intense economic activities. We then carried out a
   series of linear regressions between the resulting factors to test
   whether they were related, suggesting areas where conservation conflicts
   may exist, and found that relations between human activities and natural
   resources vary from region to region. These results help us identify
   geopolitical units that require detailed studies of the interactions
   between population and natural resources, and also highlight the
   importance of using geopolitical scales as study units, where most
   conservation and development policies are determined, to inform local
   stakeholders and decision makers.},

Abstract = {In order to establish the helminthological record of the viviparous fish
   species Zoogoneticus purhepechus, 72 individuals were collected from 2
   localities, La Luz spring (n= 45) and Los Negritos spring (n= 27), both
   in the lower Lerma River, in Michoacan state, Mexico. Twelve helminth
   taxa were recovered, 5 adults (the digeneans Margotrema bravoae and
   Phyllodistomum sp., the cestode Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, the
   nematode Rhabdochona lichtenfelsi and the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus
   cf. bulbocolli), and 7 larvae (the metacercariae of Clinostomum
   complanatum, the cysticercoid of Cyclophyllidea, the nematodes
   Rhabdochona sp., Eustrongylides sp., Contracaecum sp. and Spiroxys sp.,
   and the cysthacanth of Polymorphus brevis). Of these, R. lichtenfelsi
   was the most prevalent and abundant species at La Luz spring with 15.6\%
   and 0.33 individuals per analyzed host. The remaining species were
   relatively more rare and infrequent. The helminth parasite community of
   Z. purhepechus at Los Negritos spring was remarkably poor and abundance
   was very low. The omnivorous feeding habits, the position of the host
   species in the food web, and the environmental characteristics of each
   locality are suggested as the main factors determining the helminth
   parasite communities in this freshwater fish.},

Abstract = {The actual knowledge about the freshwater algae of Mexico is very uneven
   from various points of view, despite its recognized potential as
   indicators of environmental conditions and to be the basal part of
   trophic chains in aquatic environments. The largest number of records of
   algae is in the central area of the country, with five states comprising
   more than 56\% of total number of records. The Bacillariophyta are the
   group with the highest number of records, both nationally and by number
   of states. To this inequality, must be added that there is generally a
   poor level of documentation of species. There are records with the
   species name only and whose description or illustration has not been
   possible to locate, even with the recent documentary search resources.
   The graphical review presented highlights the degree of knowledge we
   have of the algae by states, taxonomical groups and the most studied
   environments; the discussion is supported with some analysis of the
   causes that affect the poor knowledge of freshwater algae in Mexico.},

Abstract = {The vegetation of the Magdalena river basin is continuously removed. The
   ecological restoration strategies include the use of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi, since these fungi may increase the establishment and
   survivorship of plants in the field. To identify the arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi species from Quercus rugosa's rhizosphere and to
   estimate the fungi root colonization, root and soil were sampled. To
   evaluate the growth and survivorship of mycorrhizal plants, Q. rugosa
   seedlings were grown on two conditions (treatments): sterilized native
   soil (-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and non-sterilized native soil
   (+arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi); afterwards, they were introduced to the
   field. We identified ten arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species in the
   rhizosphere, mean values of root colonization were superior to 50\%. The
   highest survivorship values were reported on + arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi treatment; although growth traits values did not show significant
   differences. Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased the
   establishment and survivorship of Q. rugosa's seedlings; these results
   support the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in ecological
   restoration programs.},

Abstract = {Stanley Miller's 1958 H2S-containing experiment, which included a
   simulated prebiotic atmosphere of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), carbon
   dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced several alkyl amino
   acids, including the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-isomers of aminobutyric
   acid (ABA) in greater relative yields than had previously been reported
   from his spark discharge experiments. In the presence of H2S, aspartic
   and glutamic acids could yield alkyl amino acids via the formation of
   thioimide intermediates. Radical chemistry initiated by passing H2S
   through a spark discharge could have also enhanced alkyl amino acid
   synthesis by generating alkyl radicals that can help form the aldehyde
   and ketone precursors to these amino acids. We propose mechanisms that
   may have influenced the synthesis of certain amino acids in localized
   environments rich in H2S and lightning discharges, similar to conditions
   near volcanic systems on the early Earth, thus contributing to the
   prebiotic chemical inventory of the primordial Earth.},

Abstract = {As part of a field campaign that studied the impact of Mexico City
   pollution plume at the local, sub-regional and regional levels, we
   studied transport-related changes in PM10 composition, oxidative
   potential and in vitro toxicological patterns (hemolysis, DNA
   degradation). We collected PM10 in Mexico City (T-0) and at a
   suburban-receptor site (T-1), pooled according to two observed
   ventilation patterns (T-0 -> T-1 influence and non-influence). T-0
   samples contained more Cu, Zn, and carbon whereas; T-1 samples contained
   more of Al, Si, P, S, and K (p < 0.05). Only SO4-2 increased in T-1
   during the influence periods. Oxidative potential correlated with Cu/Zn
   content Cr = 0.74; p < 0.05) but not with biological effects. T-1 PM10
   induced greater hemolysis and T-0 PM10 induced greater DNA degradation.
   Influence/non-influence did not affect oxidative potential nor
   biological effects. Results indicate that ventilation patterns had
   little effect on intrinsic PM10 composition and toxicological potential,
   which suggests a significant involvement of local sources. (C) 2011

Abstract = {The increasing market demand for cephalopods and the experiences

   their culture in Latin America. In 2008, an international workshop was
   held in Puerto Montt, Chile, with 14 experts in experimental cephalopods
   aquaculture from Brazil, Chile, Spain, and Mexico. Several topics were
   approached within the holobenthic species Octopus maya and the
   merobenthic species Enteroctopus megalocyathus, Octopus vulgaris, and
   Robsonella fontaniana. Part of the conclusions demonstrated that the two
   greatest difficulties for their production were survival of paralarvae
   for merobenthic species, and survival of early juveniles for holobenthic
   species. Besides, there is a need to study the endogenous and exogenous
   factors affecting health and nutritional status of embryos, paralarvae,
   and juveniles. These stages, which may limit the culture, should be
   extensively studied in order to develop the appropriate environmental
   conditions and culture systems for the physiological and behavioral
   requirements, from egg incubation up to juveniles to reach a grow-out
   phase.},

Abstract = {Flavonoids are a family of antioxidants that are widely represented in
   fruits, vegetables, dry legumes, and chocolate, as well as in popular
   beverages, such as red wine, coffee, and tea. The flavonoids chlorogenic
   acid, kaempferol, quercetin and quercetin 3 beta-D-glycoside were
   investigated for genotoxicity using the wing somatic mutation and
   recombination test (SMART). This test makes use of two recessive wing
   cell markers: multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare (flr(3)), which are
   mutations located on the left arm of chromosome 3 of Drosophila
   melanogaster and are indicative of both mitotic recombination and
   various types of mutational events. In order to test the antioxidant
   capacities of the flavonoids, experiments were conducted with various
   combinations of oxidants and polyphenols. Oxidative stress was induced
   using hydrogen peroxide, the Fenton reaction and paraquat. Third-instar
   transheterozygous larvae were chronically treated for all experiments.
   The data obtained in this study showed that, at the concentrations
   tested, the flavonoids did not induce somatic mutations or recombination
   in D. melanogaster with the exception of quercetin, which proved to be
   genotoxic at only one concentration. The oxidants hydrogen peroxide and
   the Fenton reaction did not induce mutations in the wing somatic assay
   of D. melanogaster, while paraquat and combinations of flavonoids
   produced significant numbers of small single spots. Quercetin 3
   beta-D-glycoside mixed with paraquat was shown to be desmutagenic.
   Combinations of the oxidants with the other flavonoids did not show any
   antioxidant activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the ideal Fermi gas a physical interpretation can be given to a
   curious ``hump{''} that develops in the chemical potential mu(T) as a
   function of absolute temperature T for any spatial dimensionality d < 2,
   integer or not. This contrasts with the more familiar monotonic decrease
   for d >= 2. The hump height increases without limit as d decreases
   toward zero where mu = +infinity. This positive divergence at d -> 0 is
   argued to be a clear manifestation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle in
   configuration space, whereby two spinless fermions cannot sit on top of
   each other. The observed hump is thus an obvious precursor of this
   manifestation, otherwise well understood, say, in the Is level of the H
   atom. The ideal Bose gas for d < 2 is also reexamined and found

Abstract = {The interaction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with biomolecules has been a
   subject of great interest during the last decades, for the wide range of
   applications profiting their novel properties; particularly, it has been
   pointed out their ability to interact with living cells for different
   purposes. The study of the interactions between CNTs and DNA is an
   active research subject, given the remarkable properties of the DNA
   molecule and its potential use in biologic materials. Theoretical
   calculations have become an essential task in the study of such
   interactions; hence, computational simulations provide a powerful tool,
   which in turn yields powerful insights on the underlying phenomena of
   nanoscale processes occurring on these composites. This work reviews
   some of the latest efforts on theoretical simulations of DNA
   functionalized CNTs composites. Among the different theoretical
   approaches used in computational modeling of nanocomposites there are
   some that were found not fitted for analyzing CNTs, given the large
   number of molecules present in an ordinary CNT; often these routines are
   very resource consuming and long computation times are frequently
   required for accurate analysis. Recent works using density functional
   theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) have proven to be of great
   value when dealing with DNA modified CNTs. We discuss some of the latest
   results of these treatments, namely, on the DNA insertion in and
   wrapping around single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and envision some
   of their current applications such as nanocarriers for therapeutical
   uses, selective imaging, and biological sensing. (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Title = {Mechanical paradox: the uphill roller},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1559-1576},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We analyse in detail the dynamics of a mechanical system which is a
   rigid body with the geometry of a double cone. This double cone is
   apparently able to spontaneously roll uphill along inclined rails. The
   experiment has been known for some centuries, and because of its
   peculiar behaviour, it has been named `mechanical paradox'. Although
   this instrument is well known today, we have not found in the literature
   a dynamical study like the one we are presenting. A deeper analysis of
   this mechanical object will allow us to go further than explaining the
   apparent paradox in the system; it will show interesting features of the
   dynamics that are not evident or intuitive. In this work, we follow a
   complete study of the geometry, the kinematic variables and the
   Lagrangian dynamics of the problem for any set of the angular parameters
   and initial values, and obtain as a result a full description of the
   dynamic variables of this mechanical device. In addition to studying the
   dynamics of the system with the angles that yield the typical
   paradoxical behaviour, we study carefully what we call the constant
   potential geometry regime, where the centre of mass maintains its
   height, and found in this particular case some features of the dynamics
   which are not common in rolling objects. We believe that this work can
   offer the student good material to review some fundamental concepts of
   analytical mechanics.},

Title = {Island evolutionary biogeography: analysis of the weevils (Coleoptera:

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim I analysed distributional and phylogenetic information on weevils
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from the Falklands, and integrated it with
   molecular, palaeontological and geological information to infer a
   geobiotic scenario.
   Location Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas).
   Methods The panbiogeographical analysis was based on data on 23 Falkland
   species and their related taxa from southern South America. For the
   cladistic biogeographical analysis I analysed six weevil taxa for which
   phylogenetic hypotheses are available (the generic groups Cylydrorhinus,
   Strangaliodes and Falklandius, and the genera Antarctobius,
   Germainiellus and Puranius). Results from this analysis were compared
   with previous regionalizations. Cenocrons (sets of taxa that share the
   same biogeographical history) were identified by considering temporal
   information provided by fossils and molecular clocks. Finally, a
   geobiotic scenario was proposed by integrating the available
   information.
   Results Six generalized tracks were detected: Maule-Valdivian forests,
   Magellanic forest, Magellanic moorland, Falkland Islands, Magellanic
   forest-Magellanic moorland, and Magellanic forest-Falkland Islands. A
   node was identified in the Magellanic forest, based on the overlap of
   two generalized tracks. A single general area cladogram was obtained,
   implying the following sequence: (Magellanic moorland (Maule-Valdivian
   forests (Magellanic forest, Falkland Islands))). The Falklands are
   classified here as a biogeographical province in the Austral realm,
   Andean region and Subantarctic subregion. Falkland weevils seem to
   belong to a single Subantarctic cenocron. The sequence of events deduced
   implies the following steps: development of the Subantarctic biota in
   southern South America, arrival of the Falkland crustal block from South
   Africa in the Early Cretaceous, geodispersal of the Subantarctic
   cenocron from southern South America to the Falklands during the Early
   Oligocene, vicariance of the Magellanic moorland, vicariance of the
   Maule-Valdivian forests, and final vicariance between the Magellanic
   forest and the Falkland Islands.
   Main conclusions The biotic components identified support the connection
   of the Falkland weevils with the Magellanic forest. Falkland weevils
   belong to a single cenocron, dated to at least the Early Oligocene, when
   geodispersal from southern South America may have occurred. An older
   African cenocron may have been replaced completely by the Subantarctic
   one when the proto-Falklands made contact with the Patagonian
   continental shelf. A geobiotic scenario implying vicariance events
   related to sea-level variations could explain the distributional
   patterns analysed herein.},

Abstract = {Given the current speed of land use change, we cannot expect to save all
   species from extinction, and so must decide how to focus limited
   resources to prevent the greatest number of extinctions. This paper
   proposes a simple conservation triage method that: evaluates the threat
   status for 145 micro-endemic Mexican amphibian species; assesses current
   potential threat abatement responses derived from existing policy
   instruments and social initiatives; and combines both indicators to
   provide broad-scale conservation strategies that would best suit
   amphibian micro-endemic buffered areas (AMBAs) in Mexico. To prioritize
   the AMBAs we used existing and newly compiled spatial databases of
   territorial conservation instruments, threats, and amphibian range
   distributions for Mexico. We identify 50\% of Mexican micro-endemic
   amphibians as requiring urgent actions. Based on the location of the
   AMBAs and using existing conservation instruments, we develop a
   conservation strategy for the majority of these species. However, almost
   25\% urgently need field-base verification to confirm their persistence
   due to the small percentage of remnant natural vegetation within the
   AMBAs, before we may sensibly recommend such a strategy. (C) 2011

   characterization was performed by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction

   group R3c, as well as recently suggested monoclinic symmetries, were
   assayed in the search for the best fit. Due to the ambiguity of the
   Rietveld refinement to distinguish between crystal systems, a
   micro-diffraction and HRTEM study has been performed. The best solution
   was obtained with the trigonal model. The room-temperature Mossbauer

Title = {CONTROLS ON LINKS BETWEEN GEOMORPHICAL AND SURFACE SEDIMENTOLOGICAL
   VARIABILITY: AITUTAKI AND MAUPITI ATOLLS, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN},

Abstract = {Isolated carbonate platforms and atolls occur throughout the geologic
   record, from Archean to present. Although the roles of sea-level change,
   tectonics, and sediment supply on large-scale changes in stratigraphical
   architecture of these systems are relatively well understood, the
   details of the nature and controls on sedimentological variability
   between and within individual geomorphic elements on platforms and
   atolls are less well constrained. The purposes of this study are (1) to
   describe, compare, and contrast geomorphological and sedimentological
   characteristics of surficial Holocene sediments from two south Pacific
   atolls (Aitutaki and Maupiti) representing different physical and
   chemical oceanographic settings, and (2) to explore possible causes for
   sedimentological heterogeneity by contrasting the patterns with those
   present on other platforms and regions.
   Both atolls include annular shelf-edge reef systems with a red algal rim
   and reef flat, flanked lagoonward by reef sand aprons up to 1,500 m
   wide. These aprons consist of moderately sorted coarse sand and gravel,
   with an abundance of Halimetia, coral, and red algal fragments; broadly,
   sediments become finer and better rounded away from margins. Water
   depths increase abruptly inboard of these reef sand aprons, into
   platform interiors with depths up to 25 m (Maupiti) and 9 m (Aitutaki).
   Although patch reefs dot these lagoons, sediment is commonly poorly
   sorted with bimodal and polymodal size distributions and includes a mix
   of whole and fragmented skeletal grains, peloids, and ooids; mud and
   fine sand are abundant (up to 80\% on Maupith, 85\% on Aitutaki).
   The occurrence of peloids, fine ooid sand, and oolitically laminated
   skeletal grains on Maupiti Atoll (as previously documented on Aitutaki)
   is consistent with interpretations of the impact of elevated regional
   ocean total alkalinity (TA) and pH levels in this part of the Pacific.
   On these wave-dominated atolls, open-ocean waves impinging on the
   platform margins generate currents that transport sediment from the
   reef, across the sand apron, and towards the platform interior. Unlike
   the tide-dominated platforms of the Bahamas, however, weak tides
   preclude strong daily agitation and circulation, so ooids do not grow
   large, and mud and fine sand transported into the atoll interiors is
   sequestered there. In the interiors, both sediment produced in situ and
   fine allochthonous sediment are more influenced by biological processes
   than by physical transport processes, so bioturbated muddy sand is most
   common. Collectively, the comparative analysis provides actualistic,
   process-based conceptual models for the nature and controls on
   variability of shelf-margin reef and reef apron systems and platform
   interiors, within and among atolls.},

Abstract = {We undertook a panbiogeographic analysis of the broad-nosed weevils of
   the genera Naupactus Dejean, 1821, Pantomorus Schonherr, 1840 and
   Phacepholis Horn, 1876 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from North and
   Central America to propose a biogeographic scenario to explain their
   biotic diversification. Based on individual tracks of 30 species, we
   obtained six generalized tracks: Mesoamerican, Chiapas, Sierra Madre del
   Sur, Mexican Pacific Coast, Southern Great Plains and Northern Great
   Plains tracks. The Sierra Madre del Sur generalized track is the best
   supported, based on 10 species of the three genera. We found two nodes,
   one at the intersection of the Mesoamerican and Chiapas tracks, and
   another at the intersection of the Chiapas and Sierra Madre del Sur
   tracks. Species of Naupactus are primarily distributed in lowlands,
   associated mostly with dry forests and xeric environments. Species of
   Pantomorus and Phacepholis would have diversified from South American
   Naupactus-like ancestors, mainly in montane habitats and lowlands of
   North and Central America, between sea level to about 2500 m of
   altitude.},

Abstract = {Islands have long-attracted scientists because of their relatively
   simple biotas and stark geographic boundaries. However, for many islands
   and archipelagos, this simplicity may be overstated because of
   methodological and conceptual limitations when these biotas were
   described. One archipelago that has received relatively little recent
   attention is the Philippine islands. Although much of its biota was
   documented long ago, taxonomic revision and evolutionary study has been
   surprisingly scarce, and only a few molecular phylogenetic studies are
   beginning to appear. We present a molecular phylogeny and taxonomic
   revision for the Philippine fantails (Ayes: Rhipidura) using nuclear and
   mitochondrial DNA sequences. Our results suggest that current taxonomy
   underestimates diversity in the group. Some morphologically distinct
   subspecies warrant species status, whereas one was indistinguishable
   genetically and morphologically and should not be retained. A few taxa
   require additional sampling for thorough taxonomic assessment. Patterns
   of diversity within Philippine Rhipidura mostly corroborate predictions
   of the Pleistocene aggregate island complex (PAIC) hypothesis, in which
   diversity is expected to be partitioned by deep water channels
   separating Pleistocene aggregate islands rather than by current islands.
   Substantial structure within PAIC clades indicates that additional
   drivers of diversification should be considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The immune mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe pneumonia
   associated with the A/H1N1 virus are not well known. The objective of
   this study was to determine whether severe A/H1N1-associated pneumonia
   can be explained by the emergence of particular T-cell subsets and the
   cytokines/chemokines they produced, as well as distinct responses to
   infection. T-cell subset distribution and cytokine/chemokine levels in
   peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were determined in
   patients with severe A/H1N1 infection, asymptomatic household contacts,
   and healthy controls. Cytokine and chemokine production was also
   evaluated after in vitro infection with seasonal H1N1 and pandemic
   A/H1N1 strains. We found an increase in the frequency of peripheral Th2
   and Tc2 cells in A/H1N1 patients. A trend toward increased Tc1 cells was
   observed in household contacts. Elevated serum levels of IL-6, CXCL8,
   and CCL2 were found in patients and a similar cytokine/chemokine profile
   was observed in BAL, in which CCL5 was also increased. Infection assays
   revealed that both strains induce the production of several
   cytokines/chemokines at 24 and 72 h, however, IL-6, CCL3, and CXCL8 were
   strongly up-regulated in 72-h cultures in presence of the A/H1N1 virus.
   Several inflammatory mediators are up-regulated in peripheral and lung
   samples from A/H1N1-infected patients who developed severe pneumonia. In
   addition, the A/H1N1 strain induces higher levels of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines and chemokines than the seasonal H1N1 strain. These findings
   suggest that it is possible to identify biomarkers of severe pneumonia
   and also suggest the therapeutic use of immunomodulatory drugs in
   patients with severe pneumonia associated with A/H1N1 infection.},

Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {A detailed numerical simulation is carried out for transient laminar
   flow opposing mixed convection in a downward vertical channel flow with
   both walls suddenly subjected to isothermal heat sources over a finite
   portion of the channel walls, by solving the unsteady two-dimensional
   Navier-Stokes and energy equations. The dynamical behavior of the system
   is influenced by, in addition to the geometrical parameters, three
   nondimensional parameters: the Reynolds, Richardson, and Prandtl
   numbers. Numerical experiments were performed for fixed values of the
   geometrical parameters, the Reynolds number (Re = 100) and the Prandtl
   number (Pr = 7). With variation in the value of the buoyancy (Richardson
   number), the nonlinear dynamical response of the system can reach (i) a
   stationary solution, (ii) a local and then a global periodic solution
   where the system executes self-sustained relaxation oscillations, or
   (iii) a solution in which the relaxation oscillation is destroyed
   leading to a chaotic state. In this study, bifurcations between
   different states, phase-space plots of the self-oscillatory system,
   characteristic times of temperature oscillations, and an exact
   description of the oscillations are presented quantitatively for a range
   of values of the buoyancy parameter. The results include the effects of
   the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers on the evolution of the different
   transitions.},

   relationship},

Abstract = {The results from various studies have indicated possible functional
   relationships between crayfish electroretinogram (ERG) rhythmic
   amplitude changes and the serotonergic pathways projecting from the
   central brain through the optic neuropils to the eye, but to date, this
   functional interaction has not been proven. Here, in a set of
   experiments using an isolated eyestalk-brain preparation, we
   investigated whether there is a circadian input from the brain to retina
   that regulates this rhythm. We sought to determine whether the
   protocerebral bridge (PB) stimulation affects the ERG amplitude in
   accordance with the zeitgeber time (ZT) and whether 5-HT modulates the
   associate input. Our results showed that photic stimulation of retina
   produced changes in both the amplitude and the frequency of spontaneous
   electrical activity in the protocerebral neuropils. In addition,
   electrical stimulation of the medial protocerebrum, particularly the PB,
   produced statistically significant changes in the ERG that depended on
   both the time of day and the level of serotonin. This suggests that
   pathways between retina and PB seem to be serotonergic. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Species from the Ternstroemiaceae family are commonly used in Mexican
   traditional medicine prepared as infusion or decoction. In the present
   study, aqueous extracts obtained from the flowers, fruits, and seeds of
   Ternstroemia genera and fruits of two species of Cleyera genera were
   evaluated for flavonoid presence by planar chromatography using NP-PEG
   reagent, standards (kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin), and subsequent
   plate analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by using a
   1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-generating system, whereas
   anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by using the
   12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear inflammation
   model in mice. The thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) fingerprint analysis
   of extracts evidenced that all samples evaluated contain flavonoids;
   intensity of the spots were slightly higher in extracts obtained by
   infusion. Video Scan software analysis of the derivatized TLC plate
   showed the presence of quercetin on the majority of samples; this was
   not the case for rutin and kaempferol, which appeared in few samples.
   All extracts evaluated exhibited antioxidant activity; the most active
   were those obtained from plants of the Cleyera genus with an effective
   concentration (EC50) = 1 and 12 ppm for C. integrifolia and C.
   theaeoides, respectively. Regarding the anti-inflammatory activity, the
   aqueous extracts from T tepezapote, C. integrifolia, and C. theaeoides
   at a 1 mg per ear dosage showed a similar response to 0.1 mg per ear of
   indomethacin. Samples activity increased when heat was involved in the
   preparation of the extract. Presence of flavonoids after planar
   chromatography analysis suggests that these constituents are partially
   responsible for the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of the
   active extracts. The purpose of this study was to recognize the presence
   of flavonoids by means of TLC and VideoScan analyses, which are both
   quick and reliable methods that serve also to verify differences between
   the samples.},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {The Jico crested-tailed mouse (Habromys simulatus) is an arboreal rodent
   endemic to Mexico, with only 2 known extant populations restricted to
   montane cloud forests in the states of Hidalgo and Oaxaca. The habitat
   of this species has been reduced and fragmented as a result of
   anthropogenic activities, isolating populations and likely decreasing
   their sizes. We evaluated the effects of such isolation by analyzing the
   genetic diversity and structure of H. simulatus using 10 microsatellite
   loci. DNA was obtained from 52 samples from both populations. Despite
   the isolated and fragmented nature of the species, we found high levels
   of genetic diversity (H-Nei = 0.732), similar to those reported in other
   endangered species with fragmented distributions. Genetic
   differentiation was significant (F-ST = 0.178) and number of migrants
   was negligible (NmF(ST) = 0.196), a result supported by an assignment
   test and a factorial correspondence test. Molecular analysis of variance
   showed that 82\% of genetic variation was distributed within
   populations, not unexpected given that each of the individuals'
   genotypes was distinct. Individuals within each population were mostly
   unrelated. The smallest population showed evidence of genetic
   bottleneck. We found evidence of detrimental genetic processes such as
   allelic fixation, genetic drift, and inbreeding. Our results strongly
   suggest that each of the 2 populations is a unique genetic entity that
   must be considered a distinct evolutionary unit. Unfortunately, both
   populations are at high risk of extinction, primarily due to habitat
   loss and population decline.},

Title = {Patterns of genetic diversity in the critically endangered Central
   American river turtle: human influence since the Mayan age?},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {We conducted a phylogeographic analysis of the strictly aquatic and
   critically endangered Central American river turtle, Dermatemys mawii,
   as part of a conservation management program for the species. We sampled
   238 individuals from 15 different localities throughout the species
   range. Using sequence fragments from the mtDNA Cyt b and ND4 genes, we
   identified 16 different haplotypes. Overall, our results reveal a signal
   of phylogeographic structure throughout the range, which appears to have
   been secondarily blurred by extensive gene flow. Notably, this also
   applies to genetic structuring across three major hydrological basins
   that pose biogeographic breaks in other aquatic taxa. Divergence times
   of mtDNA haplotypes in D. mawii suggest that the main lineages split in
   the Pliocene-Pleistocene (3.73-0.227 MA) and demographic tests indicate
   that the species has undergone drastic demographic size fluctuations
   since this time period. One ancient haplotype (1D) was found to exhibit
   sequence divergence of up to 2\% from other haplogroups. Divergence of
   this magnitude is indicative of species level differentiation in other
   turtle genera. Haplotype 1D was found in only two localities, Sarstun
   and Salinas, but specimens with other haplotypes were also found in
   those localities. It is not known whether the individuals with the 1D
   haplotype interbreed with non-1D individuals. Our results suggest that
   human activity, such as harvesting and long distance transport of
   animals, may have influenced the current patterns of genetic diversity.
   For more than 2000 years, D. mawii has been consumed by people from
   Middle American cultures, and the archeological record contains strong
   evidence that the Mayans transported animals between villages and far
   away from their natural distribution range. Therefore, the large-scale
   pattern of haplotype sharing even across hydrological barriers, the
   observed low haplotype diversity in some populations and the
   contemporary absence of a pronounced phylogeographic pattern is likely
   due to a combination of population expansions, gene flow, extensive
   human-mediated-movements and recent bottlenecks resulting from
   over-harvesting.},

Abstract = {Sceloporus bicanthalis is a viviparous lizard that lives at higher
   elevations in Mexico. Adult male S. bicanthalis were collected (n = 36)
   from the Nevado de Toluca, Mexico (elevation is 4200 m) during August to
   December, 2007 and January to July, 2008. Testes were extracted, fixed
   in Trumps, and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Tissues were
   embedded, sectioned (2 gm), stained, and examined via a light microscope
   to determine the spermatogenic developmental strategy of S. bicanthalis.
   In all months examined, the testes were spermiogenically active; based
   on this, plus the presence of sperm in the lumina of seminiferous
   tubules, we inferred that S. bicanthalis had year-round or continuous
   spermatogenesis, unlike most reptiles that occupy a temperate or montane
   habitat. It was recently reported that seasonally breeding reptiles had
   a temporal germ cell development strategy similar to amphibians, where
   germ cells progress through spermatogenesis as a single population,
   which leads to a single spermiation event. This was much different than
   spatial development within the testis of other derived amniotes. We
   hypothesized that germ cell development was temporal in S. bicanthalis.
   Therefore, we wanted to determine whether reptiles that practice
   continuous spermatogenesis have a mammalian-like spatial germ cell
   development, which is different than the typical temperate reptile
   exhibiting a temporal development. In the present study, S. bicanthalis
   had a temporal development strategy, despite its continuous
   spermatogenic cycle, making them similar to tropical anoles. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a global emergency. The World Health Organization
   reports about 9.2 million new infections each year, with an average of
   1.7 million people killed by the disease. The causative agent is
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), whose main target are the macrophages,
   important immune system cells. Macrophages and T cell populations are
   the main responsible for fighting the pathogen. A better understanding
   of the interaction between Mtb, macrophages and T cells will contribute
   to the design of strategies to control TB. The purpose of this study is
   to evaluate the impact of the response of T cells and macrophages in the
   control of Mtb. To this end, we propose a system of ordinary
   differential equations to model the interaction among non-infected
   macrophages, infected macrophages, T cells and Mtb bacilli. Model
   analysis reveals the existence of two equilibrium states, infection-free
   equilibrium and the endemically infected equilibrium which can represent
   a state of latent or active infection, depending on the amount of
   bacteria.},

Abstract = {Induced spawning of common snook, Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch, 1792)
   and scale-up of larval rearing is described. Fertilized eggs were
   obtained from sGnRHa induced broodstock, acclimatized to captivity under
   natural conditions, for 5 years in 12-m(3) fiberglass tanks. Females
   with 402 +/- 15 mu m diameter vitellogenic oocytes were given an implant
   dose of 121 +/- 31 mu g kg(-1) while males received 83 +/- 6 mu g
   kg(-1). A total of 433 x 10(6) eggs (18.5\% floating) resulted from ten
   natural voluntary spawns. Two 5-m(3) cylindrical fiberglass tanks were
   stocked at an average of 40 floating eggs l(-1), which resulted in 14
   larvae l(-1) at 2 days post hatch (dph). A total of 70,936 juveniles
   were harvested on 45 dph (50.7\% survival from first feeding). Two
   critical periods occurred, between 1 and 2 dph, and during
   transformation (20-23 dph). Final mean total length and weight at 46 dph
   were 21.26 +/- 2.83 mm (0.42 mm day(-1)) and 0.07 +/- 0.03 g (0.002 g
   day(-1)). Mean final density and biomass were 7.1 juveniles l(-1) and
   0.479 kg m(-3). The incidence of deformities was low, less than 2\%,
   mostly lordosis. Improvements for spawning common snook including
   changes in feeding regime and GnRHa implant doses are detailed along
   with suggestions for further improvements in mass production technology.

Title = {Genetic variation in a female genital trait evolved by sexual
   coevolution},
Journal = {GENETICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {139},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1241-1249},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding the patterns of genetic variation of traits subject to
   sexual selection is fundamental for explaining its evolutionary dynamics
   and potential for sexual coevolution. The signa of female Lepidoptera
   are sclerotized structures located on the inner surface of the genital
   receptacle that receives the spermatophore during copulation (the corpus
   bursae), whose main function is tearing the spermatophore envelope.
   Comparative data indicate that the evolution of signa has been
   influenced by sexually antagonistic coevolution with spermatophore
   envelopes. We looked for additive genetic variation in the size and
   shape of signa in females of the butterfly Callophrys xami (Lycaenidae)
   from two localities (BG and FC) in Mexico City. We also looked for
   genetic variation in female body size and in the size of corpus bursae.
   There were significant between-population differences in female body
   size, signa width and three signa shape traits. We found significant
   extranuclear maternal effects in one component of signa shape in the BG
   population, and in body weight, signa length and in one uniform
   component of signa shape in the FC population. Extranuclear maternal
   contributions could permit the evolution of female adaptations even if
   these reduce male fitness. We found additive genetic variation in signa
   length and width only in one population (BG); heritability estimates
   were high: 0.96 and 0.8, respectively. The existence of additive genetic
   variation in signa size could be, at least in part, a result of relaxed
   sexually antagonistic selection pressures due to the low level of
   polyandry exhibited by this species. Our results imply that there is
   currently potential for further sexual coevolution in this trait.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {The structure, mineralogy, and accretion processes of the modern and
   subfossil cyanobacterial microbialites from the alkaline crater lake
   Alchichica (Puebla, Mexico) were studied, along the lake's bathymetry
   and hydrochemistry. The recent lowering of the lake level had exposed
   microbialitic carbonate mounds and crusts, which emerged up to 2 m above
   the water surface, while accreting cyanobacterial microbialites were
   present down to a depth of similar to 15 m. Morphological and molecular
   analysis found that the living cyanobacterial mats were composed of
   diverse filamentous and coccoid cyanobacteria (Nostocales,
   Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Pleurocapsales). The emerged
   subfossil microbialites comprised two generations: ``white{''} (domes
   and crusts composed mainly of hydromagnesite with an admixture of
   huntite and calcite, U-238/Th-230 age of similar to 2.8 ka BP), and
   ``brown{''} (chimneys, columns and laminated crusts composed of
   aragonite with an admixture of Mg-calcite, U-238/Th-230 age of similar
   to 1.1 ka BP). The significant age, structural, mineralogical, and
   isotopic differences suggest that the two generations were formed in
   different environmental conditions: the ``white{''} during a dry period,
   and the ``brown{''} in wet climate associated with high water level and
   intense inflow of ground water, which lowered the Mg/Ca ratio resulting
   in formation of aragonite instead of hydromagnesite. The hydromagnesite,
   replacing the primary aragonite precipitated in the living
   cyanobacterial biofilm, frequently undergoes silicification, which
   obliterates both the primary structure of the carbonate and the enclosed
   remains of cyanobacterial microbiota. This process helps to explain the
   abundant formation of dolomites and cherts in an allegedly highly
   alkaline Early Precambrian ocean. Thus, Lake Alchichica represents a
   modern alkaline environment where biosedimentary structures resembling
   Precambrian deposits are generated.},

Abstract = {Hexagonal mesostructured films containing silver ions were obtained by

   nanoparticles was determined by infrared spectroscopy and optical
   absorption. Besides, these nanoparticles and core-shell structures of
   silver-silver oxide nanoparticles were identified by high-resolution
   transmission electronic microscopy. From these measurements, the
   obtained size range for silver nanoparticles was 6.1 nm. The absorption
   spectrum located at 440 nm was modelled and well fitted with the Gans
   theory considering refractive index higher than the one coming from host
   matrix. This index is explained because the silver oxide shell modifies
   the local surrounding medium of the metallic nanoparticles.},

Title = {Numerical solution of the Boussinesq equation: Application to the

Abstract = {Water flow to subterranean drains is described by the Boussinesq
   equation. To solve this equation, analytical solutions comprising
   constants, such as the transmissivity and drainable porosity have been
   developed; however, these solutions assume that free surface of the
   water falls instantly over the drains. The aim of this investigation is
   to present a finite difference solution of the differential equation
   using a drainable porosity variable and a fractal radiation condition.
   Here, two schemes are presented: the first one, with an explicit head
   and drainable porosity, both joined by a functional relationship, called
   mixed formulation; and the second one, called head formulation, with
   only the head. By using a lineal analytical solution, both methods have
   been validated and the nonlinear part was stable and brief. The proposed
   numerical solution is useful for the hydraulic characterization of soils
   with inverse modelation and to improve the designs of agricultural
   drainage systems, when taking into consideration that the assumptions of
   the classical solution have been eliminated. To evaluate the descriptive
   capacity of the numerical solution, these solutions were used to
   describe a drainage experiment performed in the laboratory. The results
   show that the cumulative drained depth is well represented by these
   solutions with the fractal radiation and the variable drainable
   porosity.},

Journal = {CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {28},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {A major problem in the quantization of fields in curved spacetimes is
   the ambiguity in the choice of a Fock representation for the canonical
   commutation relations. There exists infinite number of choices leading
   to different physical predictions. In stationary scenarios, a common
   strategy is to select a vacuum (or a family of unitarily equivalent
   vacua) by requiring invariance under the spacetime symmetries. When
   stationarity is lost, a natural generalization consists in replacing
   time invariance by unitarity in the evolution. We prove that when the
   spatial sections are compact, the criterion of a unitary dynamics,
   together with the invariance under the spatial isometries, suffices to
   select a unique family of Fock quantizations for a scalar field with
   time-dependent mass.},

Title = {Inhibition of gluconeogenesis by Malmea depressa root},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1},
Pages = {930-933},

Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Malmea depressa is traditionally used in
   the Mayan communities of southeastern Mexico to treat type 2 diabetes. A
   root bark infusion is being taken throughout the day, between meals.
   Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to determine whether an
   ethanolic extract of Malmea depressa would reduce hepatic glucose
   production by targeting gluconeogenesis. The effects of the plant
   extract on gluconeogenesis (in vivo) and the activity of GL-6-P (in
   vitro) were examined.
   Materials and methods: The plant extract was analyzed by HPLC to confirm
   its phytochemical composition. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis was
   tested in vivo by performing a pyruvate tolerance test in n5-STZ after
   an 18-h fasting period. The extracts effect on glucose-6-phosphatase
   activity were assayed in vitro with intact rat liver microsomes.
   Results: Using HPLC-DAD we confirmed that the phytochemical compositions
   of the tested extract were similar to those previously reported. We
   proved that the ethanolic extract of the root bark of Malmea depressa
   dose-dependently inhibits a glucose peak. Furthermore, the
   gluconeogenesis inhibition was confirmed in vitro using a pyruvate test.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that administration of Malmea depressa
   can improve glycemic control by blocking hepatic glucose production,
   especially in the fasting state. These data support its traditional use
   as an infusion consumed continually throughout the day. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Let W = (W-i)(i is an element of N) he an infinite dimensional Brownian

   R-n-valued deterministic differentiable curve and R-t > 0, t > 0 a

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Chinampas are raised garden beds used for agriculture in the valley of
   Mexico since pre-Hispanic times. Large amounts of methylparathion, i.e.
   approximately 0.5 kg ha(-1) per crop cycle, are used to control pests
   with an unknown effect on soil processes, such as the denitrification
   process. Soil was amended with nitrate (NO3-) with or without
   chloramphenicol known to inhibit de novo synthesis of enzymes, with or
   without acetylene (C2H2) known to inhibit the reduction of nitrous oxide
   (N2O) to dinitrogen (N-2) and spiked with or without methylparathion.
   Methylparathion increased the N2O and N-2 emissions, the NO2-
   concentration and removal of NO3- from soil. The NO2- concentration in
   the anaerobic incubation was larger when soil was conditioned
   aerobically <7 days compared to soil conditioned for >7 days, but no
   such pattern was observed for the removal of NO3-. C2H2 and/or
   chloramphenicol had no significant effect on NO3- removal and the NO2-
   concentration in the methylparathion-amended soil, but increased the
   NO2- concentration in unamended soil with C2H2 plus chloramphenicol
   compared to the other treatments. C2H2 increased the N2O emission in
   soil amended with or without methylparathion and with or without
   chloramphenicol. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Number = {6},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Patterns were generated inside a horizontal cylinder rotating at low
   speeds. The cylinder was filled with a very low volume liquid fraction
   of 1.8\% of Newtonian fluid and the rotation speed ranged between 0.08
   and 5.2 s(-1). A novel laser-plane technique was utilized to obtain time
   series from each pattern. This enabled the characterization of fluid
   patterns using Fourier spectral (FS) and dynamical-systems (chaotic)
   techniques such as the recurrence map, correlation dimension (D-2) and
   Hurst exponent (H). Four patterns were found (fingers, furrows,
   waterfall and smooth tooth) before annular flow was reached. The results
   indicate that the FS technique not is suitable for flow pattern
   characterization; and H only has the ability to indicate a possible
   pattern change. The best tool for indicating the pattern transitions and
   the inner coat liquid evolution was found to be recurrence maps and D-2.

   beta-D-glucopyranoside starting from diosgenin is described. This

   cervicouterine cancer cell lines and human lymphocytes indicate that the
   main cell death process is not necrosis; hence it is not cytotoxic. The
   title compound induced apoptosis in cervicouterine cancer cells.
   Importantly, the antiproliferative activity on tumor cells did not
   affect the proliferative potential of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The
   title compound showed selective antitumor activity and greater
   antiproliferative activity than its aglycon, and therefore serves as a
   promising lead candidate for further optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {The motion of a falling drop whose mass grows by accretion is studied
   with Newtonian methods to the point of finding the position as a
   function of time. The equation of motion applied is the equation of
   motion of continuum mechanics in its Eulerian or space formulation. We
   study three examples of laws of accretion: mass growing linearly with
   time, mass growing linearly with the surface of the drop and mass
   growing proportionally to the product of surface and velocity. These
   examples are sometimes left as exercises, without further discussion,
   asking only for nu(z), or the final velocity. We also show that the
   solutions have the correct limit of a particle of constant mass in free
   fall and of such a particle with friction linear in the velocity.},

Abstract = {Vegetation and environment change mutually during secondary succession,
   yet the idiosyncrasies of the vegetation effect on the understorey
   environment are poorly understood. To test whether the successional
   understorey environment changes predictably and is shaped by the
   structure and seasonality of tropical dry forests, we estimated basal
   area and vegetation cover, and measured understorey temperature, light
   and moisture conditions, in 17 plots forming a 60-y chronosequence and a
   mature forest. Light and air and soil temperature decreased with time
   (75-15\% of open-sky radiation, 31.7-29.3 degrees C, and +2.5 degrees C
   to -0.5 degrees C relative to ambient, respectively), whereas relative
   humidity increased (67-74\%). Soil water availability increased with
   early-successional development (-45 to -1 kPa) but decreased afterwards
   (to-18 kPa). The first axis of a PCA of the rainy-season environment
   explained 60\% of the variation and was strongly related to air
   temperature and relative humidity. During tropical dry-forest
   succession, such factors may be more important than light, the reduction
   in which is not extreme compared with taller and more vertically
   stratified wet forests. Seasonality significantly affected the
   successional environmental gradients, which were marked mainly during
   the wet season. Environmental heterogeneity was higher in the wet than
   in the dry season, and larger for resources (light and water) than for
   conditions (temperature and humidity). The wet-season increase in
   environmental heterogeneity potentially creates differential growing
   scenarios; the environmental harshness of the dry season would mostly
   challenge seedling survival.},

Title = {Combining geostatistical models and remotely sensed data to improve
   tropical tree richness mapping},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Information on the spatial distribution and composition of biological
   communities is essential in designing effective strategies for
   biodiversity conservation and management. Reliable maps of species
   richness across the landscape can be useful tools for these purposes.
   Acquiring such information through traditional survey techniques is
   costly and logistically difficult. The kriging interpolation method has
   been widely used as an alternative to predict spatial distributions of
   species richness, as long as the data are spatially dependent. However,
   even when this requirement is met, researchers often have few sampled
   sites in relation to the area to be mapped. Remote sensing provides an
   inexpensive means to derive complete spatial coverage for large areas
   and can be extremely useful for estimating biodiversity. The aim of this
   study was to combine remotely sensed data with kriging estimates (hybrid
   procedures) to evaluate the possibility of improving the accuracy of
   tree species richness maps. We did this through the comparison of the
   predictive performance of three hybrid geostatistical procedures, based
   on tree species density recorded in 141 sampling quadrats: co-kriging
   (COK), kriging with external drift (KED), and regression kriging (RK).
   Reflectance values of spectral bands, computed NDVI and texture
   measurements of Landsat 7 TM imagery were used as ancillary variables in
   all methods. The R-2 values of the models increased from 0.35 for
   ordinary kriging to 0.41 for COK, and from 0.39 for simple regression
   estimates to 0.52 and 0.53 when using simple KED and RK, respectively.
   The R-2 values of the models also increased from 0.60 for multiple
   regression estimates to 0.62 and 0.66 when using multiple KED and RK,
   respectively. Overall, our results demonstrate that these procedures are
   capable of greatly improving estimation accuracy, with multivariate RK
   being clearly superior, because it produces the most accurate
   predictions, and because of its flexibility in modeling multivariate
   relationships between tree richness and remotely sensed data. We
   conclude that this is a valuable tool for guiding future efforts aimed
   at conservation and management of highly diverse tropical forests. (C)

Title = {Individual Canopy-tree Species Effects on Their Immediate Understory

Abstract = {Canopy trees are largely responsible for the environmental heterogeneity
   in the understory of tropical and subtropical species-rich forests,
   which in turn may influence sapling community dynamics. We tested the
   effect of the specific identity of four cloud forest canopy trees on
   total solar radiation, canopy openness, soil moisture, litter depth, and
   soil temperature, as well as on the structure and dynamics of the
   sapling community growing beneath their canopies. We observed
   significant effects of the specific identity of canopy trees on most
   understory microenvironmental variables. Soil moisture was higher and
   canopy openness lower beneath Cornus disciflora. In turn, canopy
   openness and total solar radiation were higher beneath Oreopanax
   xalapensis, while the lowest soil moisture occurred beneath Quercus
   laurina. Moreover, Chiranthodendron pentadactylon was the only species
   having a positive effect on litter depth under its canopy. In spite of
   these between-species environmental differences, only C. pentadactylon
   had significant, negative effects on sapling density and species
   richness, which may be associated to low seed germination and seedling
   establishment due to an increased litter depth in its vicinity. The
   relevance of the specific identity of canopy trees for natural
   regeneration processes and species richness maintenance depends on its
   potential to differentially affect sapling dynamics through
   species-specific modifications of microenvironmental conditions.},

Abstract = {The structural and magnetic properties of the small binary clusters
   FemYn (with m+n = 7, Y = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt) were studied through extensive
   ab initio calculations, by means of the fully unconstrained version of
   the density-functional method, as implemented in the SIESTA code, within
   the generalized gradient approximation. The lowest energy state
   geometries, the chemical ordering, and the electronic and the magnetic
   structures were calculated. We found that the lowest energy geometrical
   structures for the pure Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Fe heptamers, are a cube
   without an apex, a triangular prism capped on a square face, a
   decahedron, a side capped double square, and a decahedron, respectively.
   Starting from these geometries of the pure element heptamers, we
   followed the changes in the geometric structure as a function of the
   chemical composition. We analyzed all the different chemical
   arrangements, which depend on the particular geometry, and magnetic
   moment orientations, in the whole range of compositions. In general,
   there are important modifications to the magnetic moment of the Y atoms
   as soon as one of them is substituted by an Fe atom in the cluster. In
   contrast, under the same circumstances, the Fe magnetic moment takes
   values larger than 3 mu(B) and keeps almost this value, insensitive to
   the structure, composition and chemical order of the system.},

Abstract = {A new species of the colubrid genus Geophis is described from the Sierra
   Madre del Sur of Guerrero, Mexico. The new species possesses all of the
   diagnostic characters of the sieboldi group, but differs from all of the
   other species in the group by having dorsal scales arranged in 17 rows,
   133-139 ventrals in females and 130-137 in males, 24-31 subcaudals in
   females and 34-39 in males, keeled dorsal scales on at least the
   posterior three-fourths of the body, apparently no apical pits, and a
   light nuchal collar in juveniles. The new species fills a gap in the
   distribution of the sieboldi group between Michoacan and Oaxaca, and is
   the first Mexican species of the genus reported to exhibit both a
   unicolor (uniformly dark) and a bicolor (with dark markings on a red
   background color) body and tail dorsal patterns, a polymorphism similar
   to that previously documented in few lower Central American species.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by exaggerated
   fibroblast proliferation and accumulation of collagens and fibronectin.
   The extracellular fibronectin and collagen network is regulated by von
   Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). However, it is unknown whether pVHL
   contributes to pulmonary fibrosis. We found that lungs from patients
   with IPF expressed increased levels of pVHL in fibroblastic foci.
   Bleomycin treatment also induced pVHL in lung fibroblasts, but not in
   alveolar type II cells. Overexpression of pVHL increased lung fibroblast
   proliferation, protein abundance of fibronectin and collagen, and
   extracellular fibronectin. In addition, overexpression of pVHL induced
   expression of the alpha 5 integrin subunit. Overexpression of pVHL did
   not alter hypoxia-inducible factor luciferase reporter activity and mRNA
   expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Fibroblasts
   overexpressing pVHL were more sensitive to RGD peptide-mediated
   reduction in proliferation. Activating alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin
   increased proliferation of fibroblasts overexpressing pVHL and those
   cells were more resistant to the inhibition of alpha 5 integrin.
   Overexpression of pVHL also increased activation of focal adhesion
   kinase (FAK). Moreover, suppression of pVHL prevented TGF-beta 1-induced
   proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, our
   results indicate that elevated expression of pVHL results in the
   aberrant fibronectin expression, activation of integrin/FAK signaling,
   fibroblast proliferation, and fibrosis.-Zhou, Q., Pardo, A., Konigshoff,

Title = {The Evolution of a Female Genital Trait Widely Distributed in the
   Lepidoptera: Comparative Evidence for an Effect of Sexual Coevolution},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Background: Sexual coevolution is considered responsible for the
   evolution of many male genital traits, but its effect on female genital
   morphology is poorly understood. In many lepidopterans, females become
   temporarily unreceptive after mating and the length of this refractory
   period is inversely related to the amount of spermatophore remaining in
   their genital tracts. Sperm competition can select for males that delay
   female remating by transferring spermatophores with thick spermatophore
   envelopes that take more time to be broken. These envelopes could select
   for signa, sclerotized sharp structures located within the female
   genital tract, that are used for breaking spermatophores. Thus, this
   hypothesis predicts that thick spermatophore envelopes and signa evolve
   in polyandrous species, and that these adaptations are lost when
   monandry evolves subsequently. Here we test the expected associations
   between female mating pattern and presence/absence of signa, and review
   the scant information available on the thickness of spermatophore
   envelopes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We made a literature review and found
   information on female mating pattern (monandry/polyandry),
   presence/absence of signa and phylogenetic position for 37 taxa. We
   built a phylogenetic supertree for these taxa, mapped both traits on it,
   and tested for the predicted association by using Pagel's test for
   correlated evolution. We found that, as predicted by our hypothesis,
   monandry evolved eight times and in five of them signa were lost;
   preliminary evidence suggests that at least in two of the three
   exceptions males imposed monandry on females by means of specially thick
   spermatophore envelopes. Previously published data on six genera of
   Papilionidae is in agreement with the predicted associations between
   mating pattern and the characteristics of spermatophore envelopes and
   signa.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results support the hypothesis that signa
   are a product of sexually antagonistic coevolution with spermatophore
   envelopes.},

   fluctuation-dissipation relation, this mean-field ``temperature{''} can
   be used to describe a nonequilibrium system as is if it were in thermal
   equilibrium with a thermal bath at the mean-field ``temperature{''}
   mentioned above. We apply our results to chemical reactions in the
   presence of external forces showing how chemical equilibrium and Kramers
   rate constants are modified by the presence of these forces.},

Abstract = {The present atlas documents the morphology of representative species of
   22 tetragnathid genera, with emphasis on nontetragnathines. It includes
   approximately 960 scanning electron micrographs, morphological drawings
   and web photographs. The 213 characters used in the phylogenetic
   analyses are described and illustrated. We discuss the optimal
   cladograms obtained by the analysis of the morphological and behavioural
   data, and compare our results to a recent hypothesis of tetragnathid
   phylogenetic relationships that combined similar data with multigene DNA
   sequences. Based on the cladistic hypothesis that results from the total
   evidence analysis, we study the evolution of six morphological character
   systems within Tetragnathidae: spinneret spigots, respiratory
   structures, trichobothria, chelicerae, and male and female genitalia.

Title = {Phylogeography of Middle American gophersnakes: mixed responses to
   biogeographical barriers across the Mexican Transition Zone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1570-1584},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aim We used inferences of phylogeographical structure and estimates of
   divergence times for three species of gophersnakes (Colubridae:
   Pituophis) distributed across the Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ) to
   evaluate the postulated association of three Neogene geological events
   (marine seaway inundation of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, formation of
   the Transvolcanic Belt across central Mexico, and secondary uplifting of
   the Sierra Madre Occidental) and of Pleistocene climate change with
   inter-and intraspecific diversification.
   Location Mexico, Guatemala, and the western United States.
   Methods We combined range-wide sampling (67 individuals representing
   three putative species distributed across northern Middle America and
   western North America) and phylogenetic analyses of 1637 base pairs of
   mitochondrial DNA to estimate genealogical relationships and divergence
   times. The hypothesized concordance of inferred gene trees with
   geological histories was assessed using topology tests.
   Results We identified three major lineages of Middle American
   gophersnakes, and strong phylogeographical structure within each
   lineage. Gene trees were statistically congruent with hypothesized
   geological histories for two of the three postulated geological events.
   Estimated divergence dates and the geographical distribution of genetic
   variation further support mixed responses to these geological events.
   Considerable phylogeographical structure appears to have been generated
   during the Pleistocene.
   Main conclusions Phylogenetic and phylogeographical structure in
   gophersnakes distributed across northern Middle America and western
   North America highlights the influence of both Neogene vicariance events
   and Pleistocene climate change in shaping genetic diversity in this
   region. Despite the presence of two major geographical barriers in
   southern Mexico, extreme geological and environmental heterogeneity in
   this area may have differentially structured genetic diversity in
   highland taxa. To the north, co-distributed taxa may display a more
   predictable pattern of diversification across the warm desert regions.
   Future studies should incorporate nuclear data to disentangle inferred
   lineage boundaries and further elucidate patterns of mitochondrial
   introgression.},

Abstract = {Effects of artificial diets were tested on growth and digestive gland
   (DG) lipid composition of juvenile Octopus vulgaris. For Experiment I,
   three diets were used: (i) SQUID (Loligo gahi) as a control diet; (ii)
   Squid paste and fish hydrolysate CPSP (R), agglutinated with gelatine
   (GEL20); and (iii) Squid paste, fish hydrolysate CPSP (R) and gelatine
   (GEL40). For Experiment II, three diets were used: (i) SQUID, control
   diet; (ii) Squid paste, CPSP (R) and alginate (ALG10); and (iii) Squid
   paste, CPSP (R) and alginate (ALG20). For both experiments, growth rates
   for octopuses fed control were higher (P < 0.05), while artificial diets
   were not different (P > 0.05) between them. All diets promoted similar
   growth, regardless of the different CPSP (R) concentrations and binders.
   Growth rates obtained were among the highest obtained for O. vulgaris
   with artificial diets until now. The lower growth obtained with the
   artificial diets was greatly reflected in the DG fatty acid composition.
   The most important fatty acid groups, such as n-3 highly unsaturated
   fatty acids, decreased in the DG of animals fed artificial diets. Lipid
   content, particularly neutral lipids, was higher in the DG of octopuses
   fed squid, indicating higher nutritional condition of these animals
   compared to those fed the artificial diets.},

Title = {REDESCRIPTION AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF CUCULLANUS

Abstract = {Cucullanus dodsworthi Barreto, 1922 was originally described from the
   checkered puffer fish, Sphoeroides testudineus (Linnaeus), from
   Brazilian waters. New material of this nematode species was recovered
   from the same type host species from Mexican waters off the Yucatan
   Peninsula. This material was compared with Brazilian specimens. Although
   Mexican material closely resembles the original description of C
   dodsworthi in general appearance, previously undescribed characters, as
   observed by light and scanning electron microscopy, are described for
   the first time in this species from both Brazilian and Mexican
   specimens. These characters include lateral body alae or conspicuous
   lateral fields that begin in the cervical region and end anterior to
   first pair of adcloacal papillae in males and at the anus level in
   females, cephalic and caudal alae absent; presence of pseudobuccal
   capsule with simple buccal frame well sclerotized with dorsal arrow
   structures, lateral structures, and lateral reniform structures;
   deirids, excretory pore, and postdeirids; slight anal protuberance in
   both sexes, unpaired precloacal papilla in males, phasmids near pair 10
   in males and near tail tip in females; female with protruding vulvar
   lips and smooth eggs. In the absence of better descriptions of this
   genus, it can be concluded that C. dodsworthi is the only species of
   marine Cucullanus from the Americas that possesses lateral body alae.
   Molecular characterization of C dodsworthi with SSU (18S) and ITS2 rDNA
   genes is included. A preliminary genetic comparison between SSU rDNA of
   C. dodsworthi, Truttaedacnitis truttae (Fabricius, 1794), and Dichelyne
   mexicanus Caspeta-Mandujano, Moravec and Salgado-Maldonado, 1999 places
   C. dodsworthi as a putative sister taxon to T. truttae. The finding of C
   dodsworthi in Mexican marine waters also represents a new geographical
   record.},

Abstract = {Fibroblasts differ in a variety of phenotypic features, including the
   expression of Thy-1 a glycophosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein.
   Fibroblasts in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are Thy-1 negative,
   whereas most fibroblasts from normal lungs are Thy-1 positive. However,
   the functional consequences of the absence of Thy-1 are not fully
   understood. We analyzed the expression of Thy-1 in several primary
   fibroblasts lines derived from IPF, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP),
   and normal human lungs. We found that a high proportion, independently
   of their origin, expressed Thy-1 in vitro. We identified a primary
   culture of HP fibroblasts, which did not express Thy-1, and compared
   several functional activities between Thy-1 (-) and Thy-1 (+)
   fibroblasts. Thy-1 (-) fibroblasts were smaller (length: 41.3 +/- 20.8
   mu versus 83.1 +/- 40 mu), showed increased proliferative capacity and
   enhanced PDGF-induced transmigration through collagen I (59.9\% versus
   42.2\% over control under basal conditions, P<0.01). Likewise, Thy-1 (-)
   fibroblasts either spontaneously or after TGF-beta stimulation
   demonstrated stronger contraction of collagen matrices (eg, 0.17 +/-
   0.03 versus 0.6 +/- 0.05 cm(2) after TGF-beta stimulation at 24 h;
   P<0.01). Thy-1 (-) lung fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-beta 1 expressed
   MMP-9, an enzyme that is usually not produced by lung fibroblasts. TGF
   beta-induced MMP-9 expression was reversible upon re-expression of Thy-1
   after transfection with full-length Thy-1. beta-glycan, a TGF-beta
   receptor antagonist abolished MMP-9 expression. TGF-beta 1-induced MMP-9
   in Thy-1 (-) fibroblasts depended on the activation of ERK1/2 signaling
   pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that fibroblasts from IPF fibroblastic
   foci, which do not express Thy-1 exhibit strong staining for
   immunoreactive MMP-9 protein in vivo. These findings indicate that loss
   of Thy-1 in human lung fibroblasts induces a fibrogenic phenotype.

Title = {Introgressive hybridization between Brahea dulcis and Brahea

Abstract = {Gene introgression usually results from spontaneous hybridization among
   closely related species in sympatric populations. This phenomenon has
   recently become a frequent topic of interest in evolutionary and
   conservation biology. A palm species complex occurring in Mexico formed
   by two native species, Brahea dulcis (Kunth) C. Martius and Brahea
   nitida Andre, and their putative hybrids, was analyzed with
   morphological and molecular markers in four hybrid zones and two pure
   sites for each parental species. Our results showed that the closeness
   of the hybrids to an allopatric site of either parental species (B.
   nitida, mesic habitat, and B. dulcis, xeric habitat) is directly related
   to their morphological and genetic similarity. Also, B. dulcis differed
   significantly from B. nitida in all the examined characters.
   Morphological and molecular data were highly coincident and supported
   the hypothesized hybridization. Hybrid phenotypes were morphologically
   parent-like for 46.4\% of traits, intermediate for 33.2\% of traits, and
   transgressive for 10.0\% of traits. Thus, individual hybrids appear to
   be a mosaic of parent-like, intermediate, and transgressive phenotypes.
   Our results suggest that B. nitida has been genetically assimilated by
   B. dulcis in Xochiapala, and in the remaining hybrid zones a
   unidirectional pattern of gene flow towards B. nitida exists. Therefore,
   hybridization may threaten the conservation status of species through
   genetic assimilation and may confound the ability to distinguish among
   taxa.},

Abstract = {The main goal of this work was to determine the presence of arbuscular
   mycorrhizas in coastal dunes of Sisal, Mexico, and the seasonal and
   spatial changes in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community.
   The study was conducted at three coastal dune zones: embryonic, mobile
   and stabilized dunes. At each dune zone we chose five dominant plant
   species, collected roots and determined the percent of mycorrhizal
   colonization. We also took five soil samples at each dune zone to
   evaluate AMF spore density and number of infective propagules. The
   overall AMF colonization ranged from 15 to 19 \% depending on the dune
   zone and the season. The density of spores in 50 g soil was higher
   during the rainy (11.1 +/- 2.6) compared to the dry season (1.55 +/-
   0.2). AMF were present in root samples of all the plants studied, and
   infective propagules were present in all dune zones; this held true for
   both sampling seasons. The presence of viable AMF propagules across the
   successional vegetation gradient indicates the important role of this
   interaction on plant survivorship in stressful conditions such as that
   present in Sisal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological

Abstract = {Protozoa are important members of ecosystems, but protozoa that inhabit
   caves are poorly known worldwide. In this work, we present data on the
   record and distribution of thirteen protozoa species in four underground
   biotopes (water, soil, bat guano, and moss), at Cueva de Los Riscos. The
   samples were taken in six different months over more than a year.
   Protozoa species were ciliates (eight species), flagellates (three
   species), amoeboid (one species), and heliozoan (one species). Five of
   these species are reported for the first time inside cave systems
   anywhere, and an additional three species are new records for Mexican
   caves. Colpocla was the ciliate genera found in all cave zones sampled,
   and it inhabited the four biotopes together with Vorticella. The
   biotopes with the highest specific richness were the moss, sampled near
   the main cave entrance, and the temporary or permanent water bodies,
   with ten species each. The greatest number of species was observed in
   April 2006 (dry season). With the exception of water, all biotopes are

Abstract = {We present arguments which indicate that a transitional state in between
   two different regimes implies the occurrence of 1/f time series and that
   this property is generic in both classical and quantum systems. Our
   study focuses on two particular examples: the one-dimensional module-1
   logistic map and nuclear excitation spectra obtained with a schematic
   shell-model Hamiltonian. We suggest that a transitional point is
   characterized by the long-range correlations implied by 1/f time series.
   We apply a Fourier spectral analysis and the detrended fluctuation
   analysis method to study the fluctuations to each system.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the influence of steel fibers on the ultrasonic velocity
   of steel-fiber-reinforced cementitious materials was studied using a
   micromechanical model. To this end, a three-phase micromechanical model
   was extended and generalized to multiphase materials. Firstly, such a
   model was used to predict the influence of the geometry and volume
   fraction of steel inclusions on the ultrasonic velocity of
   steel-fiber-reinforced cementitious materials. Experimental validation
   was carried out on steel-reinforced and non-reinforced mortar specimens
   through destructive and non-destructive testing by ultrasound.
   Comparisons between predicted and measured ultrasonic velocity were in
   good agreement, with errors less than 1.5\%. Moreover, the model was
   also validated on experimental data obtained from steel-fiber-reinforced
   concrete specimens {[}c et al. Constr Build Mater 2007;21:1250-31. (C)

Abstract = {This is the first record of the association between Walkeromya plumipes
   (Philippi) (Diptera: Bombyliidae) and Xylocopa Latreille (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae) in Argentina. The pupal development and morphology of Walkeromya
   plumipes, a parasitoid of Xylocopa splendidula Lepeletier, are
   described. A parasitized nest was collected from Santiago del Estero
   province, Argentina. The development of the bombyliid fly and large
   carpenter bees in the nest were observed in the laboratory for a period
   of 28 days. A detailed description of the fly adult and pupal stages
   were carried out. This is the first record of W. plumipes parasitizing
   X. splendidula. This is also the first complete description of this fly
   species, including male genitalia. With the data presented here the
   geographical distribution of the parasite is expanded. The results
   suggest a close relation between the parasitoid and its host, as the
   genus Walkeromya Paranov has been found parasitizing only carpenter bees
   of genus Xylocopa.},

   Scripta, 40, 336-349.
   We studied the phylogenetic relationships in the genus Aulacorhynchus,
   an assemblage of Neotropical toucanets distributed from Mexico south to
   Bolivia. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA characters, we obtained
   a robust hypothesis of relationships for all recognized species,
   including good representation of distinct geographic populations. Our
   results support the monophyly of the genus Aulacorhynchus, but
   contradict previous taxonomic arrangements. The genus is made up of
   three major clades: the Aulacorhynchus prasinus complex, Aulacorhynchus
   huallagae + Aulacorhynchus coeruleicinctis, and Aulacorhynchus
   haematopygus + Aulacorhynchus sulcatus + Aulacorhynchus derbianus.
   Andean populations of A. derbianus are more closely related to A.
   sulcatus than to Pantepuian populations of A. derbianus, rendering A.
   derbianus paraphyletic. Based on the molecular phylogeny, and
   information on geographic distributions and morphological and
   behavioural characters, we review the specific status of these taxa and
   propose a new taxonomic arrangement within Aulacorhynchus.},

   and it is shown that entanglement between the different degrees of
   freedom is, in general, not invariant. We analyze the entanglement
   change in terms of the Wigner rotation induced by the transformation and
   show that, for the case of spin-1 particles, the relative entanglement

Abstract = {Annonaceae aporphine alkaloids, of which liriodenine is the most
   abundant, have not been extensively studied from a biological
   standpoint. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of
   liriodenine in antimicrobial defense during early developmental stages
   in Annona diversifolia. The fungi Rhizopus stolonifer and Aspergillus
   glaucus, which are responsible for seed deterioration, were isolated
   during imbibition, and their antifungal activity was determined by
   diffusion, macrodilution, and metabolic inhibition assays using purified
   liriodenine and alkaloid extracts obtained from embryos, radicles, and
   roots at early developmental stages. The presence of liriodenine in
   extracts was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Purified liriodenine and alkaloidal extracts inhibited both fungi, and
   there was a positive relationship between extract activity and amount of
   liriodenine contained therein. The quantity of liriodenine present in
   extracts suggests its importance in controlling other phytopathogens.},

Abstract = {Track analysis of the Neotropical Entimini (Coleoptera, Curculionidae,
   Entiminae). Distributional patterns of the species belonging to the
   tribe Entimini from the Neotropical region were analyzed. Based on a
   track analysis of 22 species of Entimus, Rhigus, and Phaedropus, for
   which distributional data were available, two generalized tracks were
   found. One is located in northern Brazil, corresponding to the Amazonian
   subregion, and is determined by Phaedropus candidus and Rhigus
   speciosus. The other is located in southern Brazil, corresponding to the
   Parana subregion, and is determined by Entimus imperialis, E. excelsus,
   Phaedropus regains, Rhigus dejeanii, R. faldermanni, R. horridus, R.
   lateritus, R. nigrosparsus, and R. tribuloides. The development of the
   Chacoan subregion is hypothesized to have been the dynamic vicariant
   event that fragmented the former Amazonian-Parana forest.},

Title = {A theory for microtremor H/V spectral ratio: application for a

Abstract = {Microtremors are produced by multiple random sources close to the
   surface of the Earth. They may include the effects of multiple
   scattering, which suggests that their intensities could be well
   described by diffusion-like equations. Within this theoretical
   framework, the average autocorrelation of the motions at a given
   receiver, in the frequency domain, measures average energy density and
   is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green's function (GF) when
   both source and receiver are the same.
   Assuming the seismic field is diffuse we compute the H/V ratio for a
   surface receiver on a horizontally layered medium in terms of the
   imaginary part of the GF at the source. This theory links average energy
   densities with the GF in 3-D and considers the H/V ratio as an intrinsic
   property of the medium. Therefore, our approach naturally allows for the
   inversion of H/V, the well-known Nakamura's ratio including the
   contributions of Rayleigh, Love and body waves. Broad-band noise records
   at Texcoco, a soft soil site near Mexico City, are studied and
   interpreted using this theory.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {14},
Pages = {8610-8618},

Abstract = {This paper deals with transient ignition of very lean hydrogen/air
   mixtures by thin catalytic wire in a natural convection environment.
   Modeling is accomplished via a reduced set of heterogeneous kinetic
   processes which include dissociative adsorption and desorption of both
   reactants, three fast surface reactions of the Langmiur-Hinshelwood type
   and the desorption reaction of the adsorbed product. For equivalence
   ratios smaller than a critical value (which in this case is 0.22), the
   ignition process shows a dual character, depending on the initial
   conditions for the surface coverages at the wire. Besides the classical
   thermal ignition mechanism, there is another branch called in this paper
   the equi-adsorption regime (EAR), characterized by equal adsorption
   rates of both reactants. In this regime, the overall reaction rates are
   very much higher than in the thermal regime, producing the combustion
   process at relatively low temperatures, even at room temperatures. A
   closed form solution for the overall reaction rate has obtained in this
   regime. This mechanism is appropriate to remove even traces of hydrogen
   in critical environments. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy

   seeks to know social reality and make evident the determinants of
   population growth and its interaction with other social variables, so
   that this knowledge serves to support actions that are intended to

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {We study the dynamics of carriers in graphene subjected to an
   inhomogeneous magnetic field. For a magnetic field with a hyperbolic
   profile the corresponding Dirac equation can be analyzed within the
   formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and leads to an exactly
   solvable model. We study in detail the bound-state spectrum. For a
   narrow barrier the spectrum is characterized by a few bands, except for
   the zero energy level that remains degenerated. As the width of the
   barrier increases we can track the band's evolution into the degenerated
   Landau levels. In the scattering regime a simple analytical formula is
   obtained for the transmission coefficient, this result allows us to
   identify the resonant conditions at which the barrier becomes
   transparent.},

   growth process is coupled with temperature variations, resulting in a
   novel Soret-type effect. We identified the surface entropy of the
   crystal/aggregate as a decisive ingredient controlling the behavior of
   the average growth rate as a function of temperature. The behavior of
   the Gibbs free energy as a function of temperature is also analyzed. The
   agreement between theory and experiments is very good in the range of

   distinct physiognomic types of mangroves in three locations of the La
   Mancha lagoon system in Veracruz, Mexico, during a complete annual
   cycle. We also evaluated the microtopography and ground water salinity
   along the profile and their relationship with forest structure and
   productivity. The South location showed four physiognomic types, whose
   forest attributes decreased as they were farther from the lagoon shore.
   Productivity and environment variables significantly varied among these
   physiognomic types. The Center location had two physiognomic types;
   there were significant differences in productivity and microtopography
   among these types, but not in salinity. The North location included two
   fragments of a basin forest type, and a pasture among them; productivity
   significantly varied among these forests, but microtopography and
   salinity were statistically similar. All study sites showed the
   following behavior: (1) as forest structure decreased, productivity also
   decreased and the dominant species changed. (2) As water salinity
   decreased, species dominance changed and productivity increased.
   Reproductive structures showed a notorious seasonality during the year
   in all species, except in R. mangle, which showed a permanent flower and
   propagules production. A. germinans reproduced only in the rainy season
   (August and September), because of their life history characteristics,
   whereas L. racemosa reproduced during the months of February and March
   as a response of the direct entrance of the water discharges, enriched
   with nutrients, that come from the sugar cane and rice crops. The South
   location was a relatively well conserved area, whereas the two other
   sites showed evidences of anthropic disturbances.},

Abstract = {In order to describe community structure and richness in oak and walnut
   forests occurring along the San Rodrigo, San Diego, Escondido and Arroyo
   de las Vacas rivers on the Northeastern Coastal Plain (NE Coahuila,
   Mexico), we established 30 1 000-m(2) circular plots, where we measured
   diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree heights. Tree regeneration and
   herb and shrub stratum were assessed in 5 2-m(2) quadrats per site. A
   total of 48 species distributed in 29 families were recorded. Families
   with the largest richness were Poaceae, Asteraceae, and Malvaceae. For
   the oak forest, tree stratum density and basal area values were 386
   stems/ha and 24.36 m(2)/ha, respectively, whereas for the walnut forest
   the corresponding values were 302 stems/ha and 21.26 m(2)/ha. The
   species with the highest relative importance values were Quercus
   fusiformis (59.48\%) and Carya illinoinensis (57.58\%). Total tree
   richness was 14 species, the most common ones being Celtis reticulata
   and Diospyros texana, followed closely by C. illinoinensis and Q.
   fusiformis. Anthropogenic impact appears to result in a poor
   regeneration reflected as a low sapling density, as well as in the
   reduction and fragmentation of these communities; in turn, this process
   has led to intrusions of species typical of the xerophytic Tamaulipan
   Thorn Scrub. Further studies are needed on the regeneration of the
   dominant species of these forests in order to describe their dynamics
   and to promote their preservation.},

Abstract = {Mixed bird flocks are groups of individuals from different species that
   travel and forage together. Such groups are common in several bird
   communities around the world. We present species composition and
   activity patterns of mixed bird flocks in a region of the Central Andes
   of Colombia. We compared the number of species per flock, as well as the
   number of flocks among 3 different habitats. We tested hypotheses
   concerning the flocks daily activity and the co-occurrences of species
   within them. We recorded 75 species, and the species number per flock
   varied from 4 to 21. Our data suggest that habitat affects the number of
   flocks but not their species number, and that the activity of flocks is
   similar throughout the day. In addition, the association of birds in
   flocks is affected by interspecific facilitation, with some species
   co-occurrences found more times than expected by chance. We hypothesize
   that some tanager species could have a role in flock cohesion. We
   witnessed 2 predator attacks upon flocks, a number of agonistic
   interactions among flock members, and squirrels following bird flocks.
   Our results meet some general patterns described for mixed bird flocks.},

Abstract = {Short pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were functionalized
   with a series of long-chain (including polymeric) aliphatic amines,
   namely octadecylamine (ODA), 1,8-diaminooctane (DO), polyethylene glycol
   diamine (PEGDA) and polyethylenimine (PEI), via two ``green{''}
   approaches: (1) gas-phase functionalization (for volatile ODA and DO)
   and (2) direct heating in the melt (for polymeric PEGDA and PEI). Both
   of them consist in one-step reaction between MWNTs and amine without the
   use of organic solvents. The nanostructures obtained were characterized
   by using infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning
   electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron
   microscopy. It was observed that both solvent-free methods were
   efficient in the nanotube functionalization, and the nanostructures of
   variable solubility and morphology were obtained depending on the amines
   attached. ODA, PEGDA and PEI-functionalized MWNTs were found to be
   soluble in propanol, meanwhile the MWNTs-PEGDA and MWNTs-PEI were
   soluble in water as well. The attachment of 1,8-diaminooctane onto MWNTs
   resulted in cross-linked stable nanostructure.},

Abstract = {The self-assembly of porphyrins into highly organized functional arrays
   supported on appropriate solid substrates is an area of research with
   multiple potential applications in the ``bottom-up{''} approach to
   manufacturing. In order to analyze the self-assembly of
   meso-tetraphenylporphine (H(2)TPP) on the surfaces of highly oriented
   pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), we
   performed molecular mechanics modeling (by MM+ force field) and scanning
   tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging. Molecular modeling predicted an
   energetic preference of the H(2)TPP molecules to adsorb in monolayers on
   the surfaces of graphite and SWNT sidewall, rather than their stacking
   or separation. On graphite, the most favorable arrays were predicted to
   be ribbons composed of interacting parallel chains of H(2)TPP molecules.
   On the SWNT sidewall, the energetic preference pointed toward the
   formation of parallel and interacting long-period helixes, resulting in
   an almost full coverage of the SWNT surface. These preferable arrays on
   both carbon materials assure the interaction of every porphyrin unit
   with as many neighbors as possible, thus lowering the potential energy
   of the adsorption complexes. STM imaging results are in good agreement
   with molecular modeling predictions. The formation of self-assembled
   ribbons was a frequently observed phenomenon on the HOPG surface, while
   on the SWNT surface a full coverage of the exposed portion of the
   sidewalls was observed, suggesting the formation of interacting
   long-period helixes. A preferential adsorption of H(2)TPP molecules near
   graphite topographic defects was also observed.},

Abstract = {We present some families of horseshoe periodic orbits in the general
   planar three-body problem for the case of two equal masses. The
   considered system is a symmetric version of the one formed by Saturn,
   Janus and Epimetheus. We use a mass ratio equal to 35x10(-5),
   corresponding to 10(5) times the Saturn-Janus mass parameter of the
   restricted case; for this mass ratio the satellites have a significantly
   bigger influence on the planet than in the classical Saturn, Janus and
   Epimetheus system. To obtain periodic orbits, we search those horseshoe
   orbits passing through two reversible configurations. A particular kind
   of periodic orbits where the minor bodies follow the same path is
   discussed.},

Title = {Nurse-plant and mulching effects on three conifer species in a Mexican

Abstract = {Nurse-plant effects have been used as an effective reforestation and
   restoration strategy, and mulching has also effectively ameliorated
   soil-adverse conditions. However, use of nurse plants is limited by the
   presence of suitable nurse species before trees are planted, and use of
   mulching depends on availability of appropriate materials. The effects
   of Lupinus elegans as a nurse plant and pine-bark mulch were tested on
   three conifer species: Pinus montezumae, Pinus pseudostrobus, and Abies
   religiosa. We tested if nurse-plant type effects occurred if the lupines
   and the conifers were planted simultaneously. Overall survival was 53\%,
   and significant differences among species were found. Survival
   regardless of cover type was significantly higher (P < 0.01) for P.
   pseudostrobus 17-month-old seedlings at planting (81\%), followed by P.
   montezumae 7-month-old seedlings at planting (71\%), P. pseudostrobus
   7-month-old seedlings at planting (42\%) and finally A. religiosa
   7-month-old seedlings at planting (17\%) the differences among the
   treatments were significant (P < 0.01). As a soil shading agent, lupines
   had a significant effect (P = 0.02), because they increased survival of
   P. pseudostrobus and A. religiosa, the effect of mulching with pine bark
   was not significant. The effects of a shading agent on growth differed
   among species. In particular lupines reduced height and stem diameter
   for P. montezumae and P. pseudostrobus, between 22\% and 33\%, and had
   no effect on growth of A. religiosa. The positive effects of the
   simultaneous planting of L elegans on the survival of the trees suggests
   that nurse-plant facilitation can be used in areas where no suitable
   nurse plants are already present. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Five populations of freshwater red algae were investigated between
   February 2008 and September 2009 in four segments of the Jarama River
   Basin (Tajo Basin), Iberian Peninsula, between 40-41 degrees N, 3-4
   degrees W, at 700 to 1200 m altitude. Three species were documented
   (Batrachospermum gelatinosum, Lemanea fluviatilis and Paralemanea
   catenata) and information was collected about includes their morphology
   and the physical and chemical characteristics of the water. All the taxa
   have been reported previously, but the present work includes the first
   detailed morphological description of red algae in the region and their
   ecological preferences. The waters in these study sites are cool to
   temperate (5-17 degrees C), acid to circumneutral (pH 6.3-7.5) and with
   a low ion concentration (specific conductivity 77-270 mu S cm(-1)). Two
   groups were distinguished on the basis of nutrient concentration. The
   first group, which included B. gelatinosum and L..fluviatilis, is found
   in clean water with low nutrient concentration, while the second group,
   which included P. catenata, occurred in nutrient-rich water.
   Gametophytes of L. fluviatilis and P catenata were present in all
   seasons, with the highest percentage cover in autumn and winter
   corresponding to high current velocity and low water temperature.
   However, gametophytes were longest, and spermatangial sod and
   carposporophytes were most abundant in spring when current velocity was
   low and water temperature was high. The distribution of Batrachosermales
   from the Jarama Basin showed a strong affinity with temperate regions of
   central Europe and floras of other continents.},

Title = {Antimutagenic activity of two medicinal phytoextracts in somatic cells

Journal = {PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {640-647},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Context and Objective: We used the wing somatic assay in Drosophila
   melanogaster to test the hypothesis that two phytoextracts from Cecropia
   obtusifolia Bertol (Cecropiaceae) and Equisetum myriochaetum Schlecht.
   et Cham (Equisetaceae), which are used in folk medicine to treat type 2
   diabetes mellitus, could detoxify the mutagen hydrogen peroxide.
   Materials and methods: Third instar larvae from standard (ST) and
   high-bioactivation (HB) crosses were chronically exposed to different
   concentrations of the phytoextracts. Hydrogen peroxide was used to
   induce oxidative stress and was chronically tested in both crosses.
   Catalase activity was measured in larvae of both strains 48 h after
   treatment with hydrogen peroxide. A pretreatment protocol was devised to
   test the antimutagenic potency of the medicinal extracts.
   Results: The present study showed that neither of the phytoextracts were
   genotoxic in Drosophila. Interestingly, the antioxidant enzyme activity
   levels were different between the larvae. Hydrogen peroxide resulted in
   a significant genotoxic effect in the ST cross, whereas a detoxification
   of hydrogen peroxide was found in the HB cross. Thus, catalase was
   stimulated in the HB cross, which was indicative of a cellular defense
   mechanism mounted against a xenobiotic hazard. We found that the
   percentage of inhibition of spots produced by E. myriochaetum was much
   higher than that induced by Cecropia obtusifolia.
   Discussion and conclusions: These results are in agreement with the uses
   of these phytoextracts in traditional medicine. Indeed, the lack of
   genotoxicity and the antimutagenic activity observed for both
   phytoextracts validates their use as a therapeutic modality to treat
   diabetic patients. Moreover, these extracts are suitable for consumption
   as teas and/or phytomedicines.},

Abstract = {We determined that Eupatorium petiolare was either wind pollinated or
   self-fertilized, that Tagetes lunulata and Verbesina virgata showed
   autonomous self-fertilization, that Dahlia coccinea seems to be
   self-incompatible and pollinated by diurnal insects, and that, although
   overall longevity of capitula of virgata was greater in shaded sites,
   production of fruit per capitulum was greater in sunny sites. Overall
   longevity of capitula and longevity of capitula in the mature-flower
   stage showed great variability among species; overall longevity of
   capitula was longer for those species flowering during the rainy season
   and longevity of the mature-flower phenophase was shorter for D.
   coccinea (the only species dependent upon vectors for its pollination).
   High density of flowers, few barriers to dispersal of pollen (low
   arboreal coverage), and increased photosynthetic radiation typical of
   sunny sites seem to favor transfer of pollen, resulting in higher
   pollination and fruiting success than that experienced by plants in
   shaded sites.},

Abstract = {We propose a method for capturing vocalizations that is designed to
   avoid some of the limiting factors found in traditional bioacoustical
   methods, such as the impossibility of obtaining continuous long-term
   registers or analyzing amplitude due to the continuous change of
   distance between the subject and the position of the recording system.
   Using Bluetooth technology, vocalizations are captured and transmitted
   wirelessly into a receiving system without affecting the quality of the
   signal. The recordings of the proposed system were compared to those
   obtained as a reference, which were based on the coding of the signal
   with the so-called pulse-code modulation technique in WAV audio format
   without any compressing process. The evaluation showed p < .05 for the
   measured quantitative and qualitative parameters. We also describe how
   the transmitting system is encapsulated and fixed on the animal and a
   way to video record a spider monkey's behavior simultaneously with the
   audio recordings.},

Abstract = {We studied the reproductive cycle of Sceloporus ochoterenae from the
   population that occurs in a relict tropical deciduous forest in central
   Morelos. Males are significantly larger in snout vent-length (SVL) 49.53
   +/- 2.40 mm, and heavier (x= 3.66 +/- 0.68 g) than females (SVL 46.37
   +/- 2.08 mm, weight 3.34 +/- 1.23 g), which indicate that this species,
   like many other sceloporines is sexually dimorphic. There are
   differences in reproductive cycles between sexes; males begin
   reproductive activity in March with maximum activity in May, whereas
   females sum reproduction at the beginning of the rainy season (May),
   with highest period during the rainy season (July). Precipitation and
   temperature are correlated positively with the reproductive cycles of
   males and females. The average clutch was 5 eggs and was positively
   related to female size. In contrast, size and weight of females had no
   significant effect on relative clutch mass (mean = 0.245). In general,
   the reproductive characteristics of this Morelos' population are
   different from those observed in Guerrero.},

Title = {Partial characterization of hepatopancreatic and extracellular digestive
   proteinases of wild and cultivated Octopus maya},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {445-457},

Abstract = {Proteinases from hepatopancreas (HP) and gastric juice (GJ) from wild
   and cultured red octopus (Octopus maya) were characterized.
   Hepatopancreas assays revealed optimal activity at pH 4, 9-10 and 10 for
   wild and pH 3, 8, and 9, for cultured octopuses, for total proteinases,
   trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. In the gastric juice, maximum
   activity was recorded at pH 6, 8, and 7 for total proteinases, trypsin,
   and chymotrypsin, respectively for both wild and cultured octopus. A
   reduction on enzyme activity of 70 and 20\% was observed in HP and GJ
   extracts, respectively when protease inhibitor Pepstatin A was used.
   That result suggests that the main proteases in the HP were aspartic
   acid proteinases type (possibly Cathepsin D) and some of them were
   present in the GJ. Dissociating discontinuous polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis showed activity bands between 20 and 28, 30 and 34, 35
   and 45, 60 and 70 kDa, and a last one between 75 and 100 kDa. We
   concluded that extracellular digestion of O. maya takes place in an acid
   environment, around pH 6. In contrast, intracellular digestion in the HP
   is developed at pHs between 3 and 4, where cathepsin D could be the most
   important enzyme for O. maya.},

Abstract = {The gas-phase treatment with 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) is proposed as
   an efficient way of chemical functionalization of fullerene C-60 thin
   films in order to modify their electronic properties; a temperature of
   190 degrees C and reaction time of 4 h were found to be optimal reaction
   conditions. Two amino groups of DAN add on two neighboring C-60 cages,
   thus producing cross-links in the fullerene phase. The resulting
   oligomeric and/or polymeric products exhibit a lower solubility in
   toluene as compared to pristine C-60 films. The functionalized films
   exhibit lower surface roughness, as found by atomic force microscopy.
   Raman spectra keep, with some decrease in intensity, the most important
   features of C-60 upon functionalization. The infrared band intensities
   corresponding to pristine fullerene decrease even stronger, where a
   number of new absorption bands appear not only due to DAN moieties, but
   also due to the covalently derivatized C-60 cages. The diamine molecules
   are able to penetrate throughout the entire fullerene phase to provide
   an efficient and uniform functionalization. As a result, the
   DAN-functionalized films exhibit higher conductivity as compared to that
   of pristine films not only along the surface layer, but also through the
   entire phase of C-60, by one and four orders of magnitude, respectively.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Neutral atom magnetic traps and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
   require internal regions with constant gradient magnetic induction
   fields, which are identified as pure quadrupole fields. This
   contribution starts from such fields in the interior of spheres and
   spheroids in cartesian coordinates, identifying immediately their
   respective scalar magnetic potentials. Next, the corresponding
   potentials inside and outside are constructed using spherical and
   spheroidal harmonic functions, respectively, except for a
   proportionality constant to be determined by the boundary conditions at
   the surface of spheres r = a, prolate xi = xi(0) and oblate zeta =
   zeta(0) spheroids, where the electric current sources are distributed.
   The negative gradients of the scalar potentials yield the respective
   magnetic induction fields inside (r <= a, xi <= xi(0), zeta <= zeta(0))
   and outside (r >= a, xi >= xi(0), zeta >= zeta(0)). Gauss's law in its
   boundary condition form determines the normalization constant of the
   external potentials, while Ampere's law determines the electric current
   source distributions on the surface of the spheres and spheroids.},

   the strangest manifestation of known coordinations, and thus we have
   studied several known and simulated compounds of this kind in order to
   understand the lack of examples. The presence of other eta(6) or eta(5)
   ligands on the opposite side seems to be an important element aiding the
   stabilization of these complexes, also inducing the conductive and
   semiconductive behaviour of the studied species.},

Abstract = {Original extracts from an unpublished 1958 experiment conducted by the
   late Stanley L. Miller were recently found and analyzed using modern
   state-of-the-art analytical methods. The extracts were produced by the
   action of an electric discharge on a mixture of methane (CH(4)),
   hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), ammonia (NH(3)), and carbon dioxide (CO(2)).
   Racemic methionine was formed in significant yields, together with other
   sulfur-bearing organic compounds. The formation of methionine and other
   compounds from a model prebiotic atmosphere that contained H(2)S
   suggests that this type of synthesis is robust under reducing
   conditions, which may have existed either in the global primitive
   atmosphere or in localized volcanic environments on the early Earth. The
   presence of a wide array of sulfur-containing organic compounds produced
   by the decomposition of methionine and cysteine indicates that in
   addition to abiotic synthetic processes, degradation of organic
   compounds on the primordial Earth could have been important in
   diversifying the inventory of molecules of biochemical significance not
   readily formed from other abiotic reactions, or derived from
   extraterrestrial delivery.},

Abstract = {This study describes the relationship between egg size (ES) and brood
   size (BS), newborn length (NL) and female total length (FTL) in ten
   species of Cuban poeciliids. Variability and the level of association
   among variables are analysed and comparisons of ES among species
   established. Egg size has the lowest variability among the analysed
   variables and in most species is not correlated with BS, when the effect
   of FTL is controlled. Cuban poeciliids, thought to be primarily
   lecithotrophic, can be separated in two groups according to ES, NL and
   BS relative to FTL. One such group inhabits mountain streams and
   produces large eggs and small broods. The other group is distributed in
   lowland wetlands and produces small eggs and large broods. In Cuban
   poeciliids, ES and NL are highly correlated, which suggests adaptive
   value for ES.},

   numerous dark brown spots and lacking a vertebral stripe and a high
   density of granules on the dorsum producing a rugose skin texture. The
   most developed of the cranial crests is the supraorbital, while the
   parietal is poorly developed. Incilius mccoyi inhabits pine and pine-oak
   forests of the southwestern Sierra Madre Occidental in Chihuahua,

Abstract = {Edge effects play a key role in forest dynamics in which the context of
   the anthropogenic matrix has a great influence on fragment connectivity
   and function. The study of the interaction between edge and matrix
   effects in nature is essential to understand and promote the
   colonization of some functional groups in managed ecosystems. We studied
   the dynamics of 7 species of frogs and salamanders occurring in 8
   ecotones of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) which interact with
   adjacent managed areas of coffee and corn plantations in Guerrero,
   southern Mexico. A survey effort of 196 man/hours along 72 transects
   detected 58 individuals of 7 amphibian species and 12 environmental and
   structural variables were measured. The diversity and abundance of
   amphibians in the forest mostly depended on the matrix context adjacent
   to the forest patches. The forest interior provided higher relative
   humidity, leaf litter cover, and canopy cover that determined the
   presence of some amphibian species. The use of shaded coffee plantations
   was preferred by the amphibians over the corn plots possibly due to the
   maintenance of native forest arboreal elements, low management rate and
   less intensity of disturbance in the coffee plantations than in the corn
   plots. Shaded coffee plantations reduce the edge effects in TMCF,
   improve the connectivity between TMCF fragments and increase habitat
   quality for the forest interior amphibian species. Future wildlife
   management research should take into account edge and matrix effects to
   understand species dynamics which move along anthropogenic-natural
   ecotones in managed ecosystems, thus prioritizing sites to buffer edge
   effects and increase habitat quality in remaining natural ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Areas covered: The authors searched the Medline database from January
   1990 to December 2010 using search terms `'pulmonary fibrosis'',
   `'fibrosing alveolitis'' and `'usual interstitial pneumonia''. Several
   subsets were included: definition and epidemiology, risk factors,
   clinical behavior, pathogenesis and therapy. For the section of IPF
   treatment, the authors examined all relevant studies including
   randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and
   cross-sectional studies. In this review, the authors describe the
   current therapeutic approaches, the ongoing clinical trials and some
   future options based on stem cells, lung bioengineering and microRNAs.
   Expert opinion: The treatment of IPF represents one of the greatest
   challenges confronting respiratory medicine and, currently, there is no
   effective therapeutic option for IPF. Perhaps some of the drugs that are
   under evaluation in clinical trials will slow the decline of the
   pulmonary function tests or hopefully stabilize some patients.
   Nonetheless, it appears clear that new therapeutic approaches are
   urgently needed.},

Title = {Public Policies in the Archetype of Democratic Governance},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2011},
Number = {50},
Pages = {167+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the relevance that public policies have in the
   democratic governance's procedures, in which the process of power
   relates the society, the State, citizens and market in a complex way
   until edify processes connected with the public management which has as
   target to asseverate the functionality of associated life over the base
   of attention and solution of public problems. In order to achieve this
   goal, the political and economic agreements are fundamental to aloud
   that the courses of government action to be, not a result of vertical
   postures which respond more to an authoritarian vision of power, which
   takes place when contemporary societies as well as citizen mobilizations
   that define them, are the most constant tendency which reflects how the
   power exercise has public dimensions that originate horizontal relations
   that combines actors, networks, and strategies that make pressure in
   order to not be excluded from the decision making and the distribution
   of public resources, which feed the programs to route the development of
   productivity activities that have market economy and public action as an
   axis. It is emphasized that the organized intervention of civil society
   in the institutional agendas, and the adoption of policies has
   transformed the ways through which power is used to generate results by
   means of cooperation, coordination and joint responsibility, and in that
   way, public direction is the result of new interactions that
   simultaneously sustain the correlation of forces in the public space,
   since this is plural, diverse and interdependent. In this sense, the
   government processes need to be more open and deliberative in order to
   fortify the spirit and content of democracy, understood as the way that
   allows solving, in the most including and peaceful form, collective
   problems.
   The document emphasizes that the value of democracy also depends from
   institutional adjustments that are formalized considering the increasing
   demands, limited resources and interested actors, in an active way, in
   public issues; which means that they are not a monopoly of the
   constitutive authority, but they have civic and social amplitude that is
   fortified as it increases the citizen participation in the processes of
   public policies. In this logic, they are reclaimed by diverse public
   form society; issue, that orders the necessity of building a bridge of
   communication and collaboration between the ``public of the society and
   public of the State{''} in order to achieve that design and
   implementation of public policies to be interactive. Another relevant
   point in this paper is that the collective goals demand that the
   articulation of interests has to be guaranteed, not by centralized
   practices, but with a democratic scope that allows politics as a result
   of open discussions and arguments, which are consistent with a form of
   government that responds to citizens by the design of institutional
   ways, that stimulate the cooperation of society organizations in the
   management of common matters.},

Abstract = {A new species of Haematoloechus is described from the lungs of Rana
   boylii from Humboldt County, California. The new species is similar to
   Haematoloechus buttensis, Haematoloechus kernensis, and Haematoloechus
   complex-us in general course of the uterus and gonad shape. it is
   similar to H. buttensis by having a cirrus sac terminating midway
   between the posterior margin of the pharynx and the anterior margin of
   the ovary, and having a smaller oral/ventral sucker ratio; to H.
   complex-us by having the genital pore ventral to the pharynx, and it is
   similar to H. kernensis by having a larger oral sucker to pharynx width
   ratio. The new species is unique by lacking an extra-cecal longitudinal
   uterine loop from the hind-body. Molecularly, the new species differs
   1.04-1.15\% in partial 28S sequence with respect to H. complex-us, and a
   monophyletic grouping of these specimens in a phylogenetic analysis of
   all available sequence data consistent with the species-specific status
   proposed herein. Evidence is also presented to suggest that specimens
   identified as H. buttensis in Rana pretiosa from British Columbia,
   Canada represents a new, but still undeseribed species. The importance
   of conducting biological inventories of helminths, along with continued
   monitoring of populations, and collections based taxonomy are related.},

Abstract = {A theoretical study based on the density functional theory of the
   adsorption of Mn monomers and dimers on a Au-(111) surface is presented.
   As necessary preliminary steps, the bulk and clean surface electronic
   structure are calculated, which agree well with previous reports. Then,
   the electronic structure of the Mn adatom, chemisorbed on four different
   surface geometries, is analyzed. It is found that the most stable
   geometry is when the Mn atom is chemisorbed on threefold coordinated
   sites. Using this geometry for a single adatom a second Mn atom is
   chemisorbed and the most stable dimer geometrical structure is
   calculated. The lowest-energy configuration corresponds to the molecule
   lying parallel to the surface, adsorbed on two topological equivalent
   threefold coordinated sites. It is also found that the lowest-energy
   magnetic configuration corresponds to the antiferromagnetic arrangement
   with individual magnetic moments of 4.64 mu(B). Finally, it is concluded
   that the dimer is not stable and should fragment at the surface.},

Title = {The role of historical and contemporary processes on phylogeographic
   structure and genetic diversity in the Northern Cardinal, Cardinalis
   cardinalis},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Background: Earth history events such as climate change are believed to
   have played a major role in shaping patterns of genetic structure and
   diversity in species. However, there is a lag between the time of
   historical events and the collection of present-day samples that are
   used to infer contemporary population structure. During this lag phase
   contemporary processes such as dispersal or non-random mating can erase
   or reinforce population differences generated by historical events. In
   this study we evaluate the role of both historical and contemporary
   processes on the phylogeography of a widespread North American songbird,
   the Northern Cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis.
   Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed deep mtDNA structure with six
   lineages across the species' range. Ecological niche models supported
   the same geographic breaks revealed by the mtDNA. A paleoecological
   niche model for the Last Glacial Maximum indicated that cardinals
   underwent a dramatic range reduction in eastern North America, whereas
   their ranges were more stable in Mexico. In eastern North America
   cardinals expanded out of glacial refugia, but we found no signature of
   decreased genetic diversity in areas colonized after the Last Glacial
   Maximum. Present-day demographic data suggested that population growth
   across the expansion cline is positively correlated with latitude. We
   propose that there was no loss of genetic diversity in areas colonized
   after the Last Glacial Maximum because recent high-levels of gene flow
   across the region have homogenized genetic diversity in eastern North
   America.
   Conclusion: We show that both deep historical events as well as
   demographic processes that occurred following these events are critical
   in shaping genetic pattern and diversity in C. cardinalis. The general
   implication of our results is that patterns of genetic diversity are
   best understood when information on species history, ecology, and
   demography are considered simultaneously.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {44},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Let P be a set of n points in the plane. A geometric proximity graph on
   P is a graph where two points are connected by a straight-line segment
   if they satisfy some prescribed proximity rule. We consider four classes
   of higher order proximity graphs, namely, the k-nearest neighbor graph,
   the k-relative neighborhood graph, the k-Gabriel graph and the
   k-Delaunay graph. For k = 0 (k = 1 in the case of the k-nearest neighbor
   graph) these graphs are plane, but for higher values of k in general
   they contain crossings. In this paper, we provide lower and upper bounds
   on their minimum and maximum number of crossings. We give general bounds
   and we also study particular cases that are especially interesting from
   the viewpoint of applications. These cases include the 1-Delaunay graph
   and the k-nearest neighbor graph for small values of k. (C) 2010

Abstract = {We study, by numerical simulations and semi-rigorous arguments, a
   two-parameter family of convex, two-dimensional billiard tables,
   generalizing the one-parameter class of oval billiards of
   Benettin-Strelcyn (1978 Phys. Rev. A17 773-85). We observe interesting
   dynamical phenomena when the billiard tables are continuously deformed
   from the integrable circular billiard to different versions of
   completely chaotic stadia. In particular, we conjecture that a new class
   of ergodic billiard tables is obtained in certain regions of the
   two-dimensional parameter space, when the billiards are close to skewed
   stadia. We provide heuristic arguments supporting this conjecture, and
   give numerical confirmation using the powerful method of
   Lyapunov-weighted dynamics.},

Title = {Synthesis and structural analysis of
   Bi2-ySryIr2O7,
   a new pyrochlore solid solution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {This paper presents a study of the synthesis and structural properties
   of the new pyrochlore-type Bi2-ySryIr2O7 series. Ten compositions with
   0.0 <= y <= 0.9 were prepared by solid-state reaction with thermal
   treatments at 873, 1073 and 1323 K under atmospheric pressure
   conditions. Structural refinements from X-ray powder diffraction data by
   the Rietveld method show that all compounds of the Bi2-ySryIr2O7 solid
   solution crystallize in a alpha-pyrochlore structure. The main
   structural difference when bismuth is substituted by strontium concerns
   the x position of the O1 (x, (1)/(8), (1)/(8)). This substitution
   significantly increases the Bi/Sr-O1 distance and diminishes the Ir-O1
   distance; this implies that the Ir-O1-Ir bond angle increases. With the
   Sr substitution, the IrO6 local configuration goes from a flattened
   trigonal antiprism, y < 0.5, to an elongated one, y > 0.5, passing
   through an octahedral array, y similar to 0.5. The electrical
   consequences of these structural changes observed in this system are
   qualitatively explained with electronic structure calculations, this
   behavior agrees very well with those observed in other pyrochlore
   systems A(2)M(2)O(7) (A = rare earth cations or T1(+), Pb2+, or Bi3+,
   and M=Ru or Ir). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the sequence of the histological
   and stereological changes that occur in diverse components of left
   growing and right regressing ovaries of Gallus domesticus as well as the
   variations in the number and size of the different cell subpopulations
   from 8-day-old chicken embryo to 4-week-old chickens. Results indicate a
   bilateral asymmetry in favor of the left ovary at all ages studied. The
   left ovary shows cortex and medulla, but the right ovary has no cortex,
   only a medulla. Stereological results show in the left ovary an increase
   in total volume of all components of the ovarian medulla with advancing
   development. The right ovary follows a similar pattern until the age of
   1-day-old chicken, to regress afterward, thereby, reducing the total
   volume of blood vessels, lacunar channels, and interstitium, but
   increasing the total volume of interstitial cells as development
   progresses; consequently, the total volume of interstitial cells is the
   dominant component in the right ovary of 4-week-old chickens. Results
   also reveal that the increase in total volume of interstitial cells in
   the left ovary at all ages and in the right ovary from 8-day-old chicken
   embryo to 1-day-old chicken is due to hyperplasia and cell hypertrophy
   of interstitial cells; hence, in the right ovary, cell hypertrophy is
   the main cause for the increase in the total volume of interstitial
   cells from 1-week-old to 4-week-old chickens. Anat Rec, 294: 893-904,

Abstract = {We explore the consequences of a force density, -1/c partial derivative
   M/partial derivative t x E, studied by some authors, for the device
   designed by Lai (1980 Am. J. Phys. 48 658) to analyse which definition
   of electromagnetic momentum density, either Minkowski's or Abraham's, is
   consistent with mechanical torques that arise from the change in time of
   a magnetic field, which produces an induced electric field that acts on
   free and polarization charges. It is found that Minkowski's definition
   is consistent with the mechanical torques associated with free charges,
   while Abraham's is consistent with mechanical torques associated with
   both free and polarization charges. We show that with this new force
   density Lai's work (1980 Am. J. Phys. 48 658) can be extended to include
   magnetic media. The results are consistent with Abraham's definition of
   electromagnetic momentum density, extending in this way its usefulness
   to magnetic media.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the present work we analyze the old controversy of Abraham and
   Minkowski from the microscopic point of view, and from the perspective
   of a momentum balance equation. Thus we complete the line of research on
   this subject initiated by Lai et al. (H.M. Lai, W.M. Suen, K. Young,
   Phys. Rev. A 25, 1755 (1982)). We find that a new term, -1/c partial
   derivative m/partial derivative t x E, justified with several arguments,
   some of which founded in relativity theory, gives a more coherent view
   of the controversy. As a test for this approach, we show that the
   Helmholtz force density may be obtained from a momentum balance equation
   derived directly from Maxwell's equations under certain approximations;
   we find with this analysis that rather than resolve the controversy, we
   can dissolve it. That is, we have rather a problem of physical
   interpretation, since we show that other momentum balance equations are
   also all legitimate implications of Maxwell's equations.},

Abstract = {Partial sequences of the 28S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome c oxidase I
   (COI) genes were compared among populations of a widely distributed and
   morphologically uniform digenean species in North America,
   Phyllodistomum lacustri, a parasite characteristically associated with
   ictalurid catfishes. Specimens were collected from the urinary bladder
   of ictalurid hosts in six localities of North America, spanning most of
   the latitudinal range of this freshwater fish group. Sequences of other
   congeneric species, including a potentially close relative, P.
   staffordi, were also obtained and used for comparison. Analyses of both
   molecular markers show very low or no intrapopulation variation within
   each sampling site. However, samples of P. lacustri from different hosts
   and regions exhibit varying levels of interpopulation genetic
   differences. Such differences are explained by the wide geographical
   distribution and host range of the ictalurids they parasitize,
   particularly in ictalurids distributed in Mexican freshwaters where they
   experienced a diversification process. Variation in both nuclear and
   mitochondrial genes and phylogenetic analyses, in conjunction with
   geographical and host information (drainage isolation and endemicity of
   the host species), indicate that at least three populations show
   potential as cryptic species.},

Title = {Seed reserve composition in 19 tree species of a tropical deciduous

Abstract = {Background and Aims The size and composition of seed reserves may
   reflect the ecological strategy and evolutionary history of a species
   and also temporal variation in resource availability. The seed mass and
   composition of seed reserves of 19 co-existing tree species were
   studied, and we examined how they varied among species in relation to
   germination and seedling growth rates, as well as between two years with
   contrasting precipitation (652 and 384 mm).
   Methods Seeds were collected from a tropical deciduous forest in the
   northwest of Mexico (Chamela Biological Station). The seed dry mass,
   with and without the seed coat, and the concentrations of lipids,
   nitrogen and nonstructural carbohydrates for the seed minus seed coat
   were determined. The anatomical localization of these reserves was
   examined using histochemical analysis. The germination capacity, rate
   and lag time were determined. The correlations among these variables,
   and their relationship to previously reported seedling relative growth
   rates, were evaluated with and without phylogenetic consideration.
   Key Results There were interannual differences in seed mass and reserve
   composition. Seed was significantly heavier after the drier year in five
   species. Nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with seed coat
   fraction, and was significantly higher after the drier year in 12
   species. The rate and lag time of germination were negatively correlated
   with each other. These trait correlations were also supported for
   phylogenetic independent contrasts. Principal component analysis
   supported these correlations, and indicated a negative association of
   seedling relative growth rate with seed size, and a positive association
   of germination rate with nitrogen and lipid concentrations.
   Conclusions Nitrogen concentration tended to be higher after the drier
   year and, while interannual variations in seed size and reserve
   composition were not sufficient to affect interspecific correlations
   among seed and seedling traits, some of the reserves were related to
   germination variables and seedling relative growth rate.},

Abstract = {At present, the production of merobenthic octopuses with a post-eclosion
   planktonic phase is a great challenge for global aquaculture. So far,
   juveniles from only four species have been reported to have been

   joubini, Enteroctopus dofleini and Robsonella fontaniana, the only
   Chilean species. R. fontaniana (Orbigny, 1834) is a small-sized octopus
   traded in international markets as ``baby octopus{''}. It is distributed
   over nearly the entire southern coast of South America, both in the
   Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This study shows new results regarding the
   biochemical characteristics in embryonic and paralarval stages, as well
   as the characteristics of food consumption during the paralarval stage
   that allow us to discuss a baseline on which to define a strategy for
   the larviculture of this species. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights

Abstract = {During winter, monarch butterflies form dense colonies in oyamel fir
   forests on high mountains in central Mexico, where the forest canopy
   serves both as a blanket, moderating temperature, and an umbrella,
   shielding the butterflies from rain. In this study we investigated die
   vertical dimension of the butterflies' use of the oyamel forest: we
   predicted that clusters form at the heights above ground that provide
   the greatest protection from freezing. By suspending temperature
   recorders at eight heights, from ground level up to 22m, we established
   two vertical transects in the forest. We set one transect in a densely
   forested area and the other in a thinned area, and we recorded hourly
   temperatures from Jan 13 through Feb 5, 2006. Intermediate heights in
   the forest, from 10 to 15m above ground, remained the warmest during the
   cold night and early morning. We also determined that this temperature
   distribution matched available records of the vertical distribution of
   butterflies roosting in branch and trunk clusters. The vertical
   temperature profiles became uniform during mid-day. Temperature extremes
   were moderated more dining clear than during cloudy periods and more in
   the denser than in the thinned forest. Our results illustrate how the
   monarch butterfly is behaviorally adapted to the three-dimensional
   complexity of microclimate in the yarned forest. A denser forest
   provides better protection for the overwintering survival of monarch
   butterflies than a thinned forest. This research bolsters our other
   microclimatic studies, all of which point to the urgency of prohibiting
   logging within the oyamel forest used as wintering habitat by monarch
   butterflies.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic fluctuations in thermostatted multiparticle collision
   dynamics},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {83},
Number = {4, 2},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {In this work we study the behavior of mesoscopic fluctuations of a fluid
   simulated by Multiparticle Collision Dynamics when this is applied
   together with a local thermostatting procedure that constrains the
   strength of temperature fluctuations. We consider procedures in which
   the thermostat interacts with the fluid at every simulation step as well
   as cases in which the thermostat is applied only at regular time
   intervals. Due to the application of the thermostat temperature
   fluctuations are forced to relax to equilibrium faster than they do in
   the nonthermostatted, constant-energy case. Depending on the interval of
   application of the thermostat, it is demonstrated that the thermodynamic
   state changes gradually from isothermal to adiabatic conditions. In
   order to exhibit this effect we compute from simulations diverse
   correlation functions of the hydrodynamic fluctuating fields. These
   correlation functions are compared with those predicted by a linearized
   hydrodynamic theory of a simple fluid in which a thermostat is applied
   locally. We find a good agreement between the model and the numerical
   results, which confirms that hydrodynamic fluctuations in Multiparticle
   Collision Dynamics in the presence of the thermostat have the properties
   expected for spontaneous fluctuations in fluids in contact with a heat
   reservoir.},

Abstract = {Archived samples from a previously unreported 1958 Stanley Miller
   electric discharge experiment containing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were
   recently discovered and analyzed using high-performance liquid
   chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We report here the
   detection and quantification of primary amine-containing compounds in
   the original sample residues, which were produced via spark discharge
   using a gaseous mixture of H2S, CH4, NH3, and CO2. A total of 23 amino
   acids and 4 amines, including 7 organosulfur compounds, were detected in
   these samples. The major amino acids with chiral centers are racemic
   within the accuracy of the measurements, indicating that they are not
   contaminants introduced during sample storage. This experiment marks the
   first synthesis of sulfur amino acids from spark discharge experiments
   designed to imitate primordial environments. The relative yield of some
   amino acids, in particular the isomers of aminobutyric acid, are the
   highest ever found in a spark discharge experiment. The simulated
   primordial conditions used by Miller may serve as a model for early
   volcanic plume chemistry and provide insight to the possible roles such
   plumes may have played in abiotic organic synthesis. Additionally, the
   overall abundances of the synthesized amino acids in the presence of H2S
   are very similar to the abundances found in some carbonaceous
   meteorites, suggesting that H2S may have played an important role in
   prebiotic reactions in early solar system environments.},

Title = {Amino acid mobilization and growth of juvenile Octopus maya
   (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) under inanition and re-feeding},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {314},
Number = {1-4},

Abstract = {Octopus maya is an endemic cephalopod from the Yucatan Peninsula in
   Mexico, with interest to develop their commercial culture. Like all
   cephalopods, protein is an important nutrient both for growing and
   energetic metabolism. This condition results in a high demand for
   protein and specifically for certain amino acids (AAs). In this study it
   is examined the effects of inanition and re-feeding on growth and AA
   content in soft tissue to detect the amino acid (AA) mobilization to
   identify the principal metabolic reserves in juvenile O. maya. After 25
   days re-feeding of all starved groups, the octopuses were unable to
   reach the similar weight as the control group. However, SCR of some
   groups were greater than that of the controls, although the differences
   were not significant due to variability in the data. Therefore, it is
   assumed that the juveniles of O. maya would need a longer period of time
   to reach the control group. It is therefore demonstrated that juveniles
   of O. maya have a wide plasticity to tolerate, at least 10 days of food
   deprivation without any apparently physiological damage. Moreover,
   during inanition the juveniles of O. maya used preferentially Thr, Phe,
   Ile, Ala, Glu and Set, suggesting a strong mobilization of both
   essential and non essential AA to maintain the homeostasis. Prove of
   that is that survival of the animals during fasting and re-feeding
   period was not affected by treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Many of the studies on biosolids refer to the positive effects of their
   application in crops, but there is little information on the evaluation
   of their effect on the biological component of the edaphic subsystem.
   Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate their
   action on the collembolans in alfalfa and corn crops in the state of
   Aguascalientes. With pitfall traps used in 2004 and 2005, eight species
   were collected, of which Ballistura schoetti, Entomobrya ca.
   triangularis and Seira purpurea were the most abundant. The addition of
   organic matter present in the biosolids propitiated a great population
   development of B. schoetti in both crops. Precipitation was the
   environmental variable best related with the abundance of collembolans,
   species diversity was low in all of the experimental conditions, and the
   species composition was lower in the corn crop.},

   particulate matter (PM) affects health. However, how PM components
   interact with PM-size to cause adverse health effects needs elucidation,
   especially when considering soil and anthropogenic sources. We studied
   PM from Mexicali. Mexico, where soil particles contribute importantly to
   air pollution, expecting to differentiate in vitro effects related to
   PM-size and composition. PM samples with mean aerodynamic diameters <=
   2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and <= 10 mu m (PM10) were collected in Mexicali
   (October 2005-March 2006) from a semi-urban (expected larger
   participation of soil sources) and an urban (predominately combustion
   sources) site. Samples were pooled by site and size, analyzed for
   elemental composition (particle-induced X-ray emission) and tested in
   vitro for: induction of human erythrocytes membrane disruption
   (hemolysis) (colorimetrically); inhibition of cell proliferation (ICP)
   (crystal violet) and TNF alpha/IL-6 secretion (ELISA) using J774.A1
   murine monocytic cells; and DNA degradation using Balb/c3T3 cell naked
   DNA (electrophoretically). Results of PM elemental composition principal
   component analysis were used in associating cellular effects. Sixteen
   elements identified in PM grouped in two principal components:
   Component(1) (C-1): Mg, Al, Si. P. Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V. Cr, Fe, and
   Component(2) (C-2): Cu, Zn. Hemolysis was predominately induced by
   semi-urban-PM10 (p < 0.05) and was associated with urban-PM10 C-1 (r =
   0.62, p = 0.003). Major ICP resulted with semi-urban PM2.5 (p < 0.05).
   TNF alpha, was mainly induced by urban samples regardless of size (p <
   0.05) and associated with urban-PM2.5 C-2 (r = 0.48, p = 0.02). Both
   PM10 samples induced highest DNA degradation (p < 0.05), regardless of
   location. We conclude that PM-size and PM-related soil or anthropogenic
   elements trigger specific biological-response patterns. (C) 2010

Abstract = {To study the effect of feed ration on rearing and nutritional conditions
   of Octopus maya juveniles (7-10 days old), two groups of octopuses were
   fed on 10\% and 30\% rations, using a crab paste agglutinated with
   gelatine, when compared to another control group fed ad libitum on crab
   muscle tissue. The agglutinated diet was well accepted by the octopuses
   at this early stage. When considered together, the marginally higher
   survival of the 30\% group and probably higher levels of the other
   rearing performance parameters (growth and feeding rate) indicate that
   this feed ration is more adequate than a 10\% feed ration for rearing O.
   maya under these conditions. Octopuses fed 30\% also generally showed
   higher total energy per gram of arm tissue and oxygen consumption, as
   well as different proteolytic activity. In addition, the mentioned
   nutritional differences influenced by the feed ration were found to be
   statistically correlated to the promoted growth and the end survival and
   feeding rates.},

   Hypothesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {97},

Abstract = {Host specificity plays an essential role in shaping the evolutionary
   history of host-parasite associations. In this study, an index of host
   specificity recently proposed was used to test, quantitatively, the
   hypothesis that some groups of parasites are characteristics of some
   host fish families along their distribution range. A database with all
   published records on the helminth parasites of freshwater siluriforms of
   Mexico was used. The host specificity index was used considering its
   advantage to measure the taxonomic heterogeneity of the host assemblages
   and its appropriateness for unequal sampling data. The helminth parasite
   fauna of freshwater siluriforms in Mexico seems to be specific for
   different host taxonomic categories. However, a relatively high number
   of species (47\% of the total helminth fauna) is specific to their
   respective host family. This result provides further corroboration for
   the biogeographic hypothesis of the core helminth fauna proposed
   previously. The statistical values for host specificity obtained herein
   seem to be independent of host range. However, the accurate taxonomic
   identification of the parasites is fundamental for the evaluation of
   host specificity and the accurate evolutionary interpretation of this
   phenomenon.},

Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this work we review our new methods to computer generate amorphous
   atomic topologies of several binary alloys: SiH, SiN, CN; binary systems
   based on group IV elements like SiC; the GeSe2 chalcogenide;
   aluminum-based systems: AlN and AlSi, and the CuZr amorphous alloy. We
   use an ab initio approach based on density functionals and
   computationally thermally-randomized periodically-continued cells with
   at least 108 atoms. The computational thermal process to generate the
   amorphous alloys is the undermelt-quench approach, or one of its
   variants, that consists in linearly heating the samples to just below
   their melting (or liquidus) temperatures, and then linearly cooling them
   afterwards. These processes are carried out from initial crystalline
   conditions using short and long time steps. We find that a step
   four-times the default time step is adequate for most of the
   simulations. Radial distribution functions (partial and total) are
   calculated and compared whenever possible with experimental results, and
   the agreement is very good. For some materials we report studies of the
   effect of the topological disorder on their electronic and vibrational
   densities of states and on their optical properties.},

Abstract = {Here, we provide new records of suctorians (Ciliophora: Suctoria),
   epibionts of aquatic true bugs (Hemiptera: Prosorrhyncha: Nepomorpha)

   records as epibionts of 15 species of aquatic true bugs. Only for the
   suctorian Discophrya gessneri Matthes, we confirm the previous record
   (epibiont of Aphelocheirus aestivalis Fabricius). We conclude that the
   relationship between the suctorians and aquatic true bugs is poorly
   studied and some suctorian genera (Discophrya Lachmann and Periacineta
   Collin) inhabit as nepomorphans as other aquatic insects (Coleoptera).
   However the high degree of specificity at the species level of these
   genera is evident, for which we provide some possible explanations
   according to the group of basibiont.},

Abstract = {A photoacoustic technique was used as an alternative method to monitor
   the crater volume and its role in the emission line intensification in
   double-pulse pre-ablation configuration. The crater volume was measured
   using confocal microscopy and correlated with the changes in the
   photoacoustic signal. Laser emission spectroscopy was used to
   characterize the emission enhancement as a function of the delay between
   lasers and the first pulse energy. Optimum delay was found to be in the
   microsecond timescale corresponding to the maximum of the crater volume
   and the largest change between the single-and the double-pulse
   photoacoustic signals. Only a slight intensification was detected with
   increasing first pulse energy above the first pulse ablation threshold;
   however, the crater volume did not significantly change and the possible
   involved mechanisms are discussed.},

Abstract = {The gastropod shell use of the hermit crab Calcinus californiensis was
   studied at Troncones, Guerrero, Mexico. Hermit crabs were captured at
   two different levels of the intertidal zone, in wave-protected and
   wave-exposed sites. C. californiensis occupied shells of 18 gastropod
   species. At both wave-action sites. Cantharus sanguinolentus was the
   most occupied shell. Columbella sp. was used more by females than by
   males, and Nerita scabricosto was more used by males. The frequency of
   use of the shells was different between the different wave sites. N.
   scabricosta and Columbella sp. were occupied more at the wave-protected
   than at the exposed sites; C. sanguinolentus and Stramonita biserialis
   were occupied more at the exposed sites. The hermit crabs at the
   wave-exposed sites occupied heavier and thicker shells compared with the
   crabs from the protected sites. The Olmstead-Tukey diagram showed eight
   shell species as dominant in the wave-protected sites, and seven in the
   wave-exposed sites. Ten shell species were rare in the wave-protected
   sites, and six in the wave-exposed sites. The rare shells occupied by
   the hermit crabs were relatively heavier than the dominant shells in
   both site types. Our results suggest that the shell weight is important
   in sites that are greatly affected by the hydrodynamics.},

   particular, closed partially conformal vector fields in Euclidean spaces
   are associated to the most simple foliations given by hyperspheres,

   The study was carried out using a finished top plate under fixed

Abstract = {Improvement in the osmoregulation capacity via nutritional supplies is
   vitally important in shrimp aquaculture. The effects of dietary protein
   levels on the osmoregulation capacity of the Pacific white shrimp (L.
   vannamei) were investigated. This involved an examination of growth
   performance, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and Na+-K+ ATPase mRNA
   expression,, and GDH activity in muscles and gills. Three experimental
   diets were formulated, containing 25\%, 40\%, and 50\% dietary protein,
   and fed to the shrimp at a salinity of 25. After 20 days, no significant
   difference was observed in weight gain, though GDH and Na+-K+ ATPase
   gene expression and GDH activity increased with higher dietary protein
   levels. Subsequently, shrimp fed diets with 25\% and 50\% dietary
   protein were transferred into tanks with salinities of 38 and 5,
   respectively, and sampled at weeks 1 and 2. Shrimp fed with 40\% protein
   at 25 in salinity (optimal conditions) were used as a control.
   Regardless of the salinities, shrimp fed with 50\% dietary protein had
   significantly higher growth performance than other diets; no significant
   differences were found in comparison with the control. Shrimp fed with
   25\% dietary protein and maintained at salinities of 38 and 5 had
   significantly lower weight gain values after 2 weeks. Ambient salinity
   change also stimulated the hepatosomatic index, which increased in the
   first week and then recovered to a relatively normal level, as in the
   control, after 2 weeks. These findings indicate that in white shrimp,
   the specific protein nutrient and energy demands related to ambient
   salinity change are associated with protein metabolism. Increased
   dietary protein level could improve the osmoreaulation capacity of L.
   vannamei with more energy resources allocated to GDH activity and
   expression.},

Abstract = {Croton guerreroanus (Euphorbiaceae), a new species from Guerrero,
   Mexico, is described and illustrated. During the taxonomic revision for
   the family Euphorbiaceae in the state of Guerrero, Mexico, specimens
   were collected that do not correspond to any known species and it was
   concluded that these represent a new species. This new entity differs
   from the related species in being a shrub 1.5 m tall, with
   stellate-stipitate trichomes. The leaf blades are membranaceous with
   entire margins, and the stipules are foliaceous, 3-10 mm long, reniform
   at the base, and linear at the apex. In addition the pistillate flowers
   have pedicels 2-3 mm long, ovate-oblong sepals with a prominent nerve on
   the abaxial surface, and styles that bifurcate three times.},

Abstract = {Naturally occurring diatomaceous earth was modified by alkaline
   pretreatment, and its effectiveness for Cd2+ removal from contaminated
   water was investigated. Batch experiments were carried out to determine
   Cd2+ adsorption capacity and the efficiency of the sorption process

   fitting to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models. The Cd2+ maximum
   adsorption capacity was 0.058 mmol g(-1) for raw diatomite and increased
   to 0.195 mmol g(-1) for alkaline-pretreated diatomite with efficiency
   higher than 96\% (diatomite dose 2.5 g L-1, pH 6). Adsorption of Cd2+ to
   alkaline-pretreated diatomite increased as the temperature increased.
   Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of
   the adsorption process at different temperatures. The adsorption process
   was spontaneous and endothermic. The interaction between Cd2+ ions and
   diatomite surface was weak enough to be considered as physical sorption,
   confirmed by the low value of activation energy.},

Abstract = {Eudusbabekia paralepidoseta new species, was recorded on the Hart's
   little fruit bat Enchistenes hartii (Thomas) in the southern part of
   Mexico. The female and male are described and illustrated. E.
   paralepidoseta n. sp. represents the 32nd species in the genus. From the
   31 known species of Eudusbabekia known to infest phyllostomid and
   mormoopid bats, E. paralepidoseta n. sp. has some morphological features
   similar to Eudusbabekia lepidoseta Jameson, 1971, including shapes of
   almost all dorsal and ventral setae; the presence of a patch of
   supernumerary; mostly broad to thick, medium, and almost scale-like
   setae; and the absence of setae 2b. However, E. paralepidoseta n. sp.
   can be differentiated from E. lepidoseta, by the reduced number of
   supernumerary setae on the female venter (37-43). The close
   morphological and therefore evolutionary similarities between E.
   lepidoseta and E. paralepidoseta n. sp. suggest possible close
   evolutionary relationships between their hosts, Sturnira lilium
   (Geoffroyi and St.-Hilaire) and E. hartii, which belong to the
   monophyletic subfamily Stenodermatinae.},

Abstract = {The genus Pronura (Collembola: Neanuridae) in South America, with
   descriptions of two new species and a barcode sequence for one of them.
   - In this paper two new species of Pronura from South America are
   described and illustrated. Pronura gaucheri sp. n. from French Guyana
   has setae A, B, C and D of the antennofrontal setal group present; Ocp
   of the ocular group is absent; and a single ordinary microseta is
   present close to the sensilla on dorso-external tubercles of abdominal
   segments I-III. Pronura paraguayana sp. n. from Paraguay has setae A, B
   and D in the antennofrontal setal group (C absent); Ocp of the ocular
   group is present; and two ordinary setae (including one macroseta) are
   present in the dorso-external setal group of abdominal segments I-III.
   In addition to the morphological descriptions, the mitochondrial
   cytochrome c-oxidase subunit I COI sequence (barcode) of Pronura
   gaucheri sp. n. is provided. This the first time that a Collembola
   species is described along with its barcode sequence.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of the Pantomorus-Naupactus complex

Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Abstract = {We undertook the first cladistic analysis of the Pantomorus-Naupactus
   complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from North and Central America,
   based on 35 species and 61 morphological characters, plus 1151 bp of the
   mtDNA COI and Cyt b genes. The morphological and the combined matrices
   analyzed with TNT yielded a single most parsimonious cladogram that
   allows recognition of two main lineages within the Pantomorus-Naupactus
   complex in North and Central America. One is represented by the species
   formerly placed in Phacepholis and the Pantomorus species group II sensu
   Sharp, ranging along the Pacific coast of Central America and Mexico and
   reaching the Great Plains of North America in the United States, yet not
   occurring in South America. The other lineage is represented by the
   species of Naupactus and Pantomorus species group I, with closer
   relationships to the South American species of these genera. The
   Pantomorus group I includes the type species of the genus (P.
   albosignatus Boheman) whereas the Pantomorus group II includes the type
   species of Athetetes Pascoe, 1886 (A. globicollis Pascoe). Based on the
   results of our phylogenetic analysis, we recommend retaining the name
   Pantomorus Schoenherr for most species of the Pantomorus group I, except
   P. stupidus (Boheman) and P. femoratus Sharp which should be transferred
   to Naupactus Dejean. Moreover, we enlarge the previous concept of
   Phacepholis to include most species of the Pantomorus group II, and we
   establish the synonymy of Athetetes Pascoe, 1886 with Phacepholis Horn,
   1876, being the latter the valid name, by priority.},

Title = {Tropical montane cloud forests: Current threats and opportunities for
   their conservation and sustainable management in Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) are among the most threatened
   ecosystems globally in spite of their high strategic value for
   sustainable development due to the key role played by these forests in
   hydrological cycle maintenance and as reservoirs of endemic
   biodiversity. Resources for effective conservation and management
   programs are rarely sufficient, and criteria must be applied to
   prioritise TMCF for conservation action. This paper reports a priority
   analysis of the 13 main regions of TMCF distribution in Mexico, based on
   four criteria: (1) forest quality, (2) threats to forest permanence, (3)
   threats to forest integrity, and (4) opportunities for conservation. Due
   to the diverse socio-environmental conditions of the local communities
   living in Mexican TMCF regions, their associated social characteristics
   were also evaluated to provide a background for the planning of
   conservation actions. A set of indicators was defined for the
   measurement of each criterion. To assign priority values for subregions
   within each main region, an international team of 40 participants
   evaluated all the indicators using multicriteria decision-making
   analysis. This procedure enabled the identification of 15 subregions of
   critical priority, 17 of high priority, and 10 of medium priority; three
   more were not analysed due to lack of information. The evaluation
   revealed a number of subjects that had hitherto been undetected and that
   may prove useful for prioritisation efforts in other regions where TMCF
   is similarly documented and faces equally severe threats. Based on this
   analysis, key recommendations are outlined to advance conservation
   objectives in those TMCF areas that are subjected to high pressure on
   forest resources. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Stable and unstable regimes in higher-dimensional convex billiards with
   cylindrical shape},
Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {We introduce a class of convex, higher-dimensional billiard models that
   generalize stadium billiards. These models correspond to the free motion
   of a point particle in a region bounded by cylinders cut by planes. They
   are motivated by models of particles interacting via a string-type
   mechanism, and confined by hard walls. The combination of these elements
   may give rise to a defocusing mechanism, similar to that in two
   dimensions, which allows large chaotic regions in phase space. The
   remaining part of phase space is associated with marginally stable
   behaviour. In fact periodic orbits in these systems generically come in
   continuous parametric families, associated with a pair of parabolic
   eigendirections: the periodic orbits are unstable in the presence of a
   defocusing mechanism, but are marginally stable otherwise. By performing
   stability analysis of families of periodic orbits at a nonlinear level,
   we establish the conditions under which families are nonlinearly stable
   or unstable. As a result, we identify regions in the parameter space of
   the models that admit nonlinearly stable oscillations in the form of
   whispering gallery modes. Where no families of periodic orbits are
   stable, the billiards are completely chaotic, i.e. the Lyapunov
   exponents of the billiard map are non-zero.},

   studied in order to find the regimes in which it exhibits normal
   diffusion. In this regime, we calculate numerically the transition
   probabilities between cells to compare the persistent random-walk

Abstract = {High resolution experimental data for resonant soft x-ray scattering of
   transition metal compounds are shown. The compounds studied are the
   ionic transition metal di-fluorides, ionic and covalent orthovanadates
   and members of the La1-xSrxCoO3 perovskite family. In all compounds we
   studied the transition metal L-2,L-3 edge and also the ligand (oxygen or
   fluorine) K edge. For the ionic compounds the transition metal data are
   in good agreement with atomic multiplet ligand field calculations that
   include charge transfer effects. Density functional calculations give
   very useful information to interpret the ligand x-ray emission data. The
   experimental metal L-alpha emission data show that the region between
   valence and conduction bands in the di-fluorides has several d-excited
   states. At the L-2 edge of the ionic orthovanadates we found the
   signature of a fast Coster-Kronig decay process that results in a very
   localized emission peak. Changes in the oxidation sate in the
   La1-xSrxCoO3 compounds are observed at both the metal L-2,L-3 edge and
   the oxygen K edge absorption spectra.},

Title = {The phylogeny of advanced snakes (Colubroidea), with discovery of a new

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The superfamily Colubroidea (> 2500 species) includes the majority of
   snake species and is one of the most conspicuous and well-known
   radiations of terrestrial vertebrates. However, many aspects of the
   phylogeny of the group remain contentious, and dozens of genera have yet
   to be included in molecular phylogenetic analyses. We present a new,
   large-scale, likelihood-based phylogeny for the colubroids, including
   761 species sampled for up to five genes: cytochrome b (93\% of 761
   species sampled), ND4 (69\%), ND2 (28\%), c-mos (54\%), and RAG-1
   (13\%), totaling up to 5814 bp per species. We also compare likelihood
   bootstrapping and a recently proposed ultra-fast measure of branch
   support (Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like {[}SHL] approximate likelihood ratio),
   and find that the SHL test shows strong support for several clades that
   were weakly-supported by bootstrapping in this or previous analyses
   (e.g., Dipsadinae, Lamprophiidae). We find that SHL values are
   positively related to branch lengths, but show stronger support for
   shorter branches than bootstrapping. Despite extensive missing data for
   many taxa (mean = 67\% per species), neither bootstrap nor SHL support
   values for terminal species are related to their incompleteness, and
   that most highly incomplete taxa are placed in the expected families
   from previous taxonomy, typically with very strong support. The
   phylogeny indicates that the Neotropical colubrine genus
   Scaphiodontophis represents an unexpectedly ancient lineage within
   Colubridae. We present a revised higher-level classification of
   Colubroidea, which includes a new subfamily for Scaphiodontophis
   (Scaphiodontophiinae). Our study provides the most comprehensive
   phylogeny of Colubroidea to date, and suggests that SHL values may
   provide a useful complement to bootstrapping for estimating support on
   likelihood-based trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal propagules in soils from a tropical forest and an

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at comparing the number of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) propagules found in soil from a mature tropical
   forest and that found in an abandoned cornfield in Noh-Bec Quintana Roo,
   Mexico, during three seasons. Agricultural practices can dramatically
   reduce the availability and viability of AMF propagules, and in this way
   delay the regeneration of tropical forests in abandoned agricultural
   areas. In addition, rainfall seasonality, which characterizes deciduous
   tropical forests, may strongly influence AMF propagules density. To
   compare AMF propagule numbers between sites and seasons (summer rainy,
   winter rainy and dry season), a ``most probable number{''} (MPN)
   bioassay was conducted under greenhouse conditions employing Sorgum
   vulgare L. as host plant. Results showed an average value of 3.5 +/-
   0.41 propagules in 50 ml of soil for the mature forest while the
   abandoned cornfield had 15.4 +/- 5.03 propagules in 50 ml of soil.
   Likelihood analysis showed no statistical differences in MPN of
   propagules between seasons within each site, or between sites, except
   for the summer rainy season for which soil from the abandoned cornfield
   had eight times as many propagules compared to soil from the mature
   forest site for this season. Propagules of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   remained viable throughout the sampling seasons at both sites. Abandoned
   areas resulting from traditional slash and burn agriculture practices
   involving maize did not show a lower number of AMF propagules, which
   should allow the establishment of mycotrophic plants thus maintaining

Title = {Oogenesis of Microlecithal Oocytes in the Viviparous Teleost
   Heterandria formosa},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {272},
Number = {2},
Pages = {241-257},

Abstract = {Viviparous teleosts exhibit two patterns of embryonic nutrition:
   lecithotrophy (when nutrients are derived from yolk that is deposited in
   the oocyte during oogenesis) and matrotrophy (when nutrients are derived
   from the maternal blood stream during gestation). Nutrients contained in
   oocytes of matrotrophic species are not sufficient to support embryonic
   development until term. The smallest oocytes formed among the viviparous
   poeciliid fish occur in the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, these
   having diameters of only 400 pm. Accordingly, H. formosa presents the
   highest level of matrotrophy among poeciliids. This study provides
   histological details occurring during development of its microlecithal
   oocytes. Five stages occur during oogenesis: oogonial proliferation,
   chromatin nucleolus, primary growth (previtellogenesis), secondary
   growth (vitellogenesis), and oocyte maturation. H. formosa, as in all
   viviparous poeciliids, has intrafollicular fertilization and gestation.
   Therefore, there is no ovulation stage. The full-grown oocyte of H.
   formosa contains a large oil globule, which occupies most of the cell
   volume. The oocyte periphery contains the germinal vesicle, and ooplasm
   that includes cortical alveoli, small oil droplets and only a few yolk
   globules. The follicular cell layer is initially composed of a single
   layer of squamous cells during early previtellogenesis, but these become
   columnar during early vitellogenesis. They are pseudostratified during
   late vitellogenesis and reduce their height becoming almost squamous in
   full-grown oocytes. The microlecithal oocytes of H. formosa represent an
   extreme in fish oogenesis typified by scarce yolk deposition, a
   characteristic directly related to matrotrophy. J. Morphol. 272:241-257,

Abstract = {We consider metric f(R) theories of gravity without mapping them to
   their scalar-tensor counterpart, but using the Ricci scalar itself as an
   ``extra'' degree of freedom. This approach avoids then the introduction
   of a scalar-field potential that might be ill defined (not single
   valued). In order to explicitly show the usefulness of this method, we
   focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes and deal with the
   recent controversy about the existence of extended relativistic objects

Title = {Anti-hyperglycemic effect of Opuntia streptacantha Lem},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {133},
Number = {2},
Pages = {940-943},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Aim of the study: This experiment studied two extracts of Opuntia
   streptacantha, a plant used by the Mexican population to treat type 2
   diabetes, in different assays to contribute to the understanding of the
   hypoglycemic mechanism of this plant.
   Materials and methods: Two different extracts were prepared and tested:
   the first extract was a filtrate of the traditional liquefied extract
   (LE) preparation of the cladode; and the second filtrate extract (FE) is
   a filtered sample of the first. Both extracts contained a newly
   identified compound for Opuntia (4-hydroxy)-phenyl acetic acid derivate,
   they were tested on streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats in a series of
   two tests. The first test was performed to confirm if STZ-diabetic rats
   presented a hypoglycemic effect after administration of the extracts (LE
   135 mg/kg and FE 27 mg/kg). In the second experiment, the extracts were
   administered before an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm if
   they have an anti-hyperglycemic effect (LE 135 mg/kg, FE 12 and 27
   mg/kg).
   Results: The extracts administered to STZ-diabetic rats did not produce
   a significant hypoglycemic effect compared to the control group, while
   the same extracts administered before an OGTT produced an
   anti-hyperglycemic effect compared to the control group.
   Conclusions: The filtered, traditional LE of the cladode of Opuntia
   streptacantha produces an anti-hyperglycemic effect when administered
   before a glucose challenge, and this anti-hyperglycemic effect is
   maintained after filtering the extract. Administration of both plants
   can improve glycemic control by blocking the hepatic glucose output,
   especially in the fasting state. These data support the traditional use
   of the plants as ``agua de uso{''}, a cold infusion of the plant
   consumed over the course of a day. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {Uniqueness of the Fock quantization of fields with unitary dynamics in
   nonstationary spacetimes},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {The Fock quantization of fields propagating in cosmological spacetimes
   is not uniquely determined because of several reasons. Apart from the
   ambiguity in the choice of the quantum representation of the canonical
   commutation relations, there also exists a certain freedom in the choice
   of field: one can scale it arbitrarily absorbing background functions,
   which are spatially homogeneous but depend on time. Each nontrivial
   scaling turns out into a different dynamics and, in general, into an
   inequivalent quantum field theory. In this work we analyze this freedom
   at the quantum level for a scalar field in a nonstationary, homogeneous
   spacetime whose spatial sections have S-3 topology. A scaling of the
   configuration variable is introduced as part of a linear, time dependent
   canonical transformation in phase space. In this context, we prove in
   full detail a uniqueness result about the Fock quantization requiring
   that the dynamics be unitary and the spatial symmetries of the field
   equations have a natural unitary implementation. The main conclusion is
   that, with those requirements, only one particular canonical
   transformation is allowed, and thus only one choice of the
   field-momentum pair (up to irrelevant constant scalings). This
   complements another previous uniqueness result for scalar fields with a
   time varying mass on S-3, which selects a specific equivalence class of
   Fock representations of the canonical commutation relations under the
   conditions of a unitary evolution and the invariance of the vacuum under
   the background symmetries. In total, the combination of these two
   different statements of uniqueness picks up a unique Fock quantization
   for the system. We also extend our proof of uniqueness to other compact
   topologies and spacetime dimensions.},

Abstract = {The mathematical model for the dynamics of the hepatitis C proposed in
   Avendano et al. (2002), with four populations (healthy and unhealthy
   hepatocytes, the viral load of the hepatitis C virus, and T killer
   cells), is revised. Showing that the reduced model obtained by
   considering only the first three of these populations, known as basic
   model, has two possible equilibrium states: the uninfected one where
   viruses are not present in the individual, and the endemic one where
   viruses and infected cells are present. A threshold parameter (the basic
   reproductive virus number) is introduced, and in terms of it, the global
   stability of both two possible equilibrium states is established. Other
   central result consists in showing, by model numerical simulations, the
   feasibility of monitoring liver damage caused by HCV, avoiding
   unnecessary biopsies and the undesirable related
   inconveniences/imponderables to the patient; another result gives a
   mathematical modelling basis to recently developed techniques for the
   disease assessment based essentially on viral load measurements.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological field studies are indispensable for identifying
   plants that can be selected for their pharmacological effects and
   chemical composition. Although the subjective interpretation of results
   by the researcher is crucial, quantitative data analysis is a useful
   tool to identify the most promising pharmacological plants. It has been
   stated that such semi-quantitative information increases the likelihood
   of finding promising ethnopharmacological leads, but so far no critical
   review has assessed what standards best meet the requirements of
   biomedical research. Systematic database searches using SCOPUS, Science
   Direct, Web of Knowledge, Science Citation Index, and Medline with the
   keywords ``ethnobotany,{''} ``ethnopharmacology,{''} ``index,{''} and
   ``consensus{''} in research from the last 5 years form the basis of the
   current analysis, which identifies particularly useful tools like factor
   of informant consensus, fidelity level, use-value, and relative
   importance. A key feature for further field studies is that they should
   provide clear information on a range of topics like; detailed data of
   the importance of these resources within a culture, data of the uses of
   the species, how and where the plants are collected, drying and storage
   processes, preparation method, used doses, and administration. In
   addition, they must include a collection of records about how the people
   feel after the plant use, disappearance of specific symptoms and
   possible side effects.},

Journal = {GAYANA BOTANICA},

Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {16-22},
Abstract = {Lycophytes are the most ancient lineage of vascular plants and include
   Lycopodiaceae, Isoetaceae and Selaginellaceae. They are a monophyletic
   group separated from ferns and seed plants and are especially useful for
   establishing biogeographic patterns, due to their lack of coevolutionary
   relationships with biotic vectors, their monophyly and their remarkable
   morphological conservatism. The individual tracks of the seven taxa of
   lycophytes from central Argentina were drawn and the generalized track
   obtained shows that the central hills of Argentina are the austral
   extreme of the distribution of a Neotropical biotic component, with
   closer relationships with the Subandean hills and the Bolivian and
   Peruvian Andes than to the Chaco (where they are included), bordering
   the South American Transition Zone. The latter is characterized by arid
   environments and is a successful barrier for Lycophytes, separating the
   austral region of Argentina and Chile from the other parts of South
   America.},

   the test of cylindrical parabolic concentrators when the screens are
   designed using dot color changes to guarantee a better dot
   correspondence assignment and to make the optical test of the
   concentrator easier; the method allows to measure deformations from
   tenths of a millimeter to several millimeters, thus demonstrating that
   null screen method is good enough for testing surfaces with important
   deformations. On a second approximation, it is designed a null screen
   corresponding to the surface evaluated with the first one by fitting a
   fourth grade polynomial with crossed terms; with this, it is shown that
   the first test gets closer to the shape of the surface validating it.},

Title = {Accommodating Heterogenous Rates of Evolution in Molecular Divergence
   Dating Methods: An Example Using Intercontinental Dispersal of
   Plestiodon (Eumeces) Lizards},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-15},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Identifying and dating historical biological events is a fundamental
   goal of evolutionary biology, and recent analytical advances permit the
   modeling of factors known to affect both the accuracy and the precision
   of molecular date estimates. As the use of multilocus data sets becomes
   increasingly routine, it becomes more important to evaluate the
   potentially confounding effects of rate heterogeneity both within (e.g.,
   codon positions) and among loci when estimating divergence times. Here,
   using Plestiodon lizards as a test case, we examine the effects of
   accommodating rate heterogeneity among data partitions on divergence
   time estimation. Plestiodon inhabits both East Asia and North America,
   yet both the geographic origin of the genus and timing of dispersal
   between the continents have been debated. For each of the eight
   independently evolving loci and a combined data set, we conduct single
   model and partitioned analyses. We found that extreme saturation has
   obscured the underlying rate of evolution in the mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA), resulting in severe underestimation of the rate in this locus.
   As a result, the age of the crown Plestiodon clade was overestimated by
   15-17 Myr by the unpartitioned analysis of the combined loci data.
   However, the application of partition-specific models to the combined
   data resulted in ages that were fully congruent with those inferred by
   the individual nuclear loci. Although partitioning improved divergence
   date estimates of the mtDNA-only analysis, the ages were nonetheless
   overestimated, thus indicating an inadequacy of our current models to
   capture the complex nature of mtDNA evolution in over large time scales.
   Finally, the statistically incongruent age distributions inferred by the
   partitioned and unpartitioned analyses of the combined data support
   mutually exclusive hypotheses of the timing of intercontinental
   dispersal of Plestiodon from Asia to North America. Analyses that best
   capture the rate of evolution in the combined data set infer that this
   exchange occurred via Beringia similar to 18.0-30 Ma.},

   From this equation one can deduce a non-standard dispersion relation for

Abstract = {P>Matrix projection models are among the most widely used tools in plant
   ecology. However, the way in which plant ecologists use and interpret
   these models differs from the way in which they are presented in the
   broader academic literature. In contrast to calls from earlier reviews,
   most studies of plant populations are based on < 5 matrices and present
   simple metrics such as deterministic population growth rates. However,
   plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model
   predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing
   quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are not the way in which
   plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful. Improving
   forecasting ability would necessitate increased model complexity and
   longer studies. Therefore, in addition to longer term studies with
   better links to environmental drivers, priorities for research include
   critically evaluating relative/comparative uses of matrix models and
   asking how we can use many short-term studies to understand long-term
   population dynamics.},

   SPECIES PLESTIODON BREVIROSTRIS (SQUAMATA: SCINCIDAE)},
Journal = {HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {25-51},
Abstract = {The Mexican Plestiodon brevirostris species group (Squamata: Scincidae)
   is composed of seven nominal species. The wide-ranging P. brevirostris
   is a polytypic species composed of live subspecies: P. brevirostris, P.
   b. bilineatus, P. b. dicei. P. b. indubitus, and P. b pineus. A
   tree-based approach for species delimitation with mtDNA data was used to
   test the traditional species-level toxonomy of P. brevirostris
   preliminarily. A haplotype phylogeny for all of the species and
   subspecies in the P. brevirostris group, except P. colimensis., was
   inferred. The mtDNA data consisted of sequences encompassing the genes
   encoding 16S rRNA (part), ND1, and associated tRNAs (1355 base pairs),
   which were analyzed with Bayesian methods. Then, a search for diagnostic
   morphological characters for the putative species delimited by this
   approach was performed. The results indicate that the P. brevirostris
   group is paraphyletic with respect to P. lynxe, and that P. brevirostris
   actually is composed of at least five distinct lineages disguised by
   traditional taxonomy: P I). brevirostris. P. b. bilineatus, P. b. dicei,
   and the eastern populations of P. b indubitus (from Morelos, Guerrero,
   and Mexico) represent distinct species, whereas the western populations
   of P. b. indubitus (from Colima and Jalisco) represent an undescribed
   species. The data. cannot resolve whether P. b. pineus is conspecific
   with P. b. diem or P. b. dicei is it paraphyletic ( =nonexclusive)
   species relative to an exclusive P. b. plum's. Thus, the status of P. b.
   pineus remains uncertain. The haplotype phylogeny also suggests that P.
   b. brevirostris may represent inure than one species.},

Title = {FUNCTIONAL BISPORANGIATE CONES IN PINUS JOHANNIS (PINACEAE):
   IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF BISEXUALITY IN SEED PLANTS},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1},
Pages = {130-139},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Premise of study : Bisexuality (male and female function in one
   structure) has been reported as a key innovation of angiosperms.
   Although there are several reports of ``teratological{''} bisporangiate
   (bisexual) cones in gymnosperms, there have been none on the viability
   of their ovules and pollen. Analyses of the development and arrangement
   of female and male structures on bisporangiate cones of Pinus johannis
   enables us to gain insight on the origin of bisexuality in seed plants,
   for both angiosperms and gymnosperms.
   Methods : Viability of bisporangiate cones was assayed by performing
   manual crosses and using anatomical and histological methods.
   Key results : We determined that bisporangiate cones of P. johannis
   produce functional pollen and ovules. Male and female organs occupy
   basal and apical positions, respectively, the same positions found in
   almost all bisporangiate strobili in gymnosperms and bisexual flowers in
   angiosperms.
   Conclusions : The viability and spatial distribution of female and male
   organs of bisporangiate cones and their frequent occurrence in
   gymnosperms suggest a common mechanism in all seed plants for the
   production of bisporangiate structures. This idea is further supported
   by the presence of homologous genes for sexual organ identity in
   gymnosperms and angiosperms as reported by other authors. The lack of
   bisporangiate structure in gymnosperms may be primarily due to selection
   to avoid inbreeding rather than to genetic constraint.},

Abstract = {The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942 is a
   unicellular, obligate photoautotroph that represents a model organism
   for studies of photosynthesis, circadian rhythm, cell division and
   carbon-concentrating mechanisms. The recently completed sequencing of
   its genome gives the opportunity to attempt a reconstruction of a
   genome-scale computational model of its metabolic processes. Towards
   this goal, we are currently refining the annotation of this
   microorganism relaying mostly on primary scientific literature and aided
   by information from various biological databases (KEGG, Brenda, TCDB).
   Until now, we were able to newly identify or to confirm 351 connections
   linking a particular gene to its molecular function, which constitute
   approximately 13.5\% of protein coding genes of this cyanobacterium.
   Once the refinement is finished, we will perform a constraint -based
   analysis to assess metabolic capabilities, including growth yield and
   gene essentiality, and to predict a minimal photoautotrophic cell.},

Abstract = {The Chihuahuan Desert (CD), the largest in the Americas, is flanked by
   mountains that prevent wet winds from blowing across it; those mountain
   ranges are the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt
   and the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, and the Rockies in the United
   States. The desert covers an area of 507,000 km2, stretching from New
   Mexico and Texas in the United States to parts of the states of
   Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Nuevo Leon,
   Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas in Mexico. Field
   work consisted of the qualitative characterization of the main
   vegetation types in the CH, based on their physiognomy and the
   collection of plant specimens for later identification. With the
   composition and physiognomy data, semi-realistic profiles were made of
   the main plant associations and the physiographic and soil conditions
   where they thrive. The associations detected were: Larrea tridentata
   microphyll scrub, Agave lechuguilla rosette scrub, Dasylirion spp.

   each zero-dimensional closed subset A of X and for each p is an element
   of X \textbackslash{} A, there exists a subcontinuum M of X such that p

Abstract = {Juvenile growth rate is an important life-history trait that affects the
   size at maturity, and may influence the development of sexual
   ornamentation. The sword of several species of the genus Xiphophorus
   (Teleostei: Poeciliidae) is an elaborate secondary sexual trait that
   confers an advantage in terms of sexual selection, counterbalanced by
   locomotive and predatory costs. This study assesses differences in male
   juvenile growth, age, and size at maturation and their relationship with
   maximum body size and sword elongation in Montezuma swordtails
   (Xiphophorus montezumae). Fish size and sword length were measured over
   the course of 20 months. The size at which individual males initiated
   sword elongation varied considerably among individuals. Male maximum
   body size was correlated with early growth rate and age of maturation,
   and sword growth rate was positively correlated with male size at the
   onset of sword growth. Early growth in X. montezumae may provide
   valuable information about performance in subsequent stages and about
   probable future reproductive},

Abstract = {Important aspects of chaotic behavior appear in systems of low
   dimension, as illustrated by the Map Module 1. It is indeed a remarkable
   fact that all systems tha make a transition from order to disorder
   display common properties, irrespective of their exacta functional form.
   We discuss evidence for 1/f power spectra in the chaotic time series
   associated in classical and quantum examples, the one-dimensional map
   module 1 and the spectrum of Ca-48.
   A Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) method is applied to investigate
   the scaling properties of the energy fluctuations in the spectrum of
   Ca-48 obtained with a large realistic shell model calculation (ANTOINE
   code) and with a random shell model (TBRE) calculation also in the time
   series obtained with the map mod 1. We compare the scale invariant
   properties of the Ca-48 nuclear spectrum sith similar analyses applied
   to the RMT ensambles GOE and GDE. A comparison with the corresponding
   power spectra is made in both cases. The possible consequences of the
   results are discussed.},

Title = {SALINITY, TEMPERATURE, AND SEASONALITY EFFECTS ON THE METABOLIC RATE OF
   THE BROWN SHRIMP FARFANTEPENAEUS AZTECUS (IVES, 1891) (DECAPODA,
   PENAEIDAE) FROM THE COASTAL GULF OF MEXICO},

Pages = {1547-1560},
Abstract = {The routine metabolic rate (QO(2) in mg O-2 g(-1) DW h(-1)) was measured
   in juveniles of the brown shrimp, Farfantepenaeus aztecus (Ives, 1891)
   at salinity and temperature ranges prevailing during the cold and warm
   seasons at the coastal lagoon of Tamiahua, Veracruz, Mexico. A
   semi-closed respirometer was employed, with eight 4-L experimental
   chambers, each containing two shrimp of similar size and sex. The shrimp
   were fasting and in the intermoult stage, and acclimated to the chambers
   for 12 h prior to determining oxygen consumption. Oxygen measurements
   were taken every two hours with a partial replacement of water and
   aeration of one hour between readings. In a 24 h cycle, 6 to 8
   measurements were made. Relations between QO(2) and DW, for the
   different salinity and temperature conditions tested, were calculated
   and adjusted to the equation: QO(2) = alpha DW beta. Two-way ANOVA was
   applied to analyse the effect of salinity, temperature, time of day, and
   body weight on F. aztecus QO(2). Salinity had no significant (p > 0.05)
   effect upon the shrimp's routine metabolic rate at intervals of 26 to 34
   psu and 22 to 36 psu, typical of the cold and warm seasons,
   respectively. However, seasonal temperature variation did significantly
   affect the shrimp's QO(2), thus suggesting the existence of a different
   ``pattern of acclimatization{''} in the energy requirements of the
   individuals from both seasons. The results indicate that the population
   of F. aztecus from this area of the Gulf of Mexico may represent a
   ``cline{''}, the physiological response of the components of which
   differs from that of other brown shrimp populations distributed over a
   wide geographical range in the western tropical Atlantic.},

Abstract = {Valle de Bravo reservoir is used for aquatic, fishing and as a source of
   drinking water to Mexico City. Annual data on composition, abundances,
   species richness and diversity of the phytoplankton surface community
   and some physical-chemical parameters variations were discussed. Results
   showed a spatial homogeneity for environmental descriptors and
   phytoplankton samples but a temporal significant difference between
   months. Pulses of high algal densities corresponded to late
   stratification (October, 103 x 10(3) cell ml(-1)), early stratification
   (April, 107 x 10(3) cell ml(-1)) and plenty stratification (June, 69 x
   10(3) cell ml(-1)). Taxa that reached higher densities were: Microcystis
   spp., Snowella septentrionalis, Anabaena spp., Aphanizomenon yezoense
   and Fragilaria crotonensis. Contribution of each taxon to the total
   phytoplankton density showed that majorities were rare (41\%) or
   dominants (40\%). Frequent alternation between pulses and low densities
   and diversity of phytoplankton as well as a relative high number of taxa
   found (68), could be explained by daily strong winds, unstable
   epilimnion thickness and incorporation and extraction of substantial
   volumes of water occurred in the reservoir. Dominances of cyanobacteria
   and some chlorococcal species and a high temporal fluctuated
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index (0.45-2.35 bits) pointing to eutrophic
   and perturbed conditions.},

Title = {Cytological ontogeny of the digestive gland in post-hatching Octopus
   maya, and cytological background of digestion in juveniles},
Journal = {AQUATIC BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The cephalopod digestive gland (DG) is responsible for enzyme production
   as well as nutrient and lipid storage. Octopus maya (Mollusca:
   Cephalopoda) is a holobenthic octopus species with aquaculture
   potential. To develop a balanced food for the rearing of this octopus,
   it is necessary to understand its digestive physiology. We performed
   histological studies on the structural change of the DG (cytological
   ontogeny) associated with age (from 0 to 30 d posthatching, DPH) and
   food (postprandial change in 120 DPH juveniles). Early ontogeny of DG
   was defined in 3 stages: (1) yolk platelets stage (0 to 5 DPH), (2)
   transition stage (6 to 10 DPH) and (3) heterolysosomes (food reserves)
   stage (>12 DPH). In Stage 1, the DG had anatomically undifferentiated
   tubules, but was filled with yolk platelets. The tubular structures
   developed lumen by 5 DPH. Stage 2 (starting at 6 DPH) corresponds to
   mixed exogenous and endogenous feeding. At that time, the yolk platelets
   were gradually consumed until completely exhausted at 9 DPH. At the
   onset of Stage 3, the DG structure was completely tubular, exhibiting
   digestive cell microvilli and other cellular features typical to octupus
   DGs. During exogenous feeding (12 DPH and onward), acidophilic secretory
   lysosomes, heterolysosomes and some heterophagosomes appeared on DG
   cells. O. maya has long digestive cycles in which the extracellular and
   intracellular digestion can take up to 8 h. Although the ecological
   implications of this information for aquaculture will still have to be
   proven, results demonstrated that O. maya is an energetically efficient
   species and thus suitable for rearing in captivity.},

Abstract = {The Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve (REPSA) is located in the
   central campus of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), in
   Mexico City. Diversity and abundance of edaphic mites of the order
   Mesostigmata were estimated in two sites of REPSA. One site had scanty
   vegetation, due to human alterations, and was designated as ``open
   site{''} (O), whereas the other had less altered, denser vegetation,
   being designated as ``closed site{''} (C). Samples of soil and litter
   collected during the rainy and dry seasons of 2008 were processed for
   the extraction of mites of that group, which were then mounted and
   quantified by morphospecies. Mite abundance was much higher in site O,
   but the number of morphospecies was about the same in both sites. The
   same mite families were found in both sites. For each season and for
   both seasons considered together, Shannon diversity and Pielou's
   evenness indexes were significantly higher in site C. Sorensen
   similarity coefficient between sites was high in both seasons, but
   higher in the dry season; considering both seasons together, similarity
   coefficient between sites was 94\%. This indicates that anthropogenic
   alteration of the vegetation at REPSA, reducing the height of the
   vegetation and turning it less dense, was not sufficient to cause major
   alterations in Mesostigmata species composition.},

Abstract = {Analyses of richness and endemism of Cyatheales (tree ferns) in tropical
   America were performed and evidence of a diversity gradient is
   presented. For this, the occurrence ranges of 239 species were plotted
   into a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid-cell map and then analyzed using
   species richness and endemism indices. Here we show that species
   richness and endemism are not distributed randomly over the landscape,
   but do aggregate into defined regions of high diversity in tropical
   America: the northern Andes, lower Central America, upper Central
   America and Mexico, the Guyana Highlands, southeastern Brazil, and the
   Antilles. These distributional patterns are congruent with the
   geographical distribution of cloud forest, which in turn is determined
   by topography, high humidity, and persistent cloud immersion. The
   mountain regions of tropical America, especially the cloud forests,
   harbour most of the species of American Cyatheales and have high levels
   of habitat loss and climatic fragility. Conservation policies for
   Cyatheales are centred on the local use and trade of many tree fern
   species, but none such policies focus on cloud forest habitat loss. This
   makes tree ferns a critically endangered group of plants. In the face of
   the current environmental crisis and global climate change, the presence
   of Cyatheales in these regions sounds the alarm on their conservation
   priorities.},

Journal = {PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {231-240},
Abstract = {Mexico counts among the five countries with the highest biodiversity in
   the world. In the Yucatan Peninsula, there arc aquatic ecosystems with a
   very special microbial diversity These ecosystems are essential for the
   ecological equilibrium of the region, and are seriously threatened by
   human activities. Access and knowledge of the microbial resources of
   these environments have an enormous scientific interest, and could
   potentially result in biotechnological products which could lead to more
   efficient and environmentally friendly processes; it could also offer a
   full arsenal of microorganisms and/or novel molecules to the local and
   world industry to face the current needs. In recent years, with the rise
   of metagenomic technology, knowledge about microbial diversity in
   complex communities has started to develop astonishingly fast. This is
   because of the use of molecular methods which do not require culturing
   microorganisms in artificial media. Through DGGE, FISH, and TRFLP
   assays, 454 sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and functional analysis of
   metagenomic libraries, high-level scientific studies are being performed
   not only in microbiology, but also in other areas of knowledge. The
   results obtained thus far show that we are barely starting to perceive
   the enormous diversity present in the environments. The study and use of
   these resources claim for a high priority in the scientific policies of
   our country, and of other countries with which synergistic
   collaborations could be set up.},

Title = {MPK6, sphinganine and the LCB2a gene from serine

   cell death induced by long chain bases in Arabidopsis},
Journal = {NEW PHYTOLOGIST},

Pages = {943-957},
Abstract = {Long chain bases (LCBs) are sphingolipid intermediates acting as second
   messengers in programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. Most of the
   molecular and cellular features of this signaling function remain
   unknown.
   We induced PCD conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and analyzed
   LCB accumulation kinetics, cell ultrastructure and phenotypes in serine
   palmitoyltransferase (spt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (mpk),
   mitogen-activated protein phosphatase (mkp1) and lcb-hydroxylase (sbh)
   mutants.
   The lcb2a-1 mutant was unable to mount an effective PCD in response to
   fumonisin B1 (FB1), revealing that the LCB2a gene is essential for the
   induction of PCD. The accumulation kinetics of LCBs in wild-type (WT)
   and lcb2a-1 plants and reconstitution experiments with sphinganine
   indicated that this LCB was primarily responsible for PCD elicitation.
   The resistance of the null mpk6 mutant to manifest PCD on FB1 and
   sphinganine addition and the failure to show resistance on pathogen
   infection and MPK6 activation by FB1 and LCBs indicated that MPK6
   mediates PCD downstream of LCBs.
   This work describes MPK6 as a novel transducer in the pathway leading to
   LCB-induced PCD in Arabidopsis, and reveals that sphinganine and the
   LCB2a gene are required in a PCD process that operates as one of the
   more effective strategies used as defense against pathogens in plants.},

Title = {Auto-ignition of methane-air mixtures flowing along an array of thin

Abstract = {In this paper, the heterogeneous ignition of a methane-air mixture
   flowing along an infinite array of catalytic parallel plates has been
   studied by inclusion of gas expansion effects and the finite heat
   conduction on the plates. The system of equations considers the full
   compressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the energy equations
   of the plates. The gas expansion effects which arise from temperature
   changes have been considered. The heterogeneous kinetics considers the
   adsorption and desorption reactions for both reactants. The limits of
   large and small longitudinal thermal conductance of the plate material
   are analyzed and the critical conditions for ignition are obtained in
   closed form. The governing equations are solved numerically using finite
   differences. The results show that ignition is more easily produced as
   the longitudinal wall thermal conductance increases, and the effects of
   the gas expansion on the catalytic ignition process are rather small due
   to the large value of the activation energy of the desorption reaction
   of adsorbed oxygen atoms.},

Title = {New Synthesis Method to Obtain Pd Nano-Crystals},

Volume = {14},
Pages = {95-105},
Abstract = {We report a new synthesis method to obtain palladium nano-crystals by
   sol-gel polymerized with acrylamide. From thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA) studies, we found PdO and Pd compounds in the xerogel sample, at
   550 degrees C, and over 900 degrees C we detected only metallic Pd.
   These results were corroborated by powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), High
   Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HRSEM), and Transmission
   Electron Microscopy (TEM). XRD studies exhibit the lines from the
   tetragonal structure (PDF 41-1107) of PdO compound and from the cubic
   structure (PDF 46-1043) of Pd metallic. HRSEM micrographs show
   morphologies from the sample very sensitive to heat treatment. Finally,
   TEM images show crystals of similar to 8 nm in diameter.},

Abstract = {In this work, we use a mathematical model for dengue transmission with
   the aim of analysing and comparing two dengue epidemics that occurred in
   Salvador, Brazil, in 1995-1996 and 2002. Using real data, we obtain the
   force of infection, L, and the basic reproductive number, R(0), for both
   epidemics. We also obtain the time evolution of the effective
   reproduction number, R(t), which results in a very suitable measure to
   compare the patterns of both epidemics. Based on the analysis of the
   behaviour of R(0) and R(t) in relation to the adult mosquito control
   parameter of the model, we show that the control applied only to the
   adult stage of the mosquito population is not sufficient to stop dengue
   transmission, emphasizing the importance of applying the control to the
   aquatic phase of the mosquito.},

Abstract = {The Nearctic has been recognized as a biogeographic region since the
   19th century. We analyzed distributional patterns of the mammals
   inhabiting North and Central America, from Alaska to Panama, to delimit
   the boundaries of the Nearctic region. We performed 6 optimality
   analyses, using a grid of 4 latitude-longitude, based on families,
   genera, species, and combinations of these. The analysis of the matrix
   with the 3 taxonomic levels yielded better results in terms of the
   largest number of endemics and the best delimitation of the Nearctic
   region. We also found 3 patterns western, eastern, and northern within
   the region that coincide partially with previous biogeographic
   characterizations. Although mammals seem to represent appropriate taxa
   to delimit this region, we conclude that a more robust delimitation
   might be obtained by analyzing other plant and animal taxa. DOE:

Abstract = {Neutral fragment products from dissociative collisions of triatomic
   hydrogen like ions incident on He atoms were studied. Absolute
   differential and total cross sections are reported here in the energy
   range of 1.00-5.00 keV and scattering angles between -5.0 degrees and
   5.0 degrees. The differential cross sections show decreasing behaviour
   with a slight structure around 2.0 degrees. The total cross sections for
   all triatomic molecular ions studied in this work are found to be
   comparable for the same velocity (E/M). The measured cross sections are
   between 0.7 x 10(-17) cm(2) and 0.9 x 10(-16) cm(2). The present results
   for the neutral total cross section correlate very well with previously
   measured total ions cross section for H-3(+), D-3(+) and HD2+ on He.},

Abstract = {Using data for 25,780 species categorized on the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature Red List, we present an assessment of the status
   of the world's vertebrates. One-fifth of species are classified as
   Threatened, and we show that this figure is increasing: On average, 52
   species of mammals, birds, and amphibians move one category closer to
   extinction each year. However, this overall pattern conceals the impact
   of conservation successes, and we show that the rate of deterioration
   would have been at least one-fifth again as much in the absence of
   these. Nonetheless, current conservation efforts remain insufficient to
   offset the main drivers of biodiversity loss in these groups:
   agricultural expansion, logging, overexploitation, and invasive alien
   species.},

Abstract = {The helminth parasite fauna of 2 species of freshwater fishes from the
   upper Piaxtla River in northwestern Mexico was studied. A total of 41
   cyprinids, corresponding to 20 Campostoma ornatum and 21 Codoma ornata
   were analyzed. Six species of platyhelminths were recorded, including 2
   species of monogeneans (Gyrodactylus sp. and Dactylogyrus sp.), 3
   species of digeneans (Posthodiplostomum minimum, Clinostomum
   complanatum, and Margotrema sp.), and 1 species of tapeworm
   (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi). Helminth parasite infracommunities were
   depauperate, showed low richness and diversity values, and were
   dominated by 1 or 2 helminth species. This pattern is consistent with
   that observed for the helminth parasite communities in other freshwater
   fishes in central and northern Mexico.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of species richness of Quercus in Mexico is incomplete due
   mainly to its wide distribution, high intra-species morphological
   variability and its capacity for forming hybrids, making taxonomy of the
   genus difficult. The objective of the present study was to examine the
   floristic composition of species of genus Quercus in Los Marmoles
   National Park (PNM) and their distribution in the study area. This park
   is the second-largest natural protected area in the state of Hidalgo,
   Mexico. Specimens of oak were collected at 36 sites along elevation
   gradients. Identification of the material enabled recognition of 18
   species of oak growing in the park, including Quercus furfuracea Liebm.,
   recorded for the first time in the state of Hidalgo. The species with
   the greatest distribution in the park were Quercus affinis Scheidw., Q.
   crassifolia Humb. and Bonpl., Q. laeta Liebm. and Q. mexicana Bonpl.
   Knowledge of oak species richness and distribution can serve as a
   reference for the establishment of forest management and conservation
   programs in the PNM.},

Abstract = {Structure and floristic composition of a temperate forest of the Sierra
   Madre Occidental (SMO), in the state of Durango, Mexico, were analyzed
   in order to characterize the different plant strata. The study area is
   located at El Durangueno Ranch, with vegetation representative of the
   eastern slopes of the SMO. The area includes 3 dominant vegetation
   types: oak-pine forest, pine-oak forest and grassland. Floristic
   composition corresponds to semidry temperate forests and in smaller
   proportion to humid temperate forests of northern Mexico. Structural
   characteristics indicate that the sites present great heterogeneity, 26
   species of grasslands, 31 in the oak-pine and 22 in the pine-oak, with
   the stratum under which presented more species 76. The trees are medium
   sized and the densities are similar to other sites of this mountain
   range. Oak-pine forests have the highest values of diversity and were
   similar to those registered in other areas of the SMO. There are 12
   species endemic to Mexico, from which 6 are endemic to the SMO, and
   Psacalium cronquistiorum B.L. Turner (Asteraceae) is endemic of Durango.
   Seven species are included in the Red list of the IUCN. Grasslands have
   high floristic richness, combining species typical of the grasslands of
   lower elevations with species of temperate forests. Although there is no
   reference to fires in the forests of the area, the wide distribution of
   Quercus striatula scrub may indicate disturbance attributed to fires in
   the recent past.},

Title = {Benthic algal communities of some sources of the Oliva-Pego marsh,
   Valencia, Spain},
Journal = {LIMNETICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {287-299},

Abstract = {The Oliva-Pego marsh is an important rice and citrus growing area in the
   Spanish Levant. The marsh is situated in the area of maximal rainfall of
   the Autonomous Community of Valencia and has high temperatures
   year-round. This marsh presents a conductivity gradient that goes from
   fresh water to brackish in its main inflowing streams, which gives way
   to a large variety of macro and microalgae, that form characteristic
   groups in the different conditions. Several of these species show
   tropical affinity.
   The results of two samplings in 1999 are presented, which were carried
   out in the most contrasting environmental zones-those of minimum and
   maximum rainfall. In each sampling site (four water bodies: Bullent
   River, Ullal River close to the Bullent, Bassa Sineu and the Font
   Sallat) pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen,
   current velocity, depth, and cationic and anionic contents of the water
   were assessed.
   The communities studied were constituted by structural species of
   Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Diatoms were the most diverse group,
   while Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae formed the visible elements. As
   structural elements, the presence of Homoeothrix juliana (Meneghini)
   Kirchner and Schizothrix fasciculata (Nageli) Gomont was to be noteed in
   oligohaline waters and Chaetophorales, Phormidium tenue (Meneghini)
   Gomont, Calothrix pulvinata Kutzing and Pleurocapsales in slightly
   brackish waters.
   The diatoms Encyonopsis microcephala Grunow Krammer, Cymbella affinis
   Kutzing and Navicula cryptotenella Lange-Bertalot were responsible for
   their chlorophyll c contribution in two streams (Rio Bullent and Ullal),
   while Hyalodiscus whitneyi Ehrenberg. Nitzschia gracilis Hantzsch,
   Navicella pusilla (Grunow) Krammer and Cocconeis placentula var.
   euglypta (Ehrenberg) Grunow were responsible in Font Salat, and
   Rhoicosphenia abbreviata (C. Agardh) Lange-Bertalot was responsible in
   Bassa Sineu. Characteristic communities of the different degrees of
   water salinity were observed in the different water bodies, composed of
   species with affinity for those conditions.
   The sources in the marsh are fundamental as consistent providers of
   water, with a constancy in the species within the community. This is why
   they can be used as equilibrium indicators of the system, in order to
   understand the combined effects of salinity and water regime on marsh
   biodiversity. This information is important as an environmental referent
   for water policies and legislative measures with water quality
   indicators of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European
   Community (EC), and offers a precedent for the improvement of ecological
   quality of both freshwater and marine systems.},

Abstract = {The diversity of freshwater Ascomycetes was determined in the touristic
   channel Santa Cruz, Xochimilco, Mexico. Two surveys were conducted in
   2007 during the dry and wet season. Four sampling sites were selected in
   the channel margin, based on the level of urbanization. At each sampling
   site, wood panels of Tabebuia donnell-smithii, Bucida buceras, Pinus
   sp., Cupressus lindlei and Abies religiosa were submerged during 8
   weeks. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, organic matter, phosphorus
   and most probable number of coliform bacteria were determined. Results
   were evaluated using the diversity index of Shannon and the index of
   similarity of Sorensen. The highest Ascomycete diversity recorded (H' =
   1.152) was found at the third sampling site, located near commercial
   florist greenhouses. The lowest diversity (H' = 0.976) was obtained at
   the first sampling site, in front of Santa Cruz pier. Both values of
   diversity were in agreement with the urbanization level and
   physicochemical and bacteriological data. The wet season had the lowest
   diversity of freshwater Ascomycetes, perhaps due to the effect of the
   rainfall in this aquatic environment.},

Abstract = {To demonstrate that parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) can be a
   method implementing the panbiogeographic approach, we analyzed two data
   matrices of 40/38 biogeographic provinces x 148 plant species from the
   Caribbean subregion of the Neotropical region, one where taxa are
   represented by individual tracks and the other where taxa are
   represented by single sample localities. We obtained six generalized
   tracks resulted from the PAE of the areas x individual tracks matrix,
   and one generalized track from the PAE of the areas x single sample
   localities matrix, with the latter nested within the former tracks. The
   results obtained show that PAE works as a panbiogeographical tool if it
   is based on an areas x individual tracks matrix. When performed in this
   way, PAE retrieves spatial information that is lost when it is based on
   an areas x single sample localities matrix, raising doubts regarding the
   conclusions derived from this latter type of analysis. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Patagonian
   octopus fed with moist diets formulated with several local feed
   ingredients. All formulated diets were based on crab paste (70\%) and
   the experimental feed ingredient (30\%). Experiment I assayed salmon
   meal, prime sardine meal, and wheat gluten, using fresh fish as a
   control; experiment 2 assayed prime fish meal and macroalgal meal
   against crab paste alone as a control. The ingestion rate was lower than
   expected for all diets except those of fresh fish, crab paste alone, and
   crab paste plus prime sardine meal. No significant differences were
   found in the observed digestibility of the diets, indicating, in
   general, low digestibility, even for fresh fish. The highest protease
   values were observed for crab paste plus prime sardine meal in both
   experiments. The better growth of Enteroctopus. megalocyathus was
   obtained when these were fed fresh fish, which was associated with the
   greater consumption observed in this diet, as neither the digestibility
   nor the enzymatic activities of the hepatopancreas were related to this
   greater growth.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the genetic structure of the tropical tree Dendropanax
   arboreus (Araliaceae) in relation to habitat fragmentation. Genetic
   variation, structure, and genetic differentiation among populations from
   Los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest were estimated using ISSRs as molecular
   markers. DNA from 219 individuals belonging to 9 populations was
   amplified with 4 primers yielding a total of 75 loci. Adults and
   juveniles from each population were analyzed to assess the genetic
   diversity and structure pre and post-fragmentation, respectively.
   Dendropanax arboreus showed high levels of genetic diversity (h = 0.253)
   and significant but low genetic differentiation among populations (0 =
   0.062). A hierarchical analysis of the gvenetic structure showed that
   91.5\% of the genetic variation is attributable to individual
   differences within populations. The average Nei's genetic distance among
   populations was low (D = 0.034) and genetic distance among pairs of
   populations increased with geographic distance separating them. Because
   genetic diversity is similar between adult and juvenile trees at all but
   2 populations, we suggest that seed dispersal prevented genetic
   differentiation and maintains genetic connectivity among fragments and
   continuous forest populations. Juvenile populations showed a higher
   genetic differentiation (theta = 0.15) than adult trees, indicating a
   role of genetic drift via reduced population size.},

Abstract = {Recent development of digital soil mapping (DSM) allowed improving
   significantly the quality of soil maps. We tried to make a set of
   empirical models for the territory of Karelia, a republic at the
   North-East of the European territory of Russian Federation. This
   territory was selected for the pilot study for DSM for two reasons.
   First, the soils of the region are mainly monogenetic; thus, the effect
   of paleogeographic environment on recent soils is reduced. Second, the
   territory was poorly mapped because of low agricultural development:
   only 1.8\% of the total area of the republic is used for agriculture and
   has large-scale soil maps. The rest of the territory has only
   small-scale soil maps, compiled basing on the general geographic
   concepts rather than on field surveys. Thus, the only solution for soil
   inventory was the predictive digital mapping. The absence of
   large-scaled soil maps did not allow data mining from previous soil
   surveys, and only empirical models could be applied. For regionalization
   purposes, we accepted the division into Northern and Southern Karelia,
   proposed in the general scheme of soil regionalization of Russia;
   boundaries between the regions were somewhat modified. Within each
   region, we specified from 15 (Northern Karelia) to 32 (Southern Karelia)
   individual soilscapes and proposed soil-topographic and
   soil-lithological relationships for every soilscape. Further field
   verification is needed to adjust the models.},

Abstract = {The Squalid Callista Megapitaria squalida is one of the most important
   bivalve fisheries in Baja California Sur. However, there is scarce
   information about the current state of the fishery. In order to obtain
   an overview of the fishery development, spatial and temporal catch
   trends were analyzed. The analysis was based on monthly and by area
   catches records from 1999 to 2006. Results show six major fishing areas:
   La Paz Bay, Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, Magdalena Bay, San Ignacio Lagoon,
   Loreto and Santa Rosalia. In the first three areas it was observed 96\%
   of the total catch. There was a general increase in catches from 1992
   (315 t) to 2002 (1,128 t) due to the catch increase in Ojo de Liebre
   Lagoon and La Paz Bay. However, a substantial catch decline occurred in
   Magdalena Bay from 2001 (457 t) to 2006 (73 t). Since 2002 there has
   been a general catch decline. Therefore, the conclusion of the study
   affirms that the fisheries in La Paz Bay and Ojo de Liebre Lagoon are at
   their maximum level of exploitation. In Magdalena Bay there is evidence
   of overfishing, while San Ignacio Lagoon, Loreto and Santa Rosalia could
   have developing potential. A detailed stock assessment is recommended
   due to the recent negative catch trends that could indicate an excessive
   fishing pressure.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the growth and early survival of two congeneric
   columnar cacti the rare Neobuxbaumia macrocephala (with low population
   densities and a narrow distribution range), and the relatively common
   Neobuxbaumia mezcalaensis (with dense populations and a broader
   distribution range). Seeds of both species were germinated and seedlings
   were subjected to different radiation, nutrient and watering treatments
   in greenhouse conditions for six months By the end of the experiment
   seedling average dry mass was similar in both species. Recently emerged
   seedlings of N macrocephala were smaller than those of N mezcalaensis,
   however. N macrocephala showed higher relative growth rates (average RGR
   = 0.0138 mg/mg/day) than N mezcalaensis (average RGR = 0.0126
   mg/mg/day). For both species RGR decreased in the shade Root shoot ratio
   (R/S) and K were higher in N. mezcalaensis than in N. macrocephala and
   showed an increasing trend as water availability decreased. Seedling
   survival was followed in natural conditions for nine months. The
   survival of N mezcalaensis was significantly higher compared to N.
   macrocephala. In both species a slightly higher seedling survival was
   observed under the shade of nurse plants The two species displayed
   different growth and survival responses, which accounts to some extent
   for their contrasting level of rarity (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights

Abstract = {Our group is interested in rRNA and ribosome biogenesis in the parasitic
   protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Epimastigotes represent an extracellular
   replicative stage of T. cruzi and can be cultured in axenic media. The
   growth curve of epimastigotes allows assessment of potential differences
   in the nucleoli of cells undergoing growth-rate transitions. To
   establish cellular parameters for studying ribosome biogenesis in T.
   cruzi, a morphometric analysis of the nucleoli of cultured cells in the
   exponential and stationary phases was conducted. Electron
   micrograph-based measurements of nuclear sections from independent cells
   demonstrated that the nucleolar area is over twofold higher in
   exponentially growing cells, as compared with epimastigotes in the
   stationary phase. The granular component of the nucleoli of actively
   growing cells was the main structural element. Cycloheximide moderately
   reduced the apparent size of the nucleoli without an apparent disruption
   of their architecture. Our results provide a firm basis for the
   establishment of an experimental model to study the organization of the
   nucleolus during the growth and development of T. cruzi.},

Abstract = {The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of captivity upon
   morphological characteristics and body growth rates of the Morelet's
   crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii). The studied individuals are currently
   reared in the Management Unit for Wildlife Conservation (Cacahuatal),
   located at Veracruz, Mexico. Four populations were compared: individuals
   from 2 of them were born in wild conditions, whereas individuals from
   the other 2, were born in captivity. Morphology was similar among
   populations and between sexes. Body growth rates were significantly
   different among populations, those individuals born in natural
   conditions grew faster than those born in captivity. We conclude that
   captivity does not seem to affect the morphological expression of C.
   moreletii in comparison with a significant effect upon the rate of body
   growth. These results show that different populations of C. moreletii
   can exhibit differential body growth patterns depending on the
   conditions experienced in captivity.},

Title = {Lactoferrin increases both resistance to Salmonella typhimurium

Journal = {IMMUNOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {134},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Lactoferrin (Lf) is a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein with
   antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities The antibacterial
   influence of orally administered bovine Lf (bLf) against murine
   infection caused by Salmonella typhimurium (S typhimurium) has scarcely
   been explored In the current study Balb/c mice were treated orally for 7
   days with either 5 or 100 mg of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) On day 7 of
   treatment mice were intragastrically infected with a lethal or sublethal
   dose of colony forming units (CFU) of S typhimurium During treatment
   with bLf feces from mice sublethally Infected were harvested daily to
   prepare fecal suspensions which were serially diluted and plated onto
   Salmonella Shigella agar to estimate CFU/g of feces After sacrificing
   the animals on day 7 14 or 21 post-infection samples of intestinal fluid
   Peyer s patches (PP) liver and spleen were collected to count the number
   of CFU by plate dilution Intestinal secretions were also employed along
   with serum samples to evaluate total IgA IgG and IgM antibodies and
   those against Salmonella surface proteins and bLf by ELISA assay In
   lethally infected mice both bLf doses decreased mortality In sublethally
   infected mice both bLf doses decreased bacterial shedding in feces and
   intestinal fluid and also reduced bacterial colonization at PP and
   bacterial translocation in the liver and spleen Levels of total and
   those IgG and IgM in serum and IgA in intestinal secretions against
   Salmonella surface proteins and bLf were enhanced with both doses of bLf
   These findings suggest that the effect of bLf against the infection by S
   typhimurium in mice may be the result of an antimicrobial activity
   linked with its modulatory effect on immunocompetent cells (from
   intestinal and peripheral organs) involved in antibody production (C)

   expressed in terms of its Hurst exponent (H-PDF), which correlated
   significantly with the soil dielectric permittivity and gravimetric
   water content, as well as with micro-horizon depth and the temporal
   progress of drying. We documented an intermittent character of the water
   content dynamics, correlating with oscillations of the pore/solid
   interface roughness. Our technique of PDF roughness analysis of digital
   images, exemplified here for soil moisture monitoring, can be applied
   for monitoring the other complex systems, for instance plant growth in

Title = {B-Function Expression in the Flower Center Underlies the Homeotic
   Phenotype of Lacandonia schismatica (Triuridaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT CELL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Spontaneous homeotic transformations have been described in natural
   populations of both plants and animals, but little is known about the
   molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying these processes in plants. In
   the ABC model of floral organ identity in Arabidopsis thaliana, the
   B-and C-functions are necessary for stamen morphogenesis, and C alone is
   required for carpel identity. We provide ABC model-based
   molecular-genetic evidence that explains the unique inside-out homeotic
   floral organ arrangement of the monocotyledonous mycoheterotroph species
   Lacandonia schismatica (Triuridaceae) from Mexico. Whereas a quarter
   million flowering plant species bear central carpels surrounded by
   stamens, L. schismatica stamens occur in the center of the flower and
   are surrounded by carpels. The simplest explanation for this is that the
   B-function is displaced toward the flower center. Our analyses of the
   spatio-temporal pattern of B-and C-function gene expression are
   consistent with this hypothesis. The hypothesis is further supported by
   conservation between the B-function genes of L. schismatica and
   Arabidopsis, as the former are able to rescue stamens in Arabidopsis
   transgenic complementation lines, and Ls-AP3 and Ls-PI are able to
   interact with each other and with the corresponding Arabidopsis
   B-function proteins in yeast. Thus, relatively simple molecular
   modifications may underlie important morphological shifts in natural
   populations of extant plant taxa.},

Funding-Text = {This article is dedicated to the indigenous and peasant communities
   settled in the Mexican Lacandon rainforest, on whose well-being the
   conservation of this unique and diverse ecosystem depends. We hope this
   article calls attention to the importance of supporting these poor
   communities and the conservation of the Lacandon rainforest. The
   Frontera Corozal Cho'l community, as well as the Lacandon people, are
   acknowledged for authorizations and help during L. schismatica
   collection trips over the last 13 years. Special thanks to Ambrosio and
   his family and to Don Pascual for all their help and guidance while
   searching for L. schismatica populations. We thank John L. Bowman for
   discussions and help in the lab and field work and Stefan de Folter for
   advice and materials for the yeast assays. Rigoberto Vicencio Perez-Ruiz
   helped with various laboratory tasks and Diana Romo with logistical

Abstract = {We sequenced 1869 bp of mtDNA (cyt b and ND2) from 80 specimens of
   Lepidocolaptes affinis, a montane bird species of Mesoamerica, sampled
   at 34 localities from Mexico to Costa Rica. The species showed moderate
   genetic diversity (pi = 0.0045) and phylogeographic structure (Phi(ST) =
   0.12-0.95). The phylogeographic pattern indicated the Nicaragua
   Depression has prevented gene flow whereas populations on the two sides
   of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec did not show strong genetic
   differentiation. In Mexico, the population of the Sierra Madre Oriental
   was composed of two different lineages. In general, our data did not
   support a scenario of historical demographic expansion, and matched
   partially the phylogeographic patterns of other Mesoamerica montane
   species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   of a collar that is restricted to move in a path defined by a rod of
   some prescribed form which passes through the collar. We generalize the
   analysis of this system by means of canonical treatment. We show in this
   way that this excellent example can also be used in advanced courses on
   mechanics to show the power of the methods of analytical mechanics. We
   have that the present treatment of this example will be useful for
   advanced undergraduate and graduate students as well as for the teachers
   of these courses on classical mechanics.},

   the Colegio de Postgraduados Campus Montecillo, Texcoco, estado de
   Mexico. An Andersen sampler one stage for fungal spore and a data logger
   Pendant (R) series (Onset (c) Co.) for registering temperature and light
   were used. Fungal identification was performed to the genus level with
   and without plants. Alternaria, Cladosporium, Epiccocum, Fusarium and
   Penicillium were the predominant genera obtained; but Aspergillus niger
   and A. candidus were also found. Aerial spore levels decreased by 60\%
   in plants presence and temperature increased between 2 and 3 degrees C
   in the three rooms sampled. No significant differences for light
   intensity were observed by plants presence. There was a clear behaviour
   between the intensity of light and the position of the indoor
   environments. The results showed that in the presence of plants and
   increasing the indoor temperature, the concentration of fungi in the air
   decreased.},

   beta-diacetoxy-12,22-dioxo-5 alpha-cholestan-26-yl
   beta-D-glucopyranoside starting from hecogenin is described. This
   compound showed anti-cancer activity against cervicouterine cancer cells
   HeLa. CaSki and ViBo in the micromolar range. Its effect on cell
   proliferation, cell cycle and cell death is also described. The
   cytotoxic effect of the title compound on HeLa, CaSki and ViBo cells and
   human lymphocytes was evaluated through the LDH released in the culture
   supernatant, indicating that the main cell death process is not
   necrosis; the null effect on lymphocytes implies that it is not
   cytotoxic. The ability of this novel glycoside to induce apoptosis was
   investigated; several apoptosis events like chromatin condensation,
   formation of apoptotic bodies, as well as the increase in the expression
   of active caspase-3 and the fragmentation of DNA confirmed that the
   compound induced apoptosis in cervicouterine cancer cells.
   Significantly, the antiproliferative activity on tumor cells did not
   affect the proliferative potential of normal fibroblasts from cervix and
   peripheral blood lymphocytes. The glycoside showed selective antitumor
   activity and greater antiproliferative activity than its aglycon; it
   therefore serves as a promising lead candidate for further optimization.

Abstract = {In this paper we provide an explicit probability distribution for
   classification purposes when observations are viewed on the real line
   and classifications are to be based on numerical orderings. The
   classification model is derived from a Bayesian nonparametric mixture of
   Dirichlet process model; with some modifications. The resulting approach
   then more closely resembles a classical hierarchical grouping rule in
   that it depends on sums of squares of neighboring values. The proposed
   probability model for classification relies on a numerical procedure
   based on a reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for
   determining the probabilities. Some numerical illustrations comparing
   with alternative ideas for classification are provided.},

Abstract = {Rationale: Fibrocytes are progenitor cells characterized by the
   simultaneous expression of mesenchymal, monocyte, and hematopoietic stem
   cell markers. We previously documented their presence in lungs of
   patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the mechanisms
   involved in their migration, subsequent homing, and local role remain
   unclear. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) facilitate cell migration and
   have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.
   Objectives: To evaluate the expression and role of matrix
   metalloproteinases in human fibrocytes.
   Methods: Fibrocytes were purified from CD14(+) monocytes and cultured
   for 8 days; purity of fibrocyte cultures was 95\% or greater as
   determined by flow cytometry. Conditioned media and total RNA were
   collected and the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-8, and MMP-9
   was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein synthesis
   was examined using a Multiplex assay, Western blot, fluorescent
   immunocytochemistry, and confocal microscopy. MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic
   activities were evaluated by gelatin zymography. Migration was assessed
   using collagen I-coated Boyden chambers. Stromal cell-derived factor-1
   alpha and platelet-derived growth factor-B were used as chemoattractant
   with or without a specific MMP-8 inhibitor.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fibrocytes showed gene and protein
   expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-8, and MMP-7. MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic
   activities were also demonstrated by gelatin zymography. Likewise, we
   found colocalization of MMP-8 and MMP-7 with type I collagen in
   fibrocytes. Fibrocyte migration toward platelet-derived growth factor-B
   or Stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha in collagen I-coated Boyden
   chambers was significantly reduced by a specific MMP-8 inhibitor.
   Conclusions: Our findings reveal that fibrocytes express a variety of
   MMPs and that MMP-8 actively participates in the process of fibrocyte
   migration.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic variation of traits can reflect the ability of plants to
   adjust to particular environments, but how much of this variation is
   heritable is not frequently analyzed in natural populations. In the
   present paper, we investigated the patterns of phenotypic expression in
   light-related leaf traits of Olea europaea subsp. guanchica, a woody
   sclerophyllous species endemic to the Canary Islands. We explored
   phenotypic differentiation and heritable variation across several island
   populations differing in light environment. A suite of morpho-functional
   (leaf size, SLA and leaf angle) and physiological (pigment pools: Chl
   a/b ratio, xantophyll cycle and beta-carotene) traits was measured in
   six populations on three islands. In addition, we estimated
   heritabilities for these traits following Ritland's method. Variation in
   morpho-functional, but not in physiological, traits was observed across
   the islands and was significantly related to the amount of diffuse light
   experienced by each population. In addition, significant heritabilities
   were found for morpho-functional traits, whereas expression of similar
   phenotypes among populations was accompanied by a lack of heritable
   variation in physiological traits. Most recently established populations
   did not exhibit lower heritabilities in quantitative traits than older
   populations, and apparently displayed congruent phenotypes under the
   local conditions. Our results strongly support the idea that different
   types of traits show contrasted levels of genetic and phenotypic
   variation in populations experiencing marked environmental differences.},

Abstract = {Non-doped and lithium doped nickel oxide crystalline films have been
   prepared onto quartz and crystalline alumina substrates at high
   substrate temperature (600 degrees C) by the pneumatic spray pyrolysis
   process using nickel and lithium acetates as source materials. The
   structure of all the deposited films was the crystalline cubic phase
   related to NiO, although this crystalline structure was a little bit
   stressed for the films with higher lithium concentration. The grain size
   had values between 60 and 70 nm, almost independently of doping
   concentration. The non-doped and lithium doped films have an energy band
   gap of the order of 3.6 eV. Hot point probe results show that all
   deposited films have a p-type semiconductor behavior. From
   current-voltage measurements it was observed that the electrical
   resistivity decreases as the lithium concentration increases, indicating
   that the doping action of lithium is carried out. The electrical
   resistivity changed from 10(6) Omega cm for the non-doped films up to
   10(2) Omega cm for the films prepared with the highest doping
   concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {164},

Abstract = {We explore processes of seed immigration and seedling recruitment before
   an experimental rainforest restoration matures enough to affect either.
   Twenty-four 30 x 30-m plots were fenced in 12 ha of pasture in 2006.
   Seeds were collected in ninety-six 1-m(-2) seed traps; recruits were
   censused in similar to 12,000 m(2) in which establishment was allowed.
   We tested effects of distance from forest, living trees, and stumps of
   trees cut during site preparation on seed rain in 2007 and effects of
   these and soil depth on recruits through June 2008. Seed fall and
   recruitment were not correlated with distance to forest 90-400 m away,
   nor to living shade trees outside the 160 x 485-m experimental grid.
   Recruitment differed for animal- and wind-dispersed species in a
   topographically complex landscape. Recruitment of wind-dispersed species
   was random with respect to soil depth or distance to recent stumps.
   Recruitment of animal-dispersed species was multimodal; partial
   correlations with number of stumps within 30 m of plots were significant
   with soil depth held constant (P < 0.025), as were correlations of
   recruitment with soil depth with number of stumps held constant (P <
   0.01). Animal-dispersed recruits were often not conspecifics of adults
   that had been cut, indicating a legacy of attraction by fruiting trees
   of animals bearing seeds from distant sources. Ecological implications
   are that recruitment in pastures released from grazing reflects a mix of
   widely scattered wind-dispersed pioneers and, where animal-dispersed
   trees exist, multi-modal and decidedly non-random recruitment of pioneer
   and later successional animal-dispersed trees from seed banks.},

Abstract = {The Mexican four eyed octopus Octopus maya is an endemic species of the
   Yucatan Peninsula, and supports an important fishery. No divergent
   stocks have been identified and so at present this species has been
   managed as a single homogeneous population. To contribute to management
   optimization of the fishery, through the identification of genetically
   variable stocks, we investigated the variability of four microsatellite
   loci in samples of O. maya individuals from three localities in the
   Yucatan Peninsula: (1) Seybaplaya in the State of Campeche: (2)Sisal and
   (3) El Cuyo in the State of Yucatan. We calculated F-ST and F-IS
   indices, checked for departures from Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium
   expectations within localities, and calculated Nei genetic distances
   between localities. Average F-IS was -0.026, although animals from El
   Cuyo showed positive values. In addition, animals from El Cuyo showed
   heterozygote deficits in two loci and some inbreeding, while those from
   Sisal and Seybaplaya were in H-W equilibrium. Genetic distances between
   animals from different localities ranged from 1.9 to 5.5\%, larger than
   those previously calculated from allozyme data. Although these results
   are preliminary with respect to a potential modification of the fishery
   management regime, they support the idea that, to a certain extent,
   animals from different localities differ genetically. This calls for
   wider population surveys, using species-specific microsatellites. (C)

Abstract = {Pyrimethamine is an antimalarial drug that has also been used
   successfully to treat autoimmune diseases such as lymphoproliferative
   syndrome. In this work, the effect of pyrimethamine (PYR) on the
   production of free radicals in malaria-infected mice was studied to
   better understand the drug's immunomodulatory properties. BALB/c and
   CBA/Ca mice were infected with Plasmodium yoelii 17XL. Seven days after
   infection, mice were treated with PYR or vehicle and sacrificed 24 h
   later. Treatment with PYR increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione
   peroxidase activities in erythrocytes and the liver, augmented the
   levels of nitric oxide in the serum, and upregulated mRNA levels of
   superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and iNOS in the
   spleen. In addition, PYR increased lipoperoxidation and protein
   carbonylation in infected mice. Our results indicate that P. yoelii 17XL
   reduces oxidative stress in infected cells, while PYR induces it, which
   is associated with increased parasite elimination. Thus, it is possible
   that oxidative stress generated by pyrimethamine is also involved in its
   immunomodulatory mechanism of action. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Acoustic communication through whistles is well developed in dolphins.
   However, little is known on how dolphins are using whistles because
   localizing the sound source is not an easy task. In the present study,
   the hyperbola method was used to localize the sound source using a
   two-hydrophone array. A combined visual and acoustic method was used to
   determine the identity of the whistling dolphin. In an aquarium in
   Mexico City where two adult bottlenose dolphins were housed we recorded
   946 whistles during 22 days. We found that a dolphin was located along
   the calculated hyperbola for 72.9\% of the whistles, but only for 60.3\%
   of the whistles could we determine the identity of the whistling
   dolphin. However, sometimes it was possible to use other cues to
   identify the whistling dolphin. It could be the animal that performed a
   behavior named ``observation{''} at the time whistling occurred or, when
   a whistle was only recorded on one channel, the whistling dolphin could
   be the animal located closest to the hydrophone that captured the
   whistle. Using these cues, 15.4\% of the whistles were further ascribed
   to either dolphin to obtain an overall identification efficiency of
   75.7\%. Our results show that a very simple and inexpensive acoustic
   setup can lead to a reasonable number of identifications of the captive
   whistling dolphin: this is the first study to report such a high rate of
   whistles identified to the free swimming, captive dolphin that produced
   them. Therefore, we have a data set with which we can investigate how
   dolphins are using whistles. This method can be applied in other aquaria
   where a small number of dolphins is housed; though, the actual
   efficiency of this method will depend on how often dolphins spend time
   next to each other and on the reverberation conditions of the pool. (C)

Abstract = {The physiological, anatomical and optical leaf properties relative to
   photosynthetically active (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation were
   assessed in Ticodendron incognitum, Drimys granadensis, Podocarpus
   matudae var. macrocarpus and Vaccinium consanguineum, growing along an
   elevation gradient (1520 2550 m asl) in a montane cloud forest in
   Mexico. PAR and UV-B absorptance, transmittance and reflectance, UV-B
   absorptance by foliar compounds, chlorophylls, carotenoids, leaf
   nitrogen, leaf mass per area, leaf blades, cuticles, epidermis and
   parenchymas thickness were measured. PAR absorptance efficiencies were
   calculated. Among the evaluated morpho-functional traits, the studied
   species displayed different patterns of variation with elevation. Leaf
   traits could be explained in part by changes in elevation or the
   distribution of PAR and UV-B in the elevation gradient. Ticodendron and
   Drimys leaf traits were likely determined by two cloud banks located at
   1940 and 2380 m. In Vaccinium, eight traits were related to elevation
   and PAR or UV-B. Contrary to this, in Podocarpus, most of the nine leaf
   traits could be explained by only one of these factors. The
   morphological traits of the studied species were similar to those of
   species growing in other oligotrophic ecosystems. Significant
   differences between sun exposed and shade leaves were limited to
   particular elevations or to particular traits of each species. Vaccinium
   showed more significant differences between sun and shade leaves than
   did the other species growing along the gradient. The morpho-functional
   traits measured in Podocarpus and Vaccinium showed that, some leaf
   traits did not change linearly with elevation or PAR. At elevation
   levels where species co-occur, the species ranking with respect to
   evaluated traits varied from trait to trait. This indicate that each
   species copes with light and other environmental factors, that vary with
   elevation, according to its morpho-functional plasticity and
   susceptibility to these factors; which may determine the distribution of
   these species along the gradient. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {Let T be a 3-partite tournament. We say that a vertex u is (C-3) over
   right arrow -free if v does not lie on any directed triangle of T. Let
   F-3 (T) be the set of the (C-3) over right arrow -free vertices in a
   3-partite tournament and f(3)(T) its cardinality. In this paper we prove
   that if T is a regular 3-partite tournament, then F-3 (T) must be
   contained in one of the partite sets of T. It is also shown that for
   every regular 3-partite tournament, f(3)(T) does not exceed n/9, where n
   is the order of T. On the other hand, we give an infinite family of
   strongly connected tournaments having n - 4 (C-3) over right arrow -free
   vertices. Finally we prove that for every c >= 3 there exists an
   infinite family of strongly connected c-partite tournaments, D-c(T),

Abstract = {This study involved the production of naringinase by twelve filamentous
   fungi in solid-state fermentation (SSF) using orange and grapefruit rind
   as substrates; these agro industrial residues contain naringin, an
   important inductor for this enzyme. The percentage of naringin
   hydrolyzed from grapefruit rind by Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus
   niger and Aspergillus niger HPD-2 was 81, 80 and 79\% respectively. The
   volumetric and specific naringinase activity of each strain was
   influenced by temperature, pH and water activity (Aw). The culture
   conditions optimal for A. foetidus, A. niger and A. niger HPD2 were as
   follows: pH 5.4, 35 degrees C, 0.5222 Aw; pH 5.4, 35 degrees C, 0.7533
   Aw; pH 5.4, 40 degrees C, 0.7533 Aw; respectively. The highest
   volumetric activity was obtained using A. foetidus with 2.58 U ml(-1),
   when grew on grapefruit rind. Among the strains used, optimal
   naringinase production was with A. foetidus. The use of grapefruit rind
   as a substrate gave a higher yield of naringinase production than using
   orange rind.},

Abstract = {Let X be a Hausdorff topological group and G a locally compact subgroup
   of X. We show that the natural action of G on X is proper in the sense
   of R. Palais. This is applied to prove that there exists a closed set F
   subset of X such that FG = X and the restriction of the quotient
   projection X -> X/G to F is a perfect map F -> X/G. This is a key result
   to prove that many topological properties (among them, paracompactness
   and normality) are transferred from X to X/G, and some others are
   transferred from X/G to X. Yet another application leads to the
   inequality dim X <= dim X/G+ dim G for every paracompact topological
   group X and a locally compact subgroup G of X having a compact group of
   connected components.},

Abstract = {Recent work has reported changes associated with physiological,
   morphological, and behavioural adaptation during the absorption of yolk
   reserves. The holobenthic endemic species Octopus maya was used to
   explore the energy supply needed from the food intake (I; J animal(-1)
   d(-1)) to supply the rate of production energy needed for body mass (P;
   J animal(-1) d(-1)) and respiration rate (R; J animal(-1) d(-1)) as a
   function of weight and age during the exponential early growth phase of
   the animal. Individually housed juveniles from hatching (1 d) to 105 d
   after hatching (DAH) were used, with the age and weight known, and the
   relationship between oxygen consumption (VO2; mg O2 animal(-1) d(-1))
   and weight (g) was established. Projections of I, R, and P as a function
   of age (Z) were made. The food intake destined to supply body mass
   production (\% P/ I) and respiration rate energy (\% R/ I) was analysed
   for an extended age range of 1-150 DAH. When O. maya juveniles hatched,
   they had a greater requirement for R than for P from the food intake,
   61\% (\% R/ I) and 13\% (\% P/ I), respectively, suggesting high
   metabolic cost associated with post-hatching (during yolk absorption).
   Within the period where ZR. ZP (1-105 DAH), there was sufficient
   metabolic energy to satisfy the demands for sustaining exponential body
   mass production. The age at which \% R/ I \% P/ I delimits the point
   where P cannot increase for reasons of metabolic constraint.},

Title = {GLMM-based modelling of growth in juvenile Octopus maya siblings:
   does growth depend on initial size?},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {67},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1509-1516},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In most studies on cephalopod growth, variability in initial size is
   masked by the assumption of a similar growth `` starting point{''} for
   all hatchlings and by calculating the growth rate (GR) through modelling
   the average size of individuals through time. Statistical
   interpretations based on such models are limited because regression
   assumptions (e. g. homoscedasticity and independence between subjects)
   are frequently violated. To avoid these limitations, generalized linear
   mixed modelling was used to model the early growth of two sets of
   siblings of the holobenthic octopus Octopus maya under controlled
   conditions. The aim was to (i) determine the effect of initial weight
   (IW) on the GR of individuals grouped in three size categories (small,
   medium, and large), (ii) obtain statistically reliable estimates of
   parameters in an exponential growth model for juveniles up to 105 d old,
   and (iii) evaluate the influence of hatching date on weight at hatching.
   Using restricted maximum likelihood, linear models were fitted between
   (i) IW and final weight (FW) for octopuses in each size category, and
   (ii) the natural logarithm of IW as a function of time. The models were
   validated by visually inspecting the residuals. Individual FW depended
   on IW, but GR did not differ between juveniles of different sizes. The
   exponential growth model for individuals of all size categories was,
   with 1i N(0, s2 {[} agei] 2d). Hatching date had no effect on hatching
   size (F 1.93; p 0.11). The GR value is similar to those reported for
   other holobenthic species, and one of the first estimates of the
   magnitude (d 0.20) and structure of the increase in variance of
   individual weight through time is provided.},

Title = {A unique Fock quantization for fields in non-stationary spacetimes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS},
Year = {2010},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In curved spacetimes, the lack of criteria for the construction of a
   unique quantization is a fundamental problem undermining the
   significance of the predictions of quantum field theory. Inequivalent
   quantizations lead to different physics. Recently, however, some
   uniqueness results have been obtained for fields in non-stationary
   settings. In particular, for vacua that are invariant under the
   background symmetries, a unitary implementation of the classical
   evolution suffices to pick up a unique Fock quantization in the case of
   Klein-Gordon fields with time-dependent mass, propagating in a static
   spacetime whose spatial sections are three-spheres. In fact, the field
   equation can be reinterpreted as describing the propagation in a
   Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime after a suitable scaling of the
   field by a function of time. For this class of fields, we prove here an
   even stronger result about the Fock quantization: the uniqueness
   persists when one allows for linear time-dependent transformations of
   the field in order to account for a scaling by background functions. In
   total, paying attention to the dynamics, there exists a preferred choice
   of quantum field, and only one SO(4)-invariant Fock representation for
   it that respects the standard probabilistic interpretation along the
   evolution. The result has relevant implications e. g. in cosmology.},

Abstract = {The study of liquid metallic alloys using first principles Molecular
   Dynamic (MD) requires the knowledge of the liquid phase density that is

   densities for the liquid phase of eutectic Aluminium Silicon alloy in
   the range of temperature from 856 K to 1270 K (The melting point for
   this alloy is 850 K). We build an atomic model in a periodic cubic cell
   with 125 atoms, 110 aluminium atoms and 15 silicon atoms. We then heat
   it from room temperature to the temperature of calculation T-max, above
   the melting temperature, in 100 computational steps and we maintain the
   cell at this temperature (plateau) during 100 computational steps.
   Finally we apply a volume optimization of the structure to find the
   desired density. This process is carried out several times until a
   minimum energy structure is reached. The results are compared with the
   experimental values. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Lipid composition of the mantle and digestive gland of Octopus vulgaris
   that were not fed for 27 days were determined. Every 3 days, three
   octopuses were killed and samples of the mantle and the digestive gland
   (DG) were taken, in order to determine total lipids as well as lipid
   classes and fatty acids. Composition in total lipids (TL) for the mantle
   was similar until day 21, then decreased and remained similar until the
   end of the experiment. Composition in total lipids for the DG decreased
   significantly after 3 days, then remained similar until day 21, and then
   decreased until the end of the experiment. As for the lipid classes, in
   the DG the main components were triglycerides and sterol esters. Sterol
   esters suffered strong reductions after 10 days of starvation, while
   triglycerides remained similar until day 21 and then decreased until the
   end of the experiment. Cholesterol decreased gradually throughout the
   experimental period. For polar lipids, phosphatidylcholine and
   phosphatidylethanolamine increased during the first 3 days and then
   decreased throughout the experiment. In the mantle, the only neutral
   classes that decrease were triacylglycerols and sterol esters, while no
   polar lipid classes decreased in this organ. It was noticeable the
   decrease in almost all fatty acids in the DG after 3 days of starvation,
   while in the mantle there were no differences in fatty acid
   concentrations during the experiment.},

Abstract = {The lipid profile and uric acid were evaluated in pregnant women who
   suffer high blood pressure in the first three-month period of pregnancy,
   treated sequentially in the Obstetric Service of Madariaga Hospital form
   February to June, 2009. Thirty-one hypertense pregnant women and
   fifty-eight pregnant women with normal blood pressure were studied. Both
   groups were between 20 and 35 years old and their body mass index was
   between 18.5-29.9 kg/m(2) before pregnancy. Personal,
   gynecological-obstetric and family data were recorded. Venous blood was
   extrated after 12 hours of fasting for biochemical determinations, which
   were analyzed through enzymatic colorimetric methods with internal and
   external quality controls. Hypertensive pregnant women versus pregnant
   women with normal blood pressure presented triglycerides (261 +/- 238 vs
   196.8 +/- 90.6, p=0.01), VLDL-Chol (49.07 +/- 23.75 vs 39.52 +/- 16.19,
   p=0.04), triglycerides/HDL-Chol (5.45 +/- 4.1 vs 3.57 +/- 1.77,
   p=0.031), uric acid (40.57 +/- 10.49 vs 55.64 +/- 20.26, p<0.001) no
   important differences were found for total cholesterol, HDL-Chol,
   no-HDL-Chol, LDL-Chol and Chol/HDL-Chol. The systolic blood pressure
   correlated in a significant way with most of the lipid parameters and
   uric acid. On multivariate analysis, uric acid, VLDL-chol and FAHTA
   account for 40\% of the variation in systolic blood pressure. The
   inclusion of the lipid profile and uric acid in hypertensive pregnant
   women's biochemical evaluation is suggested because they are accessible
   in low complexity laboratories and they would contribute to the
   evaluation of endothelium damage caused by transient high blood
   pressure.},

Title = {Phylogeny of the genus Palmanura (Collembola: Neanuridae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {482-496},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In order to assess the phylogenetic structure of the springtail genus
   Palmanura, as well as to test the monophyly of the tribe Sensillanurini
   (Neanuridae: Neanurinae), a data matrix of morphological (chaetotactic
   and other) characters of members of this group was assembled and
   analysed in the light of Wagner parsimony. The data matrix included all
   the known members of the Neotropical genus Palmanura, plus
   representatives of Sensillanura and Americanura. Although not all the
   clades obtained were highly supported by bootstrap resampling, some
   structures were relatively constant under different approaches.
   Alternative analyses (unordered and ordered character states, rescaled
   weighting procedure) were applied. While alternative solutions were
   obtained, a number of structures were shared by the results irrespective
   of the method used. On this basis, the results suggest that some further
   reassessment is required to confirm formally the monophyly of the tribe
   Sensillanurini. The genera Palmanura and Americanura are mutually
   poly/paraphyletic; we thus suggest that Palmanura should be considered
   as a synonym of Americanura, although some character reassessment and
   more varied outgroup species may be necessary before a formal generic
   redefinition can be proposed. Finally, a comparison of the performance
   of the characters under Wagner parsimony analysis indicated that
   differences in the characters' retention indexes are due not to the
   topological (tagmal) position of the traits involved, but to character
   coding: the characters describing quantitative features (generally
   numbers of setae) generally performed worse than other types of
   characters under parsimony. An updated list of the known members of the
   Sensillanurini (Collembola: Neanuridae: Neanurinae) is presented.(C) The
   Willi Hennig Society 2009.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the morphology of the sexual phase and spores of
   Platycerium andinum and Platycerium wandae. Spores were sown in
   Thompson's media and the cultures were kept at 24-25 degrees C, with 12
   h light/darkness photoperiod. Developmental phases were fixed in FAA and
   processed for observation with the scanning electron microscope. Spores
   of both species are monolete: Vittaria-type germination and
   Aspidium-type prothallial development were observed. In the phase of
   development, the gametophytes develop unicellular secretory and as they
   mature, develop bifurcated or branched pluricellular trichomes, both in
   the cushion and near the meristematic zone. Adult gametophytes in
   culture are cordiform-spatulate to cordiform-reniform, most are
   unisexual and a few are bisexual. Gametangia belong to the le
   ptosporangiate fern type. Archegonial morphology is uniform, with an
   elongate, thin neck curved toward the base of the gametophyte.
   Antheridia have a basal cell, an annular cell and an undivided opercular
   cell. Three hundred days after the spores were sown, sporophytes still
   had not developed. In both species, some spores germinate inside the
   sporangial capsule (intra-sporangial germination). We provide new
   information on morphogenesis in the genus Platycerium. (c) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {P>Almost no studies have been done with respect to major

   analysed MHC Class II DRB polymorphism and sequence diversity in two

   Myotis velifer and the narrowly distributed (and endangered) island
   endemic Myotis vivesi. We find extensive DRB polymorphism in the
   widespread M. velifer, similar to that commonly reported in other
   mammals. The geographically restricted M. vivesi by contrast shows only
   very limited polymorphism. We conclude that M. vivesi has undergone a
   dramatic loss of MHC polymorphism. The significance of this inference in
   light of other information on population structure and genetic diversity

Abstract = {Aging is a natural process characterized by a progressive functional
   impairment and reduced capacity to respond adaptively to environmental
   stimuli. Aging is associated with increased susceptibility to a variety
   of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and
   neurological diseases. Lung pathologies are not the exception, and the
   prevalence of several interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), primarily
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, has been found to increase considerably
   with age. Although our understanding of the biology of aging has
   advanced remarkably in the last 2 decades, the molecular mechanisms
   linking aging to ILD remain unclear. Immunosenescence, oxidative stress,
   abnormal shortening of telomeres, apoptosis, and epigenetic changes
   affecting gene expression have been proposed to contribute to the aging
   process, and aging-associated diseases. Here, we review the emerging
   concepts highlighting the putative aging-associated abnormalities
   involved in some human ILDs.},

Abstract = {A new species of Scincella, previously confused with S. laterals, Is
   described from the Cuatro Cienegas Basin, Coahuila, Mexico. The new
   species differs from all congeners in North and Middle America by
   possessing two dark, narrow ventrolateral stripes on each side (vs.
   dark, narrow ventrolateral stripes on each side absent in the other
   species); from all congeners in North and Middle America, except S.
   laterals, by having three or more pairs of nuchal scales (vs. fewer than
   three pairs of nuchals in the other species) and the first nuchal in
   contact with the tertiary temporal row (vs. first nuchal usually in
   contact with the upper secondary temporal in the other species); and
   from S. laterals by having longer limbs (limbs overlapping by 1-15
   scales when adpressed against body, hindlimb length/SVL ratio 0.30-0.42,
   (x) over bar = 0.36; vs. limbs separated by 2-23 scales when adpressed
   against body, hindlimb length/SVL ratio 0.24-0.37, (x) over bar = 0.30,
   in S. laterals) and usually more scales around midbody (28-30, (x) over
   bar = 29.0, n = 15; vs. 24-29, (x) over bar = 26.4, n = 28, in S.
   laterals). The new species is geographically closest, and
   morphologically most similar, to S. lateralis.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes landscape in a rainforest region integrating
   geomorphologic and ecosystem analysis methods. Major landscape elements
   (geology, geomorphology, soils, vegetation and land use) were mapped as
   biogeomorphic land units using remote sensing and geographic information
   systems (GIS). Associations between these variables were analyzed by map
   fusion and the results were expressed on a land unit map (scale ca.
   1:100,000). Volcanic structures are dominant in the study area. Lava
   flows cover most of the region, mainly as basalt; several pyroclastic
   cones are widely distributed over the area but are dominant in the
   southeast region. A hypsometric map derived from a digital elevation
   model (DEM), and intersected with a land cover/use map showed an
   altitudinal gradient of vegetation. Rainforest grows at lower altitudes
   (0 to 700 m) and Virola, Juglans and Chionantus are distributed from 700
   to 900 m. These species are located on slopes of basalt and andesites
   intercalated with tephra, recent isolated stratovolcano structures and
   an erosive flood plain. At higher altitudes (900 to 1100 m) the forest
   identified as Chionantus Ulmus Randia is associated with cinder cones. A
   Quercus Litmus forest (900 to 1400 m) covers the slopes of the highest
   volcano (San Martin) and surrounding areas, while evergreen (elfin)
   forest is at the top of this mountain (1660 m). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Current distribution and predicted geographic expansion of the
   Rufous-backed Robin in Mexico: a fading endemism?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},

Abstract = {Aim
   The Rufous-backed Robin Turdus rufopalliatus is a bird endemic to the
   Pacific slope of Mexico. The species recently established populations in
   several localities in the Mexican Central Highlands. Based on available
   data, we modelled the range expansion of the Rufous-backed Robin in
   Mexico to understand the pattern, mechanisms and ecological and
   biogeographic implications of its expansion.
   Location
   Mexico.
   Methods
   We assessed the species' presence and habitat requirements at two
   spatial scales. At the site level, we evaluated the relationship between
   land use and species presence in an urban environment. At the country
   level, we generated a niche model. We then produced a dispersion model
   through the interpolation of points generated from information derived
   from the niche model, the location of records within and outside its
   native distribution range, the species' natural history, habitat
   requirements and its estimated dispersion rate (4.2 km year-1).
   Results
   The dispersion model predicted that the species will significantly
   increase its distribution range in Mexico in the coming decades. Its
   expansion would occur by a stepping-stone colonization of suitable
   habitat in areas of native vegetation and human settlements. The model
   predicted that the species should arrive on the Gulf slope of Mexico
   before 2025.
   Main conclusions
   Mechanisms that could explain the species' success in establishing
   viable populations outside its native distribution include its
   dispersion ability, competitive release, the urban heat island
   phenomenon and the trade of wild birds. The geographic range expansion
   of the Rufous-backed Robin will probably create new interactions with
   other species, particularly with close taxonomic and ecological
   relatives. The increase in the distribution range of the Rufous-backed
   Robin has resulted from direct and indirect human-induced dispersion;
   therefore, it cannot be considered a fading endemism. In part of its
   expanded range (to date the Mexican Central Highlands), it should be
   considered an invasive alien species.},

Volume = {83},

Abstract = {Taxus globose is a gymnosperm inhabiting Mexican and northern Central
   American temperate forests, and it has been considered as threatened by
   Mexican and international conservancy agencies. In Mexico, habitat loss
   is one of the main threats for most of the cloud forest species
   including this taxon, being human-induced land use change a key issue.
   We obtained the potential distribution of this species through Maxent
   algorithm based on 73 herbarium records. Also the modification of
   vegetation cover for three time periods (1976, 1996 y 2000) was analyzed
   upon the potential distribution of this species. The known and potential
   geographical distribution was evaluated in relation to the current
   Mexican National System of Natural Protected Areas at federal level
   (ANPs) and Mexican Priority Regions for Conservation (RTPs), in order to
   determine the role of these areas in its conservation and management.
   Potential distribution models show an important reduction (until 84 \%)
   of the distribution area related with land use change. This species is
   scarcely represented in the ANPs, because less than 10 \% of its
   potential distribution occurs within these areas of federal protection.
   This approach represents an important tool in biogeography and
   conservation, as well as in other areas of biology, due to its
   predictive ability. Our results highlight the urgency to preserve the
   remaining Mexican temperate forest patches, mainly cloud forest ones, to
   guarantee the existence of this species.},

Title = {Shear and flexoelectric deformation effects on the dynamic structure

Abstract = {We use a fluctuating hydrodynamic description to calculate the
   orientation (director) correlation function of hydrodynamic fluctuations
   for a nematic liquid crystal in a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS).
   This state is produced by both, a planar shear flow and an external
   uniform electric field, which induces an elastic deformation through the
   so-called flexoelectric effect. We analyze the effects of these external
   gradients to estimate the changes on the light scattering spectrum
   produced by both gradients with respect to its equilibrium shape. We
   find that these non-equilibrium effects induce long-range effects on the
   orientation correlation with a k-dependence k(-2) and k(-3),
   respectively, giving rise to an asymmetry of the spectrum. This consists
   of an increment of its maximum and a displacement in the frequency shift
   space. These changes are proportional to the magnitude of the external
   gradients and also depend on the relative orientation of the gradients
   with respect to the wave vector. We find that for MBBA, the shear flow
   can produce significant increases on the dynamic structure factor of
   9.6\%, for normalized velocity gradients of the order 0.1-0.5. The
   flexoelectric effect produces only small changes on the structure
   factor, which are about two orders of magnitude smaller with respect to
   those due to the presence of the shear flow. Our analysis suggests that
   the effects produced on dynamic correlations by the flexoelectric effect
   would be hard to observe experimentally, while those due to the shear
   flow might be detectable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A rudist fauna composed of the radiolitids Potosites tristantorresi new
   genus, new species and Radio lites acutocostata (Adkins), the
   hippuritids Barrettia cf. ruseae Chubb, Torreites sanchezi (Douville),
   and Vaccinites vermunti Mac Gillavry, plagioptychids, and
   antillocaprinids is described from a rudist limestone succession in the
   central Mexican State of San Luis Potosi. The previously known species,
   one radiolitid from Texas and three hippuritids from the Caribbean
   Biogeographic Province, indicate the early Campanian. The new genus is a
   large radiolitid with a coiled and canaliculated left valve. New
   observations on R. acutocostata and V. vermunti shell morphology and
   variability are provided. Observations made on well preserved specimens
   of the latter species clarify the outer shell layer structure of the
   hippuritids right valve and has taxonomic implications. This is the
   first report of genus Torreites in Mexico and one of the northernmost
   records of genus Barrettia, already reported in southern Mexico from
   Chiapas State. This rudist limestone succession (informally `Temazcal
   limestones' herein) is an easy-to-recognize cartographical unit; up to
   now it and Santonian and Turonian units have been mapped as the El Abra
   Formation in most available geological maps. Recognition of the
   successive carbonate platform intervals, between El Abra and Cardenas
   formations, improves the geological mapping and the understanding of the
   Mexican Gulf western margin evolution during the Late Cretaceous.},

Abstract = {A new species of suctorian in the genus Periacineta, epibiotic on

   Periacineta mexicana n. sp. is a loricate suctorian with elongate body
   and rounded apical region; tentacles are distributed randomly over
   apical region and not grouped into fascicles. Macronucleus in adult is
   elongate and located centrally. The suctorian usually forms closely
   aggregated pseudocolonies. We provide morphological data based on
   optical and scanning electron microscopy. A comparison with similar
   congeners, and emended diagnosis of the genus Periacineta also are
   provided. The ciliates were found attached to the first two pairs of
   legs of Mexican notonectids Buenoa pallens and Buenoa spp.

   extreme eastern part of the municipality of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and
   are nearest to records for the species in the United States for Brazos
   Island-South Padre Island, Cameron County, Texas. In both regions, A.
   sexlineata occurs a short distance from the seashore in habitats formed
   and influenced by perturbations of hurricanes and the maritime climate
   of the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., sand dunes devoid of congeners with
   openings in halophytic vegetation). Samples of A. sexlineata from
   Tamaulipas are statistically similar to those from South Padre Island in
   two meristic characters, one ratio, and snout-vent length, but
   significantly different in one meristic character and one ratio
   involving color pattern. Because similarities among specimens from the
   plains of southern Texas, South Padre Island, and Tamaulipas are
   strongly indicated, it is reasonable to allocate the three groups to A.
   sexlineata stephensae. Texas yellow-headed racerunner.},

Title = {First report on the occurrence of microcystins in planktonic
   cyanobacteria from Central Mexico},

Abstract = {Although toxic cyanobacteria are commonly described worldwide, only one
   recent paper on the toxicity of cyanobacteria in Mexico has been
   published reporting the occurrence of cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxins.
   Microcystins are the most commonly studied cyanotoxins in many countries
   and those that may cause the most dramatic problems in terms of human
   health. In this paper, we studied the occurrence of potentially toxic
   cyanobacteria in different ecosystems in Central Mexico. Samples were
   collected in natural lakes (Zumpango, Laguna Atotonilco and Cienega
   Chica), reservoirs (Los Angeles and Valle de Bravo), man-made channels
   (Cuemanco, Tlameleca) and urban lakes (Chapultepec). A multi-technique
   approach was applied by the use of molecular, immunological and chemical
   techniques. Cyanobacteria were found in all the sites, ranging from 1.6
   x 10(3) cells/mL in Tlameleca to 7.5 x 10(6) cells/mL in Chapultepec
   Grande, representing between 67 and 100\% of the total phytoplankton
   density. The concentration of total microcystins varied between 4.9 and
   78.0 mu g MC-LR eq/L. The results revealed the occurrence of MC-LR in
   all the sites analyzed by MALDI-TOF, and MC-FR, MC-RR and MC-H4YR in two
   sites. Most of the studied sites are used either as a source of drinking
   water, as a recreational area, or for agriculture irrigation purposes,
   so the risk for human health may be high if not properly monitored. This
   is the first report on the MC profiles and concentrations in blooms
   collected in Mexico. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A series of Te-substituted pyrochlores of stoichiometry
   Gd-2(Ti2-yTey)O-7 (y <= 0.2) were prepared under high-pressure and
   high-temperature conditions and characterized by X-ray diffraction,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies revealed that
   the Te4+ and Te6+ ions occupy the Ti4+ sites; the percentage of the
   contribution of Te6+ increases as tellurium content. These substitutions
   induce an increase of the volume of the TiO6 octahedron due to the
   increase in the Ti-O(2) bond length, which preserves the oxygen
   positional parameter (x(48f)) and the Gd-O(1) bond length. Results of
   Raman spectroscopy showed a significant shift to higher frequencies of
   the E-g mode associated to the O(2) sublattice, as well an increase in
   the full-width-at-half-maximum intensity (FWHM) of the F-2g mode (O-Gd-O
   bending) as the level of Te substitution for Ti increases. These results
   are discussed and compared with those reported in the literature. (C)

Title = {The effects of microencapsulated bovine insulin given to Litopenaeus
   vannamei juveniles as a feed additive on growth, metabolism, and

Abstract = {In recent years, insulin-like peptides have been identified, cloned, and
   their effects studied in several invertebrate species, such as fruit
   flies, bees, worms, and mollusks. Although insulin-like activities have
   been identified in lobster and crab species, there is little information
   about the roles of these peptides on other crustaceans. In this work, we
   examined the effects of microencapsulated bovine insulin used as a feed
   additive on several biochemical parameters of cultured Litopenaeus
   vannamei. We measured the variation in muscle and hepatopancreas
   glycogen, several hemolymph metabolites, and trypsin- and
   chymotrypsin-like activities in response to two doses of
   microencapsulated bovine insulin with respect to control individuals. We
   found that microencapsulated bovine insulin did not significantly
   stimulate weight gain in treated animals at the assayed doses. Insulin
   altered the use of hemolymph glucose, total proteins and hemocyanin
   during molt stages. Also, soluble digestive gland protein, trypsin-like
   activity, as well as hepatopancreatic and muscular glycogen were
   affected in relation to molt. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that
   at the assayed doses insulin administered to shrimp as a feed additive
   affects mainly the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, rather that
   acting as a growth hormone. In this sense, we provide evidence that a
   diet with 25 mg insulin per kg diet enhanced protein synthesis and
   hemocyanin improving possibly the shrimp immune condition. (C) 2010

Abstract = {We investigate the evolutionary history of the wide-ranging Nearctic
   treefrog Hyla arenicolor through the integration of extensive range-wide
   sampling, phylogenetic analyses of multilocus genetic data, and
   divergence dating. Previous phylogeographic studies of this frog
   documented a potential signature of introgressive hybridization from an
   ecologically and morphologically divergent sister species. Based on our
   Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA, we inferred strong
   phylogeographic structure in H. arenicolor as indicated by seven
   well-supported clades, five of which correspond to well-defined
   biogeographic regions. Clades from the Balsas Basin and southwestern
   Central Mexican Plateau in Mexico, and the Grand Canyon of Arizona,
   group with the morphologically, behaviorally, and ecologically divergent
   mountain treefrogs in the H. eximia group, rendering H. arenicolor as
   paraphyletic. The phylogenetic position of at least two of these three
   H. arenicolor clades within the H. eximia group, however, is most likely
   the result of several episodes of introgressive hybridization and
   subsequent mitochondrial gene capture separated in time and space, as
   supported by evidence from the nuclear genes. Hyla arenicolor from the
   Balsas Basin appear to be deeply divergent from other H. arenicolor and
   represent a distinctly different species. Results suggests that
   introgressive hybridization events, both ancient and contemporary,
   coupled with late Neogene vicariance and Pleistocene climate-driven
   range shifts, have all played a role in the historical diversification
   of H. arenicolor.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the Collembola communities at 3 different heights on
   epiphytic moss. The study was carried out in an Abies religiosa forest,
   in the locality of San Rafael in the State of Mexico, Mexico. Collembola
   inhabiting epiphytic moss were sampled during November 2003, and during
   March, June and August 2004. The Shannon's diversity index, species
   richness, as well as their density and diversity were estimated in 3
   communities. The total number of Collembola species that was collected
   was 12, with the species richness and density decreasing as the height
   of tree increased. The height on trees where moss was sampled had a
   significant negative effect on species diversity as well as on the
   densities of Pseudachorutes subcrassus, Entomobrya ca. triangularis,
   Americabrya arida and Ptenothrix marmorata. Our results suggest that
   vertical stratification of Collembola is affected by, differentiation of
   the microhabitats at different height levels of trees and by
   morphological and ecological features of species. This also demonstrates
   the capacity of Collembola for migration to other tree heights in order
   to search for food and to avoid predation.},

Abstract = {In order to know the species of Papilionoidea in the area and to
   describe its temporary distribution, the specimens were monthly captured
   from August of 1983 to December of 1986. 145 species of 4 families of
   Papilionoidea were recognized, and added to the obtained registries of
   literature with a total of 148 species for Canon de Lobos; 21 of them
   are endemic to Mexico. Nymphalidae and Lycaenidae were the richest
   families, while Nymphalidae was the most abundant. Like in other
   tropical areas, the temporary distribution of the Papilionoidea is
   associated closely with the precipitation, reason why there were more
   species and specimens during the rainy season. The most of
   rhopalocerofauna of Canon de Lobos is conformed by scarse and rare
   species that are resident in the area; only 10\% of the species is
   associated exclusively to the dry forest. In comparison with other
   localities of Morelos, Canon de Lobos has one of the greater richness.},

Abstract = {The knowledge about ants of arid zones of Mexico is very poor. For this
   reason we assessed the biodiversity of this taxon in 2 sites with
   different vegetation structure. Ten pitfall traps were placed in each
   site, and 2 surveys were conducted, 1 in August (rainy season, 2004) and
   another in February (dry season, 2005). The capture was more abundant in
   the rainy season; however, during the study, a higher ant diversity was
   observed in the site with low vegetation cover and few plant diversity.
   Compared with other arid zones of Mexico, the Zapotitlan de las Salinas
   Valley is the site with the highest ant species richness. The new
   records have increased richness to 27 ant species, which is very close
   to the number of species registered in other localities near Zapotitlan.
   Our data suggest that increasing sampling effort and application of
   different sampling techniques, the ant richness species could be
   increased.},

Abstract = {The increasing urbanization in big cities, that jeopardizes the
   ecosystems, makes it important to protect them as well as to recognize
   and manage the services they provide. In order to have the required
   scientific evidence to support conservation projects, an assessment of
   water quality and quantity seen as hydrological ecosystem services in
   the Magdalena River watershed, was carried out. Water quality was
   assessed in two annual cycles based on physicochemical, chemical,
   bacteriological and algal indicators, showing an abrupt change between
   the natural and urbanized areas. This has the potential to affect
   negatively the recreational activities practised in the area. The
   relevance of the indicators for water quality is that they show
   different aspects of the problem: physical and chemical parameters
   indicate variations across sites along the Magdalena River and point the
   places where domestic discharges occur. Algae reveal the natural
   conditions of the habitat and the risks to public health can be assessed
   with bacteriological indicators. To calculate the water quantity,
   balances were made in order to know the amount of water that runoff in
   the three dominant plant communities: the fir forest that generates
   10,944,800 m(3) of water per year, the pine forest generates 6,878,000
   m(3) and the mixed and oak forest generates 3,217,500 m(3). It is
   important to preserve the hydrological ecosystem services conserving the
   forests and rehabilitating the Magdalena River in order to enhance the
   provision of drinking water to the southern part of Mexico City.},

Title = {Ecological-Niche Modeling and Prioritization of Conservation-Area

Abstract = {One of the most important tools in conservation biology is information
   on the geographic distribution of species and the variables determining
   those patterns. We used maximum-entropy niche modeling to run
   distribution models for 222 amphibian and 371 reptile species (49\%
   endemics and 27\% threatened) for which we had 34,619 single geographic
   records. The planning region is in southeastern Mexico, is 20\% of the
   country's area, includes 80\% of the country's herpetofauna, and lacks
   an adequate protected-area system. We used probabilistic data to build
   distribution models of herpetofauna for use in prioritizing conservation
   areas for three target groups (all species and threatened and endemic
   species). The accuracy of species-distribution models was better for
   endemic and threatened species than it was for all species. Forty-seven
   percent of the region has been deforested and additional conservation
   areas with 13.7\% to 88.6\% more native vegetation (76\% to 96\% of the
   areas are outside the current protected-area system) are needed. There
   was overlap in 26 of the main selected areas in the conservation-area
   network prioritized to preserve the target groups, and for all three
   target groups the proportion of vegetation types needed for their
   conservation was constant: 30\% pine and oak forests, 22\% tropical
   evergreen forest, 17\% low deciduous forest, and 8\% montane cloud
   forests. The fact that different groups of species require the same
   proportion of habitat types suggests that the pine and oak forests
   support the highest proportion of endemic and threatened species and
   should therefore be given priority over other types of vegetation for
   inclusion in the protected areas of southeastern Mexico.},

   doi:10.1152/ajplung.00070.2010.-Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a
   progressive and lethal lung disease characterized by the expansion of
   the fibroblast/myofibroblast population and aberrant remodeling.
   However, the origin of mesenchymal cells in this disorder is still under
   debate. Recent evidence indicates that epithelial-mesenchymal transition
   (EMT) induced primarily by TGF-beta 1 plays an important role; however,
   studies regarding the opposite process, mesenchymal-epithelial
   transition, are scanty. We have previously shown that fibroblast growth
   factor-1 (FGF-1) inhibits several profibrogenic effects of TGF-beta 1.
   In this study, we examined the effects of FGF-1 on TGF-beta 1-induced
   EMT. A549 and RLE-6TN (human and rat) alveolar epithelial-like cell
   lines were stimulated with TGF-beta 1 for 72 h, and then, in the
   presence of TGF-beta 1, were cultured with FGF-1 plus heparin for an
   additional 48 h. After TGF-beta 1 treatment, epithelial cells acquired a
   spindle-like mesenchymal phenotype with a substantial reduction of
   E-cadherin and cytokeratins and concurrent induction of alpha-smooth
   muscle actin measured by real-time PCR, Western blotting, and
   immunocytochemistry. FGF-1 plus heparin reversed these morphological
   changes and returned the epithelial and mesenchymal markers to control
   levels. Signaling pathways analyzed by selective pharmacological
   inhibitors showed that TGF-beta 1 induces EMT through Smad pathway,
   while reversion by FGF-1 occurs through MAPK/ERK kinase pathway,
   resulting in ERK-1 phosphorylation and Smad2 dephosphorylation. These
   findings indicate that TGF-beta 1-induced EMT is reversed by FGF-1 and
   suggest therapeutic approaches to target this process in IPF.},

Abstract = {First principles electronic structure investigations of the oxygen
   diffusion into neutral, cationic, and dicationic oxygen vacancies on
   MgO(100) surfaces have been carried out within a density functional
   theory cluster-embedding approach. The transition states and activation
   barriers for the oxygen diffusion were determined. It was found that the
   charge of the vacancy has a marked effect on the oxygen diffusion as the
   activation barrier decreases from 2.84 eV in the neutral, to 2.18 eV in
   the cationic, and to 0.94 eV in the dicationic oxygen vacancies. An
   analysis of the relaxation of the surface atoms around the vacancies,
   and the geometry of the transition states, leads us to conclude that the
   attractive interaction between the localized positive charge and the
   electron-rich oxygen atoms, and the relaxation of surface atoms, are
   responsible for lowering the activation barrier. In addition, our
   studies on layer relaxations indicate that the oxygen diffusion is
   strongly confined to the surface atoms. The analysis of the spin density
   along the reaction path of the oxygen diffusion into a cationic vacancy
   suggests that the oxygen movement is accompanied by an electron hopping
   process.},

Title = {Helminths of the American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus

Abstract = {The American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus, is one of the most
   intensively studied host species. However, most of the records related
   to the parasites of this anuran are scattered through the literature.
   The purpose of our study is twofold: 1) to list the helmiths of this
   host from Pawnee Lake, Lancaster Co., Nebraska, USA, and 2) To compile
   all published records and those contained by several scientific
   collections to construct a checklist of helminth parasites associated
   with the American bullfrog through its range in both native and
   introduced geographical areas. Twenty-seven specimens of L. catesbeianus
   were collected and examined for helminth parasites; 20 frogs were
   infected. Nine species of helminths were collected: 4 digeneans:
   Haematoloechus coloradensis, H. parviplexus, Gorgoderina attenuata, and
   Glypthelmins quieta, and 5 nematodes: Rhabdias ranae, Spinitectus
   gracilis, Cosmocercoides variabilis, Spiroxys sp., and an unidentified
   ascarid nematode. Pawnee Lake represents a new locality record for S.
   gracilis. The digenean H. parviplexus had the highest prevalence and
   mean abundance (33.3\% and 3, respectively). As a result of our study,
   the number of helminth taxa known for this host is 159 (75 digeneans, 4
   monogeneans, 10 cestodes, 7 acanthocephalans, and 63 nematodes); these
   records come from 6 countries (Canada, Cuba, Japan, Korea, United
   Kingdom, and USA). Although well documented, the helminthological record
   of this host species could increase after further inventory work in
   poorly sampled regions.},

Abstract = {Aim of the study: Cecropia obtusifolia and Cecropia peltata are plants
   highly used by the Mexican diabetic population to treat type 2 diabetes.
   Previous studies have assessed their hypoglycemic effect in animal
   models and in type 2 diabetic patients. Both plants contain cholorogenic
   acid, an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate translocase. In this work, we
   found a mechanism by which to understand how these plants could produce
   the observed hypoglycemic effect according to their traditional use. To
   test the hypothesis that targeting gluconeogenesis with an inhibitor of
   Gl-6-P translocase could result in a reduction of hepatic glucose
   production, we examined the effects of Cecropia obtusifolia and Cecropia
   peltata on gluconeogenesis (in vivo) and the activity of the enzyme (in
   vitro).
   Materials and methods: The extracts of the two plants were analyzed by
   HPLC to confirm their phytochemical composition. To test the inhibition
   of gluconeogenesis in vivo, a pyruvate tolerance test (2 g/kg) was
   performed in 18-h fasted n5-STZ rats. The effect of the extracts
   (Cecropia obtusifolia and Cecropia peltata 150 mg/kg) on
   glucose-6-phosphatase activity was assayed in vitro with intact rat
   liver microsomes.
   Results: Using HPLC-DAD, we confirmed that the main components of both
   species are chlorogenic acid and isoorientin. Diabetic rats treated with
   the extracts showed a lower glucose curve. The tested extracts were able
   to reduce the increase in the glucose blood level, and they inhibited
   the glucose-6-P activity with IC(50)s of 224 mu g/ml for Cecropia
   obtusifolia aqueous, 160 mu g/ml for Cecropia obtusifolia butanolic, 146
   mu g/ml for Cecropia peltata aqueous and 150 mu g/ml for Cecropia
   peltata butanolic.
   Conclusions: The results of the experiments presented here suggest that
   the administration of both plants can improve glycemic control by
   blocking the hepatic glucose output, especially in the fasting state.
   These data support the traditional use of the plants as ``agua de
   uso{''}, a cold infusion of the plant consumed over the course of a day.

Abstract = {Tropical forests will experience relatively large changes in temperature
   and rainfall towards the end of this century. Little is known about how
   tropical trees will respond to these changes. We used tree rings to
   establish climate-growth relations of a pioneer tree, Mimosa
   acantholoba, occurring in tropical dry secondary forests in southern
   Mexico. The role of large-scale climatic drivers in determining
   interannual growth variation was studied by correlating growth to sea
   surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
   including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Annual growth varied
   eightfold over 1970-2007, and was correlated with wet season rainfall
   (r=0.75). Temperature, cloud cover and solar variation did not affect
   growth, although these climate variables correlated with growth due to
   their relations with rainfall. Strong positive correlations between
   growth and SSTA occurred in the North tropical Atlantic during the first
   half of the year, and in the Pacific during the second half of the year.
   The Pacific influence corresponded closely to ENSO-like influences with
   negative effects of high SSTA in the eastern Pacific Nino3.4 region on
   growth due to decreases in rainfall. During El Nino years growth was
   reduced by 37\%. We estimated how growth would be affected by the
   predicted trend of decreasing rainfall in Central America towards the
   end of this century. Using rainfall predictions of two sets of climate
   models, we estimated that growth at the end of this century will be
   reduced by 12\% under a medium (A1B) and 21\% under a high (A2) emission
   scenario. These results suggest that climate change may have
   repercussions for the carbon sequestration capacity of tropical dry
   forests in the region.},

Abstract = {Red shrimp, Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis, larvae's response to different
   concentrations of live foods (diatoms Chaetoceros gracilis: 20-100 x 103
   cells/mL; flagellate Tetraselmis chuii: 2-10 x 103 cells/mL and Artemia
   nauplii {[}NA]: 1-5 NA/mL) was investigated in three experiments.
   Experimental assessments were based on four variables: survival rate,
   weight gain, development index (DI), and resistance to salinity stress.
   A combination of C. gracilis 80 x 103 cells/mL, T. chuii 2 x 103
   cells/mL, and Artemia 4 NA/mL provided the best experimental response.
   Specifically, F. brasiliensis larvae fed with the above-mentioned
   optimal concentrations of microalgae and Artemia grew faster and reached
   the postlarval stage in less time (168 h) than larvae in other feeding
   regimes evaluated. The effect of C. gracilis concentration on larval
   growth, survival, and the DI demonstrated that microalgae-based foods
   could be a highly productive alternative to more traditional aquaculture
   feeding regimes.},

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at evaluating the sequence of the
   histological and quantitative changes that occur in diverse components
   of the interstitial tissue, as well as the variations in the number and
   volume of Leydig cells of the testes of Gallus domesticus from 8-day-old
   embryo to 28-week-old chickens. Results indicate an increase in total
   volume of all components of the interstitial tissue: Leydig cells, blood
   vessels, and interstitium of chicken testes with advancing development.
   The proportion of each component differs markedly according to the age
   of the animal. Data indicate that Leydig cells are present in the
   chicken testes from pre-hatching to sexual maturity, and show an
   increase in the total volume, number per testis, and individual cell
   volume along the age of the animal. Values of P<0.05 were considered
   statistically significant. The results indicate that the total volume of
   Leydig cells is the dominant component of the interstitial tissue in the
   testes of 6-week-old chickens, but in testes of chicken embryos
   correspond to the lowest percentage of interstitial tissue. Results also
   reveal that hyperplasia is more important than cell hypertrophy in the
   increase of the total volume of Leydig cells during advancing
   development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {It is well known that many ranked linguistic data can fit well with
   one-parameter models such as Zipf's law for ranked word frequencies.
   However, in cases where discrepancies from the one-parameter model occur
   (these will come at the two extremes of the rank), it is natural to use
   one more parameter in the fitting model. In this paper, we compare
   several two-parameter models, including Beta function, Yule function,
   Weibull function-all can be framed as a multiple regression in the
   logarithmic scale-in their fitting performance of several ranked
   linguistic data, such as letter frequencies, word-spacings, and word
   frequencies. We observed that Beta function fits the ranked letter
   frequency the best, Yule function fits the ranked word-spacing
   distribution the best, and Altmann, Beta, Yule functions all slightly
   outperform the Zipf's power-law function in word ranked-frequency
   distribution.},

Abstract = {Several members of the most ancient living lineages of flowering plants
   (angiosperms) inhabit humid, woody, mostly tropical habitats. Here we
   assess whether one of these forest types, the cloud forests of Mexico
   (CFM), contain a relatively higher proportion of phylogenetically
   early-diverging angiosperm lineages. The CFM houses an extraordinary
   plant species diversity, including members of earliest-diverging
   angiosperm lineages. The phylogenetic composition of CFM angiosperm
   diversity was evaluated through the relative representation of orders
   and families with respect to the global flora, and the predominance of
   phylogenetically early- or late-diverging lineages. Goodness-of-fit
   tests indicated significant differences in the proportional local and
   global representation of angiosperm clades. The net difference between
   the percentage represented by each order and family in the CFM and the
   global flora allowed identification of clades that are overrepresented
   and underrepresented in the CFM. Early-diverging angiosperm orders and
   families were found to be neither over- nor underrepresented in the CFM.
   A slight predominance of late-diverging phylogenetic levels among
   overrepresented clades, however, was encountered in the CFM. The
   resulting pattern suggests that cloud forests provide habitats where the
   most ancient angiosperm lineages have survived in the face of
   accumulating species diversity belonging to phylogenetically
   late-diverging lineages.},

Abstract = {We study the electron propagator in quantum electrodynamics in one and
   two spatial dimensions in the presence of external electromagnetic
   fields. In this case, the propagator is not diagonal in momentum space.
   We obtain the propagator on the basis of the eigenfunctions of the
   operator (gamma center dot Pi)(2) in terms of which the propagator
   acquires a free form. Pi(mu) is the canonical momentum operator and
   gamma(mu) are the Dirac matrices. In two dimensions, we work with an
   irreducible representation of the Clifford algebra and consider to all
   orders the effects of an arbitrary magnetic field perpendicular to the
   plane of motion of the electrons. We then discuss the special cases of a
   uniform magnetic field and an exponentially damped static magnetic
   field. These cases are relevant to graphene in the massless limit. We
   further consider the electron propagator for the massive Schwinger model
   and incorporate the effects of a constant electric field to all orders.

Title = {Inhibition and Role of let-7d in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis},

Abstract = {Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic,
   progressive, and usually lethal fibrotic lung disease characterized by
   profound changes in epithelial cell phenotype and fibroblast
   proliferation. Objectives. To determine changes in expression and role
   of microRNAs in IPF.
   Methods. RNA from 10 control and 10 IPF tissues was hybridized on
   Agilent microRNA microarrays and results were confirmed by quantitative
   real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. SMAD3
   binding to the let-7d promoter was confirmed by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, luciferase
   assays, and reduced expression of let-7d in response to transforming
   growth factor-p. HMGA2, a let-7d target, was localized by
   immunohistochemistry. In mice, let-7d was inhibited by intratracheal
   administration of a let-7d antagomir and its effects were determined by
   immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction, and morphometry.
   Measurements and Main Results. Eighteen microRNAs including let-7d were
   significantly decreased in IPF. Transforming growth factor-beta
   down-regulated let-7d expression, and SMAD3 binding to the let-7d
   promoter was demonstrated. Inhibition of let-7d caused increases in
   mesenchymal markers N-cadherin-2, vimentin, and a-smooth muscle actin
   (ACTA2) as well as HMGA2 in multiple epithelial cell lines. let-7d was
   significantly reduced in IPF lungs and the number of epithelial cells
   expressing let-7d correlated with pulmonary functions. HMGA2 was
   increased in alveolar epithelial cells of IPF lungs. let-7d inhibition
   in vivo caused alveolar septal thickening and increases in collagen,
   ACTA2 and S100A4 expression in SFTPC (pulmonary-associated surfactant
   protein C) expressing alveolar epithelial cells.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate a role for microRNAs in IPF. The
   down-regulation of let-7d in IPF and the profibrotic effects of this
   down-regulation in vitro and in vivo suggest a key regulatory role for
   this microRNA in preventing lung fibrosis.},

Title = {Genetic and ecological differentiation in the endemic avifauna of
   Tiburon Island},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {398-406},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Tiburon Island is a land-bridge island in the Gulf of California,
   separated from mainland Sonora by 3 km. The shallow channel (13 m)
   separating the island and mainland is thought to have formed 10 000
   years ago. Although the majority of avian resident species are not
   taxonomically differentiated, six species are represented by endemic
   subspecies (cactus wren, gila woodpecker, black-tailed gnatcatcher,
   Gambel's quail, canyon towhee, northern cardinal), of which all but one
   (black-tailed gnatcatcher) possess a pallid, ash-gray coloration
   compared to those on the mainland. We compared mtDNA sequences of five
   of the endemic subspecies (we lacked samples of northern cardinal) and
   one more widespread subspecies (verdin) present on the island from
   sequences previously published for mainland populations. For most
   populations, we discovered no genetic differentiation between the island
   and the mainland, thus questioning the taxonomic validity of the endemic
   subspecies. The canyon towhee and the verdin showed significant
   mitochondrial DNA differentiation, although neither was reciprocally
   monophyletic. We modeled the ecological niche for the mainland
   populations of the study species (plus the curve-billed thrasher, which
   was studied earlier) and determined if species' occurrence on the island
   was predicted. We found no ecological differences for the four species
   that showed no genetic differences and one of the species that did
   (verdin). In contrast, some ecological differentiation was detected for
   the canyon towhee and the curve-billed thrasher. We conclude that the
   ecological differences leading to paler plumages in Tiburon Island
   endemics are sufficiently subtle as to not be discovered in our
   ecological models, although they are likely influenced by variation in
   rainfall, temperature and the vegetation. In addition, the black-tailed
   gnatcatcher is not paler, and therefore might respond to different
   ecological variables. We simulated sequence data and showed that if the
   populations on Tiburon Island have been isolated for 10 000 years, there
   ought to be greater differences than we observed for black-tailed
   gnatcatcher, Gambel's quail, cactus wren, and gila woodpecker,
   suggesting that there has been gene flow connecting the mainland and
   island populations. If so, then the paler coloration of these Tiburon
   Island subspecies (excluding black-tailed gnatcatcher) has been
   maintained by natural selection despite gene flow. In any case, the pale
   coloration apparently evolved within the past 10 000 years.},

Abstract = {Objective: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immunological
   disorder caused by antigen exposure in susceptible individuals. The
   PDCD1 polymorphisms, PD1.3 and PD1.5 have been associated with the
   susceptibility to inflammatory disorders. This study was conducted to
   test whether the PD1.3 and PD1.5 polymorphisms are associated with HP in
   Mexican patients and to explore the distribution of these polymorphisms
   in different Mexican ethnic groups.
   Design and methods: We studied 98 Mexican patients with HP and 92
   healthy Mexican controls. Also, 156 healthy Amerindian individuals from
   two ethnic groups were included (96 Mayans and 60 Mayos). Polymorphisms
   were determined by TagMan 5' nuclease assays.
   Results: Significant differences in the distribution of the PD1.3 and
   PD1.5 genotypes between HP patients and healthy Mestizo controls were
   not found. We observed a significantly different distribution of these
   polymorphisms in Mexican Mestizos when compared to the Amerindians.
   Conclusions: We found no association between PD1 polymorphism and HP:
   however the distribution of these polymorphisms was different in Mexican
   Mestizos and Amerindians. (c) 2010 The Canadian Society of Clinical

Title = {Bermuda as an Evolutionary Life Raft for an Ancient Lineage of
   Endangered Lizards},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Oceanic islands are well known for harboring diverse species assemblages
   and are frequently the basis of research on adaptive radiation and
   neoendemism. However, a commonly overlooked role of some islands is
   their function in preserving ancient lineages that have become extinct
   everywhere else (paleoendemism). The island archipelago of Bermuda is
   home to a single species of extant terrestrial vertebrate, the endemic
   skink Plestiodon (formerly Eumeces) longirostris. The presence of this
   species is surprising because Bermuda is an isolated, relatively young
   oceanic island approximately 1000 km from the eastern United States.
   Here, we apply Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using a relaxed molecular
   clock to demonstrate that the island of Bermuda, although no older than
   two million years, is home to the only extant representative of one of
   the earliest mainland North American Plestiodon lineages, which diverged
   from its closest living relatives 11.5 to 19.8 million years ago. This
   implies that, within a short geological time frame, mainland North
   American ancestors of P. longirostris colonized the recently emergent
   Bermuda and the entire lineage subsequently vanished from the mainland.
   Thus, our analyses reveal that Bermuda is an example of a ``life raft''
   preserving millions of years of unique evolutionary history, now at the
   brink of extinction. Threats such as habitat destruction, littering, and
   non-native species have severely reduced the population size of this
   highly endangered lizard.},

Title = {Cytotaxonomy and DNA taxonomy of lizards (Squamata, Sauria) from a
   tropical dry forest in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve on the
   coast of Jalisco, Mexico},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests contribute to a substantial proportion of the
   herpetological diversity of Mexico. The south-western coast of Jalisco
   is one of the more important areas by number of endemics and the high
   presence of endangered and restricted species. In this paper we used a
   combined karyological and molecular genetic (sequences of mtDNA genes
   for NDH2, cytb or 16S rDNA) approach to genetically characterize 13
   lizard species belonging to seven families that inhabit the dry forests
   of the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve (Anguidae: Gerrhonotus cf.
   liocephalus; Eublepharidae: Coleonyx elegans; Phyllodactylidae:
   Phyllodactylus lanei; Gekkonidae: Hemidactylus frenatus;
   Phrynosomatidae: Sceloporus melanorhinus, S. utiformis, Urosaurus
   bicarinatus; Polychrotidae: Norops nebulosus; Scincidae: Mabuya
   unimarginata, Plestiodon parvulus; Teiidae: Ameiva undulata,
   Aspidoscelis communis, A. lineattissima). The karyotypes of six species
   were here described for the first time (G. liocephalus, 2n = 38, 14
   macrochromosomes and 24 microcromosomes; C. elegans, 2n = 24 FN = 26; N.
   nebulosus 2n = 30, 13 macro- and 17 microchromosomes; M. unimarginata 2n
   = 32, 18 macro- and 14 microchromosomes; P. parvulus 2n = 26, 12 macro-
   and 14 microchromosomes; A. undulata 2n = 50, 26 macro- and 24
   microchromosomes). Chromosomal heteromorphism was found in C. elegans,
   N. nebulosus, and S. melanorhinus. For P. lanei we found a karyotype
   different from that previously described in other localities. This
   variation matched with a high genetic divergence usually found in
   different species. The DNA typing of mtDNA genes allowed the
   identification of the taxonomic affinities of five Mexican endemic
   species, namely: U. bicarinatus, A. nebulosus, P. parvulus, A.
   lineattissima and A. communis. The specimen of Gerrhonotus from Chamela
   is very divergent by 16S rDNA and probably does not belong to the so far
   studied species of Gerrhonotus. High genetic divergence has been also
   observed between samples of A. undulata and U. bicarinatus from
   different regions. In these latter two cases, additional data are needed
   to understand the taxonomic status of these populations.},

Abstract = {Hexane, chloroform and methanol extracts of different parts of Ipomoea
   pauciflora were tested for their effects on the survival and development
   of Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), a Lepidoptera pest. For seven
   days, neonatal larvae (grown at 27 +/- 2 degrees C with a 16: 8 (L: D) h
   photoperiod) were exposed to different concentrations of crude I.
   pauciflora extracts (ranging from 0 to 4 mg/ml) that were incorporated
   into an artificial diet. Surviving larvae were weighed at days 6, 9 and
   13 and were maintained until moths emerged. Eleven of the 18 crude
   extracts showed more than 30\% larval mortality. The highest mortality
   was produced by hexane and chloroform extracts of seeds at 4 mg/ml (96.9
   and 93.8\%, respectively), with LC50 values of 1.85 mg/ml and 0.54
   mg/ml, respectively. Fractions of both seed extracts were isolated by
   gravity column chromatography over silica gel and analyzed for their
   active compounds. Eight fractions of the hexane extract and six
   fractions of the chloroform extract from I. pauciflora seeds, exhibited
   larvicidal effects at 1 mg/ml (mortality from 33.3 to 88.9\% and from
   47.2 to 77\%, respectively). Changes in larval weight were observed as
   compared with the control group. Phytochemical analysis through GC-MS
   and H-1 NMR revealed the presence of fatty acids and aldehydes in the
   active fractions. These results indicate that the bioactive extracts
   from the seed of I. pauciflora can induce lethal toxicity in S.
   frugiperda larvae or affect the weight of the surviving larvae.},

Title = {Bioinformatic analysis of P granule-related proteins: insights into germ

Abstract = {Germ cells in many animals possess a specialized cytoplasm in the form
   of granules that contain RNA and protein complexes essential for the
   function and preservation of the germline. The mechanism for the
   formation of these granules is still poorly understood; however, the
   lack of conservation in their components across different species
   suggests evolutionary convergence in the assembly process. Germ granules
   are assumed to be present in all nematodes with a preformed germline.
   However, few studies have clearly identified these structures in species
   other than Caenorhabditis elegans and even less have carried functional
   analysis to provide a broader panorama of the granules composition in
   the phylum. We adopted a bioinformatics approach to investigate the
   extension of conservation in nematodes of some known C. elegans germ
   granule components, as a proxy to understand germ granules evolution in
   this phylum. Unexpectedly, we found that, in nematodes, the DEAD box RNA
   helicase Vasa, a conserved protein among different phyla, shows a
   complex history of clade-specific duplications and sequence divergence.
   Our analyses suggest that, in nematodes, Vasa's function might be shared
   among proteins like LAF-1, VBH-1, and GLH-1/-2/-3 and GLH-4. Key
   components of P granules assembly in C. elegans, like the PGL protein
   family, are only preserved in Caenorhabditis species. Our analysis
   suggests that germ granules assembly may not be conserved in nematodes.
   Studies on these species could bring insight into the basic components
   required for this pathway.},

Title = {Quantum Fluctuations and the Unruh effect in strongly-coupled conformal
   field theories},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2010},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study a uniformly accelerated
   quark in the vacuum of strongly-coupled conformal field theories in
   various dimensions, and determine the resulting stochastic fluctuations
   of the quark trajectory. From the perspective of an inertial observer,
   these are quantum fluctuations induced by the gluonic radiation emitted
   by the accelerated quark. From the point of view of the quark itself,
   they originate from the thermal medium predicted by the Unruh effect. We
   scrutinize the relation between these two descriptions in the gravity
   side of the correspondence, and show in particular that upon
   transforming the conformal field theory from Rindler space to the open
   Einstein universe, the acceleration horizon disappears from the boundary
   theory but is preserved in the bulk. This transformation allows us to
   directly connect our calculation of radiation-induced fluctuations in
   vacuum with the analysis by de Boer et al. of the Brownian motion of a
   quark that is on average static within a thermal medium. Combining this
   same bulk transformation with previous results of Emparan, we are also
   able to compute the stress-energy tensor of the Unruh thermal medium.},

Abstract = {P>A new analytic solution for the problem of a line source of harmonic
   SH waves that struck a finite 2-D plane crack is introduced. This
   construct is based on Macdonald's solution for the problem of
   cylindrical acoustic waves diffracted by a wedge. We consider this
   approach, since special cases of wedges include semi-infinite cracks.
   The finite crack is assembled by superimposing the effects of two
   semi-infinite cracks. The new solution is obtained by taking into
   account diffracted waves generated at the edges travelling along the
   faces of the crack. Repeated wave fields that result from fitting the
   two cracks are removed. Comparisons with the results obtained with the
   Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM) are shown. Both frequency and
   time domain cases are included.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is considered that hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) occurs with a
   Th1 cell dominance; however, the role of Th1/Th2 balance is still
   unclear. C57BL/6 (Th1-biased), BALB/c wt (Th2-biased) and BALB/c
   Stat6-/- (Th2 deficient) mice were treated with Saccharopolyspora
   rectivirgula (SR) or saline during 3 weeks, and sacrificed 1 and 4 days
   (early and late response) after the last administration. Lung isolated T
   cell subpopulations were analyzed and lung damage extent was quantified.
   C57BL/6 wt mice exhibited a significant increase in the extent of lung
   damage when sacrificed at 4 days compared with those sacrificed 1 day
   after the last SR administration. In contrast, BALB/c wt mice showed a
   progressive decrease in the extent of lung damage. A significant
   increase of NKT CD4+ subset was found in C57BL/6 mice while NKT DN cells
   were increased in BALBc wt mice. Also, NK and gamma delta T cells were
   increased in BALB/c mice at 1 and 4 days. Stat6-/- mice behave similar
   to the C57BL/6 mice, showing a progressive increase in the extent of
   lung damage. A significant increase in the levels of Th1 and Th2
   cytokines was observed in bronchoalveolar lavage from the SR-treated
   mice. These results confirm a predominant role of the Th1 response in HP
   and suggest that the control of inflammation by Th2 biased mice may be
   related with the increase of NKT DN cells and regulatory NM and gamma
   delta T cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Increased understanding of the species-area relationship (SAR) can
   improve its usefulness as a tool for prediction of species loss for
   biodiversity conservation targets. This study was conducted: (i) to
   determine the best plant attribute for the SAR in the community of
   arthropods living within the grass Muhlenbergia robusta; (ii) to
   determine the contribution of phenophases of plant foliage (dry and
   fresh), shade and conspecific distance to the variation in arthropod
   richness within the plant; (iii) to determine the best functional model
   of changes in the abundance, diversity and biomass in communities of
   arthropods in response to increases in plant size; (iv) to determine the
   best host-plant attribute for prediction of these community attributes;
   and (v) to determine the effect of the plant phenophase, shade and M.
   robusta isolation on the abundance, diversity and biomass of the
   arthropod community. The above-ground dry weight of grass was found to
   be the best host-plant attribute for the SAR, while the light
   environment explained the arthropod richness within the grass, with
   higher richness observed in shaded environments. This study also showed
   that the best functional mathematical models for estimation of changes
   in the abundance, dry weight and diversity of arthropods in response to
   increases in grass size (dry weight) are the power model, exponential
   model and logarithmic model, respectively. Furthermore, the host-plant
   foliage phenophase, shade and the isolation of M. robusta with other
   conspecifics had no effect on the abundance, biomass or diversity per
   basal area of the grass.},

Abstract = {Through the seedling emergence method we studied the effects of fire on
   the soil seed bank of a xerophytic shrubland in two consecutive years.
   We compared its composition and abundance in two sites, one burned and
   one unburned. An important proportion of seeds died due to the high
   temperatures reached by fire. In addition, species richness and,
   diversity were also negatively affected. These variables showed
   statistical differences between sites and years. After one year, seed
   bank abundance and diversity reached higher values. Dominant species
   were perennial herbs in terms of species number, and in terms of
   seedling abundance the dominant life form was a tree. However, fire was
   not a determinant factor in terms of species composition. These results
   are important to explain the changes in vegetation after a fire,
   specially if we consider that this site is a natural preserve immersed
   in an urban area.},

Abstract = {Bibliometry of biological systematics in Latin America during the
   twentieth century in three global databases. We present a review of the
   biological systematic research in Latin America during the twentieth
   century, applying a bibliometric analysis to the information contained
   in international databases with the largest number of biological
   records: Biosis (since 1969), CAB (since 1910) and Science Citation
   Index (since 1900), to recognize certain patterns and trends regarding
   the document production. We obtained 19 079 documents and 1 387 journals
   for Biosis, 14326 and 2537 for CAB, 3257 and 1636 for SCI. Of the
   documents, 54.6\% related to new species, 15.3\% dealt with morphology,
   14.9\% keys, 12.5\% descriptions, 10.6\% cases of synonymies, 6\% new
   genera, 4.9\% new geographical. records, 23.6\% geographical
   distribution, 4.2\% redescriptions, and 3.6\% with new nomenclatural
   combinations. The regions mentioned were South America with 11.9\%,
   Central America with 4\% and America (all) with 2.56\%. Nineteen Latin
   American countries appear, whereas outside this region we found the
   United States of America with 12.6\% of representation and Canada with
   3\%. Animals (65.6\%) were the most studied taxa, which was 1.7 times
   higher than what was published for plants (37\%), 11 times higher than
   fungi (6\%) and nearly 30 times higher than microorganisms (2.3\%). Out
   of the 155 journals that produced 66\% of the papers, 76.5\% were better
   represented in Biosis, 21.4\% in CAB and 2\% in SCI. Twenty-nine
   journals published 33\% of the articles, the maximum number of records
   obtained was 69\% for Biosis, CAB 24\% and 6.9\% for SCI, three (10.3\%)
   are in biology, 11(37.9\%) in botany, 13 (44.8\%) zoology, and two
   (6.9\%) paleontology; eight of these journals (27.5\%) were published in
   Latin America and twenty were indexed in the Science Citation Index. In
   the last two years more journals of the region that publish on taxonomy
   have been indexed, but their impact factor is still low. However, the
   impact factor of a number of Latin American journals that published
   biodiversity increased with time. Countries that are more interested in
   studying the Latin American biota from the taxonomic point of view are
   Brazil, the United States, Argentina and Mexico. The most active
   institutions in this discipline were the Universidade de Sao Paulo,
   Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, and the Universidade Federal do
   Rio de Janeiro; together they produced 24\% of the documents. Rev. Biol.

Abstract = {We investigate the properties of the energy spectra of quantum
   one-dimensional nano-quasi-crystals in the presence of external electric
   fields. These systems are modelled by means of finite sequences, ordered
   according to a Fibonacci rule which constituted of two blocks A
   (constant potentials of different heights defined on finite intervals)
   and 8 (delta potentials of different intensities). We use the electric
   field ability of producing Stark ladders in periodic systems to obtain
   well separated energy levels and to study the evolution of these levels
   when disorder is introduced. We show that this effect also allows us to
   predict the approximate position of the levels in the disordered system,
   in spite of its chaotic appearance at first view. We show, against the
   usual belief, that the nth Stark ladder in general is not formed
   exclusively from the levels of the nth band. The disorder is introduced
   in two different ways: by changing the distribution of the blocks or by
   changing the values of the delta potential intensities. In both cases we
   start from electrified periodic structures which are gradually perturbed
   to obtain electrified quasi-periodic structures. We show that the use of
   Fibonacci sequences as a particular case is not crucial and one can use
   the electric field to analyze any other type of quasi-periodic systems.

Abstract = {We studied the community of arthropods inhabiting the ecological
   preserve El Pedregal de San Angel, in Mexico City. We estimated
   morphospecies richness, abundance, and diversity patterns in two
   contrasting habitats, open and closed, during four seasons of the year.
   Because closed-habitat sites have greater net primary productivity than
   open habitats, we predicted arthropod diversity would be greater in
   closed than in open habitats. Morphospecies richness of Acari and
   Arachnida was similar in both types of habitats throughout the year,
   whereas richness of some orders of Insecta such as Coleoptera, Diptera,
   Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera was greatest in open habitats. Mites were the
   most abundant arthropods and were always more abundant in open than
   closed habitats. Diversity of arthropods was greater in closed habitats
   during fall and spring, suggesting that habitat characteristics related
   to primary productivity might affect this community. We suggest that
   studies of patterns of arthropod diversity and factors associated with
   the maintenance of such diversity should be considered in the
   preservation of these organisms and of their natural habitats.},

Abstract = {The taxonomic criteria used as bases for endangered species lists can
   affect conservation policy decisions. We emphasize that the use of
   different taxonomic units affects the baselines of such lists. Recent
   taxonomic reviews for the Mexican avifauna provided the tools for
   assessing this effect on a highly diverse avifauna which is currently in
   need of serious conservation actions. Most ornithologists have used a
   taxonomy based on the biological species concept (BSC) to make decisions
   on species limits and therefore to set them into endangered species
   lists. However, the application of the phylogenetic species concept
   (PSC) as an alternative for delimiting species, results in a different
   panorama of what should be protected. Our analysis shows that the
   current official Mexican endangered species list, BSC based, encompasses
   371 birds, ranked as 277 species and 94 subspecies. The same list of
   protected forms changes under the phylogenetic species concept because
   47 of them are not recognized as valid species, while another 28 forms
   merit higher levels of protection. Additionally, under this concept
   another :11 forms should be candidates for inclusion based on their
   restricted distribution. We call attention to the fact that the use of
   one or another species concept affects endangered species lists.},

Abstract = {We propose an improved effective-medium theory to obtain the
   concentration dependence of the viscosity of particle suspensions at
   arbitrary volume fractions Our methodology can be applied, in principle,
   to any particle shape as long as the intrinsic viscosity is known in the
   dilute limit and the particles are not too elongated. The procedure
   allows to construct a continuum-medium model in which correlations
   between the particles are introduced through an effective volume
   fraction We have tested the procedure using spheres, ellipsoids,
   cylinders, dumbells, and other complex shapes. In the case of hard
   spherical particles, our expression improves considerably previous
   models like the widely used Krieger-Dougherty relation. The final

Abstract = {We studied the demography of nine populations of the epiphyte Tillandsia
   recurvata established on Prosopis laevigata in the Tehuacan region, in
   the Mexican state of Puebla, to evaluate whether they show demographic
   asynchrony, a basic condition for metapopulation persistence. These
   populations differed in the size of the occupied tree (volume of tree
   crown) and in their number of individuals. Two Lefkovitch matrices were
   built per population, one for 2001-2 and another one for 2002-3.
   Population structured differed between populations: those established on
   small trees had a higher seedling proportion whereas those on larger
   trees were dominated by adults. The projected lambda values varied
   between populations and years, but no pattern was found to this
   variation, with the exception that there was a positive correlation
   between lambda. and population size for 2002-3. Population demography
   was asynchronous between populations, thus favouring metapopulation
   persistence.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {132},
Number = {19},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {We propose that the main mechanism controlling the selection rule of
   model (dis)orderly protein formations, such as non-Kossel crystal growth
   and aggregation of lysozyme from aqueous solution, is an ion-channeling
   filter having flicker-noise properties. This filter is originated at the
   interfaces between growing solidlike object and its external liquid-type
   phase, and it can be considered as a series of voltage gated ion
   subchannels. The dynamics of each channel is studied by using both
   simulation and analytic argumentation lines, and represents a novel
   thought on how to utilize the presence of constructive-noise sources in
   protein formation, a field of utmost experimental and technological
   interest. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Title = {Mixed layer depth variability in the tropical boundary of the California
   Current, 1997-2007},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {The variability of the mixed layer depth (MLD) is examined over a decade
   (1997-2007) for the tropical boundary of the California Current (24-32
   degrees N), using conductivity-temperature-depth observations collected
   by quarterly survey cruises. Results indicate that salinity gradients
   control MLD rather than temperature gradients. The mean state of the
   upper ocean indicates that contours of constant MLD are parallel to the
   coast, with mixed layer thickness decreasing toward the coastal zone.
   The deepest (similar to 70 m) thickness is reached in January and the
   shallowest (similar to 15 m) occurs in July. The warmer conditions
   (summer) are reproduced for a simple thermal energy equation. The rest
   of the seasons are reproduced for a one-dimensional momentum balance for
   the upper ocean, which includes Ekman dynamics and stratification. This
   comparison indicates that the variability of MLD is mainly due to
   wind-driven phenomena except during the heating period. In particular,
   seasonal and interannual variability of the MLD are correlated with
   offshore Ekman transport. An abrupt MLD change occurs between January
   1998 and January 2000 associated with the strong El Nino-La Nina cycle
   shift that occurred in this period.},

Abstract = {It is predicted that climate change will cause species extinctions and
   distributional shifts in coming decades, but data to validate these
   predictions are relatively scarce. Here, we compare recent and
   historical surveys for 48 Mexican lizard species at 200 sites. Since
   1975, 12\% of local populations have gone extinct. We verified
   physiological models of extinction risk with observed local extinctions
   and extended projections worldwide. Since 1975, we estimate that 4\% of
   local populations have gone extinct worldwide, but by 2080 local
   extinctions are projected to reach 39\% worldwide, and species
   extinctions may reach 20\%. Global extinction projections were validated
   with local extinctions observed from 1975 to 2009 for regional biotas on
   four other continents, suggesting that lizards have already crossed a
   threshold for extinctions caused by climate change.},

Abstract = {Seasonal changes in the environment are known to be important drivers of
   population dynamics, giving rise to sustained population cycles.
   However, it is often difficult to measure the strength and shape of
   seasonal forces affecting populations. In recent years, statistical
   time-series methods have been applied to the incidence records of
   childhood infectious diseases in an attempt to estimate seasonal
   variation in transmission rates, as driven by the pattern of school
   terms. In turn, school-term forcing was used to show how susceptible
   influx rates affect the interepidemic period. In this paper, we document
   the response of measles dynamics to distinct shifts in the parameter
   regime using previously unexplored records of measles mortality from the
   early decades of the twentieth century. We describe temporal patterns of
   measles epidemics using spectral analysis techniques, and point out a
   marked decrease in birth rates over time. Changes in host demography
   alone do not, however, suffice to explain epidemiological transitions.
   By fitting the time-series susceptible-infected-recovered model to
   measles mortality data, we obtain estimates of seasonal transmission in
   different eras, and find that seasonality increased over time. This
   analysis supports theoretical work linking complex population dynamics
   and the balance between stochastic and deterministic forces as
   determined by the strength of seasonality.},

Abstract = {Fungi may be selected as models for gene expression studies and further
   adaptation for biotechnological enzyme production. The aim of this work
   was to evaluate laccase production and to analyze the effect of Cu2+ on
   selected fungi natives of Misiones, Ganoderma applanatum (strain F),
   Peniophora sp. (BAFC 633), Pycnoporus sanguineus (BAFC 2126) and
   Coriolus versicolor f. antarcticus (BAFC 266). Fungi secretion system of
   G. applanatum, Peniophora sp., P. sanguineus and C versicolor f.
   antarcticus is sensitive to stimulation by copper. Biomass values of G.
   applanatum, Peniophora sp. and C. versicolor f. antarcticus did not show
   differences between treatments. P. sanguineus biomass underwent a
   dramatic growth inhibition with 1 mM Cu2+ and marked delay in growth
   with 0.5 mM Cu2+. Proteins were increased with copper in Peniophora sp.,
   C. versicolor and G. applanatum. G. applanatum and Peniophora sp.
   reached the highest enzyme activity at 10th day equivalent to 49.2-fold
   and 19.7-fold higher than the control samples, respectively. Copper
   produced an increase of constitutive laccases in all fungi and an
   additional inducible isoenzyme in Peniophora sp., C. versicolor f.
   antarcticus and G. applanatum. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   includes sampling carried out at seven elevations. Calculated indices
   were: species richness (S), Shannon's diversity index (H'), Pielou's
   evenness index (J') and Simpson dominance (lambda). A linear regression
   analysis was made to evaluate the effect of elevation on the total
   springtail density. The total number of species was 30, with 18 species
   from the lowest elevation and 9 species from the highest. The greatest
   density was obtained at the highest elevation. Pseudisotoma Willowsia
   mexicana and Americabrya arida were the dominant species, and there is a
   positive significant relationship between the elevation and their
   density. The greatest similarity between communities in agreement with
   dendrogram is near 80\% between elevations of 3,115 and 3,250m.},

   spectroscopy was used to determine the ionic state of the Fe ions and
   the hyperfine fields. The magnetic susceptibility curves of the samples
   with x=0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 show superconducting behavior. The lattice
