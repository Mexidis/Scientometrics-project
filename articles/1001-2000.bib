Abstract = {The discussion on the existence of prokaryotic species is reviewed. The
   demonstration that several different mechanisms of genetic exchange and
   recombination exist has led some to a radical rejection of the
   possibility of bacterial species and, in general, the applicability of
   traditional classification categories to the prokaryotic domains.
   However, in spite of intense gene traffic, prokaryotic groups are not
   continuously variable but form discrete clusters of phenotypically
   coherent, well-defined, diagnosable groups of individual organisms.
   Molecularization of life sciences has led to biased approaches to the
   issue of the origins of biodiversity, which has resulted in the
   increasingly extended tendency to emphasize genes and sequences and not
   give proper attention to organismal biology. As argued here, molecular
   and organismal approaches that should be seen as complementary and not
   opposed views of biology.},

Title = {The Definition of Life: A Brief History of an Elusive Scientific

Abstract = {In spite of the spectacular developments in our understanding of the
   molecular basis that underlies biological phenomena, we still lack a
   generally agreed-upon definition of life, but this is not for want of
   trying. Life is an empirical concept; and, as suggested by the many
   unsuccessful efforts to define it, this task is likely to remain, at
   best, a work in progress. Although phenomenological characterizations of
   life are feasible, a precise definition of life remains an elusive
   intellectual endeavor. This is not surprising: as Nietszche once wrote,
   there are concepts that can be defined, whereas others only have a
   history. The purpose of this essay is to discuss some of the manifold
   (and often unsatisfactory) definitions of life that have been attempted
   from different intellectual and scientific perspectives and reflect, at
   least in part, the key role that historical frameworks play. Although
   some efforts have been more fruitful, the lack of an all-embracing,
   generally agreed-upon definition of life sometimes gives the impression
   that what is meant by life's origin is defined in somewhat imprecise
   terms and that several entirely different questions are often confused.
   The many attempts made to reduce the nature of living systems to a
   single living compound imply that life can be so well defined that the
   exact point at which it started can be established with the sudden
   appearance of the first replicating molecule. On the other hand, if the
   emergence of life is seen as the stepwise (but not necessarily slow)
   evolutionary transition between the non-living and the living, then it
   may be meaningless to draw a strict line between them.},

Title = {Historical Development of Origins Research},
Journal = {COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Following the publication of the Origin of Species in 1859, many
   naturalists adopted the idea that living organisms were the historical
   outcome of gradual transformation of lifeless matter. These views soon
   merged with the developments of biochemistry and cell biology and led to
   proposals in which the origin of protoplasm was equated with the origin
   of life. The heterotrophic origin of life proposed by Oparin and Haldane
   in the 1920s was part of this tradition, which Oparin enriched by
   transforming the discussion of the emergence of the first cells into a
   workable multidisciplinary research program.
   On the other hand, the scientific trend toward understanding biological
   phenomena at the molecular level led authors like Troland, Muller, and
   others to propose that single molecules or viruses represented
   primordial living systems. The contrast between these opposing views on
   the origin of life represents not only contrasting views of the nature
   of life itself, but also major ideological discussions that reached a
   surprising intensity in the years following Stanley Miller's seminal
   result which showed the ease with which organic compounds of biochemical
   significance could be synthesized under putative primitive conditions.
   In fact, during the years following the Miller experiment, attempts to
   understand the origin of life were strongly influenced by research on
   DNA replication and protein biosynthesis, and, in socio-political terms,
   by the atmosphere created by Cold War tensions.
   The catalytic versatility of RNA molecules clearly merits a critical
   reappraisal of Muller's viewpoint. However, the discovery of ribozymes
   does not imply that autocatalytic nucleic acid molecules ready to be
   used as primordial genes were floating in the primitive oceans, or that
   the RNA world emerged completely assembled from simple precursors
   present in the prebiotic soup. The evidence supporting the presence of a
   wide range of organic molecules on the primitive Earth, including
   membrane-forming compounds, suggests that the evolution of
   membrane-bounded molecular systems preceded cellular life on our planet,
   and that life is the evolutionary outcome of a process, not of a single,
   fortuitous event.},

Abstract = {We characterized the tree seedling community within seven forest
   fragments of different size (3-640 ha) at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We
   considered individual density, species richness, diversity, composition
   and functional group (shade tolerant, non-pioneer-light demander and
   pioneer species). We recorded 8038 individuals, belonging to 128 species
   and 40 morphospecies. Overall, shade-tolerant species had the highest
   density and diversity followed by non-pioneer-light demanders and
   pioneer species. Mean individual density per plot was not related to
   fragment size, but mean species richness per plot, total observed
   species richness and diversity were inversely related to fragment size,
   with the smallest fragments having the highest values. Species
   composition comparisons highlighted low similarity among fragments.
   Furthermore, larger fragments shared more species with the smallest
   fragments than between each other. Our results show that the largest
   fragments do not always hold the highest species richness; that small
   fragments comprise of high seedling species diversity, and represent a
   high regeneration potential for tree native species in the study
   landscape. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {When Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species 150 years ago he
   consciously avoided discussing the origin of life. However, analysis of
   some other texts written by Darwin, and of the correspondence he
   exchanged with friends and colleagues demonstrates that he took for
   granted the possibility of a natural emergence of the first life forms.
   As shown by notes from the pages he excised from his private notebooks,
   as early as 1837 Darwin was convinced that ``the intimate relation of
   Life with laws of chemical combination, \& the universality of latter
   render spontaneous generation not improbable{''}. Like many of his
   contemporaries, Darwin rejected the idea that putrefaction of
   preexisting organic compounds could lead to the appearance of organisms.
   Although he favored the possibility that life could appear by natural
   processes from simple inorganic compounds, his reluctance to discuss the
   issue resulted from his recognition that at the time it was possible to
   undertake the experimental study of the emergence of life.},

Abstract = {Charcoal recovered from different archaeological excavations carried out
   in the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico was used to evaluate whether
   significant changes in the use of wood took place through time (approx.
   400 B.C.-A.D. 1500). Sixteen taxa of trees and shrubs characteristic of
   the Basin of Mexico were identified (including Pinus, Quercus, Arbutus,
   Cupressaceae, Alnus, Prunus, Taxodiunt, Salix, Baccharis and Buddleia,
   among others). Variations in the proportions of taxa are interpreted as
   a reflection of the intensity of use rather than an indicator of
   deforestation. The analysis of the data shows a pattern of continuity in
   the utilization of taxa throughout the occupation. This includes the use
   of different vegetative parts (trunk and branches), genera and species
   with different life forms (trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants) and primary
   (Pinus and Quercus) as well as secondary taxa (Prunus and Arbutus). We
   propose that the inhabitants of the Teotihuacan Valley implemented
   practices to manage vegetation in order to assure resource availability
   in the region. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The intellectual development of scientists normally traverses several
   different phases as they mature in their professions. In many cases,
   strong support of certain ideas and theories gives way to more critical,
   productive views that set the stage for major theories and discoveries.
   This appears to have been the case of Santiago Ramon y Cajal
   (1852-1934). In his youth, he supported the protoplasmic theory of life,
   and as he matured he maintained a critical, yet open view of the cell
   theory, which postulated that life phenomena could not take place below
   the cellular level. In later years, however, an older and wiser Ramon y
   Cajal abandoned all traces of dissent and joined in fully supporting a
   refined version of cell theory, to which his own discoveries
   significantly contributed.},

Title = {The origin of a novel gene through overprinting in Escherichia
   coli},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Background: Overlapped genes originate by a) loss of a stop codon among
   contiguous genes coded in different frames; b) shift to an upstream
   initiation codon of one of the contiguous genes; or c) by overprinting,
   whereby a novel open reading frame originates through point mutation
   inside an existing gene. Although overlapped genes are common in
   viruses, it is not clear whether overprinting has led to new genes in
   prokaryotes.
   Results: Here we report the origin of a new gene through overprinting in
   Escherichia coli K12. The htgA gene coding for a positive regulator of
   the sigma 32 heat shock promoter arose by point mutation in a 123/213
   phase within an open reading frame (yaaW) of unknown function, most
   likely in the lineage leading to E. coli and Shigella sp. Further, we
   show that yaaW sequences coding for htgA genes have a slower
   evolutionary rate than those lacking an overlapped htgA gene.
   Conclusion: While overprinting has been shown to be rather frequent in
   the evolution of new genes in viruses, our results suggest that this
   mechanism has also contributed to the origin of a novel gene in a
   prokaryote. We propose the term janolog (from Jano, the two-faced Roman
   god) to describe the homology relationship that holds between two genes
   when one originated through overprinting of the other. One cannot
   dismiss the possibility that at least a small fraction of the large
   number of novel ORPhan genes detected in pan-genome and metagenomic
   studies arose by overprinting.},

   transfer events, as well as sequences that have originated in different

   conserved genes involved in RNA metabolism provide insights into early
   stages of cell evolution during which RNA played a much more conspicuous
   biological role, and is consistent with the hypothesis that extant
   living systems were preceded by an RNA/protein world. Insights into the
   traits of primitive entities from which the LCA evolved may be derived
   from the analysis of paralogous gene families, including those formed by
   sequences that resulted from internal elongation events. Three major
   types of paralogous gene families can be recognized. The importance of
   this grouping for understanding the traits of early cells is discussed.},

Abstract = {Protein disulfide oxidoreductases (PDOs) are redox enzymes that catalyze
   dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Their sequences and structure
   reveal the presence of two thioredoxin fold units, each of which is
   endowed with a catalytic site CXXC motif. PDOs are the outcome of an
   ancient gene duplication event. They have been described in a number of
   thermophilic and hyperthermophilic species, where they play a critical
   role in the structural stabilization of intracellular proteins. PDOs are
   homologous to both the N-terminal domain of the bacterial alkyl
   hydroperoxide reductase (AhpF) and to the eukaryotic protein disulfide
   isomerase (PDI). Phylogenetic analysis of PDOs suggests that they first
   evolved in the crenarchaeota, spreading from them into the Bacteria via
   the euryarchaeota. These results imply that the last common ancestor
   (LCA) of all extant living beings lacked a PDO and argue, albeit weakly,
   against a thermophilic LCA.},

Abstract = {In this work we study mechanical systems defined by homogeneous
   polynomial potentials of degree 4 on the plane, when the potential has a
   definite or semi-definite sign and the energy is non-negative. We get a
   global description of the flow for the non-negative potential case. Some
   partial results are obtained for the more complicated case of
   non-positive potentials. In contrast with the non-negative case, we
   prove that the flow is complete and we find special periodic solutions,
   whose stability is analyzed. By using results from Ziglin theory
   following Morales-Ruiz and Ramis we check the non-integrability of the
   Hamiltonian systems in terms of the potential parameters.},

Title = {Floristic and structural contrasts between natural savannas and
   anthropogenic pastures in a tropical dry landscape},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-190},
Abstract = {The magnitude of the biological differentiation between natural savannas
   and pastures (anthropogenic grasslands) coexisting in a single
   landscape, in terms of their floristic composition and community
   structure, was studied in the Nizanda region, Isthmus of Tehuantepec,
   Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. Vegetation samples of 15 m(2) each were
   taken at 20 savanna and 11 pasture sites. Cover- and species
   richness-based diversity and dominance indices were calculated.
   Geomorphological and edaphic characteristics were also compared.
   Savannas generally occurred in hill summits with very shallow and stony,
   discontinuous and acidic soils; contrastingly, pastures were located in
   piedmonts and foodplains, with more neutral and less stony soils.
   Savanna sites differed from pasture sites in species richness and
   Shannon diversity. They did not differ in Simpson dominance index, but
   the identity of the dominant species was different in each community:
   Trachypogon spicatus (L. f.) Kuntze in savanna and Megathyrsus maximus
   (Jacq.) B. K. Simon et S. W. L. Jacobs in pasture. A low species-level
   similarity (Sorensen Index) was observed between them (8.2\%), and
   genus-level similarity was only slightly higher (27.1\%). The magnitude
   of the biological differentiation in both community floristics and
   structure between these two grass-dominated communities was larger than
   anticipated. Current management of savannas as pasture lands may
   potentially trigger a severe deterioration process involving both the
   landscape and its plant components.},

Abstract = {There is a lack of information on monitoring neurotoxicity in offshore
   commercial species. To help fill this gap, we sampled hake (Merluccius
   merluccius) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) in fishing grounds
   off the coast of l'Ametlla de Mar (NW Mediterranean) in June 2005 at a
   depth of 100 in and 400 in. Additionally, at 400 in depth, two other
   fish species, Micromesistius poutassou and Phycis blennoides were
   included. Neurotoxicity markers such as Colinesterases (ChEs), namely
   acethyl- (AChE), butyryl- (BChE), propionyl- (PrChE) and
   carboxilesterase (CbE) were measured in muscle. Lipid peroxidation (LP),
   a marker of oxidative damage, was also included. The results are
   discussed in relation to the animal's sex, size and fishing depth. A
   comparison of esterases and LP levels between muscle and liver of hake
   and between muscle and hepatopancreas of Norway Lobster was made. AChE
   was dominant in muscle and CbE in hepatopancreas. No differences between
   fish species were seen for AChE. However, N. norvegicus, presented lower
   levels of ChEs and LP. A size-dependence in ChEs was seen for M.
   merluccius, with larger animals showing significantly lower activities
   (p < 0.05). Sex-dependence was seen in N. norvegicus for most esterases,
   except AChE, with males displaying higher activities (p < 0.05). A
   sampling-depth effect was also seen in the crustacea, with animals from
   100 in generally presenting lower esterase activities and higher LP
   levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Theoretical prediction of nuclear masses is analyzed as a pattern
   recognition problem on the N-Z plane. A global pattern is observed by
   plotting the differences between measured masses and Liquid Drop Model
   (LDM) predictions. After unfolding the data by removing the smooth LDM
   mass contributions, the remaining microscopic effects have proved
   difficult to model, although they display a striking pattern. These
   deviations carry information related to shell closures, nuclear
   deformation and the residual nuclear interactions. In the present work
   the more than 2000 known nuclear masses are studied as an array in the
   N-Z plane viewed through a mask, behind which the approximately 7000
   unknown unstable nuclei that can exist between the proton and neutron
   drip lines are hidden. We show here that employing a Fourier transform

Abstract = {We analyze the dynamics of a Brownian gas in contact with a heat bath in
   which large temperature fluctuations occur. There are two distinct time
   scales present, one describes the decay of the fluctuations in the
   temperature and the other one is associated with the establishment of
   local equilibrium. Although the gas has reached local equilibrium, there
   exist large fluctuations in an intensive parameter (temperature) which
   break the thermodynamic equilibrium with the heat bath. Thus the decay
   time of the fluctuations in the intensive parameter is larger than the
   characteristic time for the establishment of local equilibrium. We show
   that the dynamics of such large and intensive fluctuations may be
   described by adopting a nonequilibrium thermodynamics approach with an
   adequate formulation of local equilibrium. A coarsening procedure is
   then used to contract the space of mesoscopic variables needed to
   describe the dynamics of the gas and the extensive character of the
   description is lost. This procedure allows us to derive an effective
   Maxwell-Boltzmann factor (EMBF) for the Brownian gas, as has been
   recently proposed in the literature {[}C. Beck, E.G.D. Cohen, Physica A
   322 (2003) 267-275]. Furthermore, we use this local equilibrium
   distribution and an entropy functional to derive a nonequilibrium
   probability distribution and a hydrodynamic description for the Brownian
   gas which contains fluctuating transport coefficients. The ensuing
   description is nonextensive and our analysis shows that the
   coarse-graining procedure is responsible for the nonextensivity
   property. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Coexistence and divergence of tropical dry forests and savannas in
   southern Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Aim: The purpose of the study was to assess the degree of floristic
   differentiation between tropical dry forest (TDF) and savanna occurring
   in a single landscape. This comparison provides information on the
   responses of vegetation to the prevailing environmental conditions,
   while it also allows us to make inferences about large-scale events and
   processes, both biogeographical and evolutionary. Our approach included
   three levels of analysis: (1) taxonomic, (2) morphological and (3)
   vegetational.
   Location: The seasonal dry tropical landscape in the Nizanda region,
   Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. The landscape comprises a complex
   vegetation mosaic in which tropical dry forest and savannas are the most
   conspicuous components.
   Methods: Comparisons between TDF and savanna were based on inventories
   for these communities produced after 8 years of botanical survey. At the
   taxonomic level, the relative representation of taxa of different
   hierarchical levels in each community was examined. Morphological
   analyses required the classification of species on each of three
   criteria: (1) growth form, (2) life form and (3) growth habit.
   Vegetation level analysis was based on the frequencies of taxa in one
   hundred 100-m(2) composition plots with which matrices of binary data
   were constructed for species, genera and families. These were subjected
   to classification analysis with Ward's method and using Euclidean
   distances as the dissimilarity algorithm.
   Results: The combined flora for both communities comprised 600 species,
   375 genera and 94 families; between them they shared 31, 40 and 34 taxa,
   respectively. The corresponding Sorensen similarity values were 10\%,
   21\% and 72\%, respectively. Ranking genera and families according to
   their species richness displayed large differences between savanna and
   TDF. Large differences between these communities were observed for
   Acanthaceae, Cactaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Mimosaceae, whereas Fabaceae
   and Asteraceae had similar high ranks according to the species richness
   in the two systems. The growth form spectrum diverged between the two
   communities, with TDF having more trees, shrubs and climbers. Savanna
   was characterised by forbs and graminoid herbs. Growth habit spectra
   revealed a clear dominance of herbaceous and suffruticose plants in
   savanna, and of woody elements and epiphytes in TDF. Regarding
   Raunkiaer's life forms, savanna had relatively more hemicryptophytes,
   and TDF more phanerophytes. Classification analyses showed that savanna
   and TDF forest samples kept their identities, regardless of taxonomic
   level (species, genera and families) at which the analyses were
   performed.
   Main conclusions: The TDF and savanna of Nizanda represent two floristic
   systems with a large degree of differentiation at all taxonomic levels
   and patterns of morphological attributes. This suggest that the two
   floristic sets have evolved independently for extended periods of time,
   despite their close proximity. One important implication of this
   floristic differentiation is the large joint contribution made by these
   communities to the regional flora.},

Abstract = {A bioactivity-guided chemical Study of aerial parts of Croton
   ciliatoglanduliferus Ort. led to the isolation for the first time of the
   flavonoids retusin (5-hydroxy-3,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone) (1) and
   pachypodol (5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,3'-trimethoxyflavone) (2) from the
   n-hexane extract. Compounds 1 and 2 were separated by preparative
   thin-layer chromatography. Compound 2 was the most active compound on
   ATP synthesis inhibition. The I-50 value was 51 mu M. Pachypodol behaves
   as a Hill reaction inhibitor. It inhibited the uncoupled electron flow
   on photosystem II partial reaction from water to dichlorophenol
   indophenol (DCPIP) and from water to sodium silicomolybdate. However,
   the uncoupled partial reaction from diphenylcarbazide to DCPIP and the
   uncoupled photosystem I from DCPIPred to MV were not inhibited by 2.
   These results were corroborated by fluorescence decay data. Therefore,
   pachypodol inhibits the water-splitting enzyme activity. Compound 1 with
   a 4'-methoxy group was a weak inhibitor, indicating that the 4' free -OH
   group is important for strong inhibition.},

Abstract = {In this article, the Kubo-Greenwood formula is used to investigate the
   electronic transport behaviour in macroscopic systems by means of an
   exact renormalization method. The convolution technique is employed in
   the analysis of two-dimensional Fibonacci lattices. The dc electrical
   conductance spectra of multidimensional systems exhibit a quantized
   behaviour when the electric field is applied along a periodically
   arranged atomic direction, and it becomes a devil's stair if the
   perpendicular subspace of the system is quasiperiodic. The spectrally
   averaged conductance shows a power-law decay as the system length grows,
   neither constant as in periodic systems nor exponential decays occurred
   in randomly disordered lattices, revealing the critical localization
   nature of the eigenstates in quasicrystals. Finally, the ac conductance
   along periodic and quasiperiodic directions is compared with the optical
   conductivity measured in decagonal quasicrystals.},

Abstract = {Tillandsia recurvata L. is an atmospheric epiphyte that occupies tree
   canopies in many parts of tropical America. We investigated the host
   preferences of this species by analyzing its occurrence on trees in a
   1-ha plot in a semi-desert environment in Mexico. Additionally, we
   carried out germination experiments and recorded seedling survival and
   growth in different microsites on the three preferred host species. Our
   results indicate that T. recurvata occupies the crowns of certain host
   species (Prosopis laevigata (Humb. \& Bonpl. ex Willd.) M.C. Harms,
   Acacia bilimekii Macbr., and Cercidium praecox (Ruiz \& Pav.) Harms)
   with a higher frequency than expected by chance. In addition to species
   identity, tree size affected the probability of being occupied: small
   trees were occupied with lower frequencies and with lower densities than
   larger ones. On the other hand, distance to the nearest colonized tree
   was not related to the probability of a tree being occupied. Seed
   germination ranged from 0\% to 7.5\% and did not differ among the three
   host species tested. However, both seed germination and seedling growth
   were higher in the outer and upper parts of tree crowns. Given the
   patchy distribution of this epiphyte, we propose this system may be
   viewed as a metapopulation in which patch suitability varies according
   to host identity and size.},

Abstract = {Thin films of crude oil samples were prepared for atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) analysis on the gold substrate. Sample preparation
   involved evaporation during a long (24 h) but mild thermal exposure (80
   degrees C). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy (reflectance
   spectroscopy) was employed to determinate the quality of the thin film
   surface, before the morphology characterization. The surface reflectance
   spectra were compared to direct transmittance FTIR of liquid oil
   samples. The two FTIR techniques showed different spectral
   characteristics related to oxygenated functionalities. This clearly
   indicated that the surface of the thin films of the oil samples prepared
   for AFM is oxidized. Oil samples of different origin show different
   degrees of oxidation seen by the development of carboxylic acid
   vibrations at 1750 cm(-1) as well as vibrations in the 13001100 cm-1
   region. The relative degree of oxidation state was compared to surface
   morphology data by AFM previously reported. The reported results
   emphasize the advantage of complementary techniques (AFM/FTIR
   microscopy) in the analysis of petroleum thin films that should be
   considered during analysis and interpretation of this type of data.},

Abstract = {The nucleolus is the main site for synthesis and processing of ribosomal
   RNA in eukaryotes. In mammals, plants, and yeast the nucleolus has been
   extensively characterized by electron microscopy, but in the majority of
   the unicellular eukaryotes no such studies have been performed. Here we
   used ultrastructural cytochemical and immunocytochemical techniques as
   well as three-dimensional reconstruction to analyze the nucleolus of
   Trypanosoma cruzi., which is an early divergent eukaryote of medical
   importance. In T. cruzi epimastigotes the nucleolus is a spherical
   intranuclear ribonucleoprotein organelle localized in a relatively
   central position within the nucleus. Dense fibrillar and granular
   components but not fibrillar centers were observed. In addition, nuclear
   bodies resembling Cajal bodies were observed associated to the nucleolus
   in the surrounding nucleoplasm. Our results provide additional
   morphological data to better understand the synthesis and processing of
   the ribosomal RNA in kinetoplastids.},

Abstract = {The polymerization of concentrated NH4CN solutions has been studied at
   various temperatures and ammonia concentrations. The products of the
   oligomerization of ammonium cyanide include adenine and guanine, as well
   as trace amounts of 2,6-diaminopurine. Our results indicate that the
   adenine yield is not strongly dependent on temperature. Guanine is
   produced in lower yield. The original studies by Oro and Kimball (1961)
   showed that the 6 N HCl hydrolysis of the NH4CN polymerization
   supernatant greatly increased the adenine yield. However, this
   hydrolysis also decomposes adenine and other purines. Therefore, we have
   measured the yields from an NH4CN polymerization as a function of
   hydrolysis time, and found that shorter hydrolytic periods give higher
   yields of adenine. We have also investigated the hydrolysis of the
   supernatant at pH 8, which is a more reasonable model of primitive
   oceanic conditions, and found that the adenine yield is comparable to
   that obtained with acid hydrolysis (approximately 0.1\%). The yield of
   adenine does not decline at longer hydrolysis times because of the
   greater stability of adenine at pH 8. The insoluble black polymer formed
   from NH4CN has been analyzed by both acid and neutral hydrolysis. In
   both cases adenine yields of approximately 0.05\% were obtained. This
   suggests that the polymer may have been as important a prebiotic source
   of purines as the usually analyzed supernatant.},

Abstract = {In Mexico and other countries, cultivation of pitahaya (Hylocereus spp.)
   is considered very promising because its fruit is well accepted and it
   is resistant to drought. However, new plantations in Mexico have several
   problems, including genetic heterogeneity of plantation material and low
   fruit production relative to total flower production of some genotypes.
   Knowing biodiversity of a plant resource allows election of strategies
   for better use. This motivated the study of five genotypes (1, 3, 4, 5
   and 6) cultivated in southern Quintana Roo, Mexico, to characterize
   their morphology and evaluate their sexual compatibility. The
   morphological characterization was determined with quantitative
   variables (length and diameter) of flower, fruit, stem, seed and pollen,
   as well as with color of the pericarp (qualitative variable). Sexual
   compatibility was evaluated with self-pollination. The genotypes were
   differentiated mainly by the characteristics of their reproductive
   structures. Based on an analysis of variance, clusters and principal
   components, it was determined that genotypes 1, 3 and 6 have similar
   characteristics in their reproductive structures, while genotypes 4 and
   5 have more differences. Genotypes I and 5 were self-compatible and have
   more productive potential for the region because of the characteristics
   of their fruits.},

Title = {Prebiological evolution and the physics of the origin of life},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF LIFE REVIEWS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-64},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The basic tenet of the heterotrophic theory of the origin of life is
   that the maintenance and reproduction of the first living systems
   depended primarily on prebiotically synthesized organic molecules. It is
   unlikely that any single mechanism can account for the wide range of
   organic compounds that may have accumulated on the primitive Earth,
   suggesting that the prebiotic soup was formed by contributions from
   endogenous syntheses in reducing environments. metal sulphide-mediated
   synthesis in deep-sea vents, and exogenous sources such as comets,
   meteorites and interplanetary dust. The wide range of experimental
   conditions under which amino acids and nucleobases can be synthesized
   suggests that the abiotic syntheses of these monomers did not take place
   under a narrow range defined by highly selective reaction conditions,
   but rather under a wide variety of settings. The robustness of this type
   of chemistry is supported by the occurrence of most of these biochemical
   compounds in the Murchison meteorite. These results lend strong credence
   to the hypothesis that the emergence of life was the outcome of a long,
   but not necessarily slow evolutionary processes. The origin of life may
   be best understood in terms of the dynamics and evolution of sets (if
   chemical replicating entities. Whether such entities were enclosed
   within membranes is not yet clear, but given the prebiotic availability
   of amphiphilic compounds this may have well been the case. This scheme
   is not at odds with the theoretical models of self-organized emerging
   systems, but what is known of biology suggest that the essential traits
   of living systems could have not emerged in the absence of genetic
   material able to store, express and, upon a replication, transmit to its
   progeny information capable of undergoing evolutionary change. How such
   genetic polymer first evolved is a central issue in origin-of-life
   studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   (2) S(p)=\{q is an element of omega{*}:There Exists f is an element of
   omega(omega), strictly increasing, such that q=f(beta)(p)\},
   (3) I(p)-the set of strong Rudin-Blass predecessors of p,
   (4) R(p)-the set of ultrafilters equivalent to p in the strong
   Rudin-Blass order,
   (5) P-RB(p)-the set of Rudin-Blass predecessors of p, and
   (6) P-RK(p)-the set of Rudin-Keisler predecessors of p,
   and analyze relationships between them. We introduce the semi-P-points
   as those ultrafilters p is an element of omega{*} for which
   P-RB(p)=P-RK(p), and investigate their relations with P-points,
   weak-P-points and Q-points. In particular, we prove that for every
   semi-P-point p its alpha-th left power (alpha)p is a semi-P-point, and
   we prove that non-semi-P-points exist in ZFC. Further, we define an
   order < in T(p) by r < q if and only if r is an element of S(q). We
   prove that (S(p),<) is always downwards directed, (R(p), <) is always
   downwards and upwards directed, and (T(p), <) is linear if and only if p
   is selective.
   We also characterize rapid ultrafilters as those ultrafilters p is an
   element of omega{*} for which R(p)\textbackslash{}S(p) is a dense subset
   of omega{*}.
   A space X is M-pseudocompact (for M subset of omega{*}) if for every
   sequence (U-n)(n<omega) of disjoint open subsets of X, there are q is an
   element of M and x is an element of X such that x=q-lim (U-n); that is,
   \{n<omega:V boolean AND U-n not equal phi\} is an element of q for every
   neighborhood V of x. The P-RK(p)-pseudocompact spaces were studied in
   {[}ST].
   In this article we analyze M-pseudocompactness when M is one of the
   classes S(p), R(p), T(p), I(p), P-RB(p) and P-RK(p). We prove that every
   Frolik space is S(p)-pseudocompact for every p is an element of
   omega{*}, and determine when a subspace X subset of beta omega with
   omega subset of X is M-pseudocompact.},

Abstract = {Changes in forest cover during a 16-year period were evaluated by means
   of a post-classification digital change detection process in a site to
   the southwest of the basin of Mexico City. Post-classification was
   prefer-red over other change detection methods since it offers the
   advantage of indicating the nature of changes, such as forest to
   shrubland, to cropland, or to other land uses. Overall classification
   accuracy ranges from 59.8 percent to 70.2 percent, and the multivariate
   measure of classification accuracy from 0.55 to 0.66 (kappa
   coefficient). The forest coverage maps obtained for 1973, 1985, and 1989
   show an 18 percent deforestation in that period in that area. The
   derived annual deforestation rates, expressed as the percentage of
   remaining forest that is cleared per year, were 0.5 percent for the
   interval 1973-1985 and 3.4 percent for 1985-1989. A digital elevation
   model (DEM) and derived slope gradient, and slope aspect maps, were
   useful in the digital classification adjustment. The digital change
   detection performed herein only reported quantities of lost forest, but
   fieldwork observations indicate some regions of the remaining forest are
   already severely affected. Hence, further research on the type of
   changes, and general vigor of the forest or its degradation level, are
   required to evaluate the full impact of forest destruction in other
   areas, such as aquifer recharge.},

Abstract = {The organic plant extracts of 21 species of Clusiaceae from Mexico were
   screened for anti HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity in a
   non-radioactive immuno colorimetric assay. The extracts of 5 species
   (23.8\%) exhibited significant inhibition ( greater than or equal
   to70\%) of HIV-1 RT activity; of these, only 4 extracts showed reduced
   toxicity to human lymphocytic MT2 cells and were further tested as
   inhibitors of HIV-1 IIIb/LAV replication in a cellular system. The best
   extracts were Calophyllum brasiliense (hexane) and Clusia quadrangula
   (CH2CI2-MeOH) which inhibited HIV-1 RT (IC50=29.6mug/ml and 42mug/ml),
   and showed an EC50=92.5 mug/ml and 91 mug/ml, respectively, on MT2
   cells. However, only Calophyllum brasiliense hexane extract showed
   significant inhibition on viral replication (ED50=37.1 mug/ml), while
   Clusia quadrangula was less active (ED50= 124 mug/ml). These results
   support the idea that plant extracts represent a valuable source of

Abstract = {In this work, an analysis is done on the sudden injection of gaseous
   nitrogen in a porous cap filled initially with natural gas. A
   cylindrical geometry has been selected to derive the mathematical model.
   The resulting nondimensional governing equations for the pressure of the

   numerically using conventional finite difference techniques. The
   numerical results show that the injection process is sensibly controlled
   by several nondimensional parameters, which have a clear influence in

Abstract = {The concept of a minimal cell is discussed from the viewpoint of
   comparative genomics. Analysis of published DNA content values
   determined for 641 different archaeal and bacterial species by pulsed
   field gel electrophoresis has lead to a more precise definition of the
   genome size ranges of free-living and host-associated organisms. DNA
   content is not an indicator of phylogenetic position. However, the
   smallest genomes in our sample do not have a random distribution in
   rRNA-based evolutionary trees, and are found mostly in ( a) the basal
   branches of the tree where thermophiles are located; and (b) in late
   clades, such as those of Gram positive bacteria. While the
   smallest-known genome size for an endosymbiont is only 450 kb, no
   free-living prokaryote has been described to have genomes < 1450 kb.
   Estimates of the size of minimal gene complement can provide important
   insights in the primary biological functions required for a sustainable,
   reproducing cell nowadays and throughout evolutionary times, but
   definitions of the minimum cell is dependent on specific environments.},

   several prepositional phrases, and names of songs, books, movies, etc.).

Abstract = {In Nature it is possible to observe diverse rhythms. Because of their
   adaptive characteristics, the circadian rhythms are of major importance
   and have been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical
   studies. In this article, we give a presentation of the main results we
   have obtained about the motor circadian rhythm along some years of
   collaboration between biologists and mathematicians. We present a
   mathematical model simulating changes in frequency, synchronization and
   amplitude of the circadian oscillation during two developmental stages
   of the crayfish, namely, the juvenile and the adult stages. We report
   also some work in progress on the simulation of the phase response curve
   and on a simplified model of the rhythm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {An analysis is presented of the conjugate free convective heat transfer
   from a vertical, thermally thin fin heated from above to the surrounding
   fluid. An estimate is presented of the thermal penetration length over
   which the temperature of a very long fin would decrease from its maximum
   value at the top to the ambient temperature of the fluid. The solution
   of the problem is shown to depend on two nondimensional parameters: the
   Prandtl number of the fluid and the ratio s of the thermal penetration
   length to the actual length of the fin. The overall heat transfer rate
   for thermally short fins (large s) is practically independent of the fin
   material, whereas it depends on the thermal conductivity of the fin when
   s is small. Numerical and asymptotic results are given covering the
   whole range of s.},

Abstract = {A new epibiontic ciliate of the genus Metacystis is described on the

   under the scanning electron microscope. The cell body (10-35 X 10-18 mum
   in vivo) is transversely annulated (4-6 rings). The somatic ciliature
   consists of 22-30 longitudinal kineties, and patterned as 5-7 transverse
   kinetics. The circumoral kinety is composed of kinetosomes closely
   spaced. The macronucleus diameter measures about 3-7 mum. The lorica
   (18-61 X 11-26 mum) has the posterior end round to conical or irregular
   with mucoid filaments. This prostomatid colonizes both natural and
   artificial substrates placed in an aquarium. Metacystis borrori n. sp.
   is a species that forms part of the ciliate community on Thalassia
   testudinum with a temperature range of 21-26 degreesC and a salinity of

Abstract = {The stability of the DNA duplex depends on its sequence rather than on
   its composition (the relative proportions of the four nucleotides or
   bases A, C, G and T). This fact was recognized since the eighties by
   several authors. They calculated the duplex relative stability and
   temperature-dependent behavior (DeltaG, DeltaH) for the ten different
   pairwise interactions. Even accepting that the experimental conditions
   and theoretical assumptions in these reports differ, one should expect
   little disagreement if their results were to reflect the same natural
   phenomenon. Unfortunately, this is not the case: The discrepancies among
   different teams are beyond acceptable experimental errors.
   Thermodynamics allows to relate DNA dimer frequencies with in vivo DNA
   interactions. In this paper we follow this approach and settle out the
   controversy by finding the parameter set consistent with intra-cellular
   DNA local free energy distribution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   are gravity, friction, a stochastic force that simulates microscopic
   interactions and buoyancy. The Reynolds numbers are small enough to
   assure unseparated and symmetrical flow around the sphere. The numerical
   analysis is carried out by solving the equation of motion using the
   Verlet algorithm, resides the numerical results, the program includes an
   interactive animation of the physical phenomenon. Although originally
   conceived for teaching, the program may be used in research to

Abstract = {Let G be a locally compact Hausdorff group. It is proved that: (1) on
   each Palais proper G-space X there exists a compatible family of
   Ginvariant pseudometrics; (2) the existence of a compatible G-invariant
   metric on a metrizable proper G-space X is equivalent to the
   paracompactness of the orbit space X/G; (3) if in addition G is either
   almost connected or separable, and X is locally separable, then there
   exists a compatible G-invariant metric on X.},

Abstract = {We formulate a non-linear system of differential equations that models
   the dynamics of dengue fever. This disease is produced by any of the
   four serotypes of dengue arbovirus. Each serotype produces permanent
   immunity to it, but only a certain degree of cross-immunity to
   heterologous serotypes. In our model we consider the relation between
   two serotypes. Our interest is to analyze the factors that allow the
   invasion and persistence of different serotypes in the human population.
   Analysis of the model reveals the existence of four equilibrium points,
   which belong to the region of biological interest. One of the
   equilibrium points corresponds to the disease-free state, the other
   three equilibria correspond to the two states where just one serotype is
   present, and the state where both serotypes coexist, respectively. We
   discuss conditions for the asymptotic stability of equilibria, supported
   by analytical and numerical methods. We find that coexistence of both
   serotypes is possible for a large range of parameters.},

Abstract = {We present a brief history of the scientific study of butterflies in
   Mexico, which began in the 18th century, and provide an overview of the
   holdings of Mexican butterfly specimens in institutional collections
   worldwide. The current status of a massive database on Mexican
   butterflies. at present containing over 450,000 distributional records,
   is detailed. Around 1800 species of butterflies have been reported from
   Mexico, which equals roughly 10\% of the world butterfly fauna, placing
   Mexico among the ten most butterfly-rich countries in the world. About
   14.8\% of Mexico's butterfly species are endemic, and six genera appear
   to be endemic to Mexico. For the first time, we present a list of all
   endemic Mexican butterfly taxa: 88 species and 150 additional subspecies
   of Papilionoidea, and 171 species and 14 additional subspecies of
   Hesperiidae. Patterns of species richness and endemism are not alike:
   the richest areas are in the southeastern part of Mexico, mostly in the
   tropical evergreen forests, whereas endeniism is greater in the and
   north, and the humid montane forest in the central and southern parts of
   the country. The twenty richest sites for butterfly diversity in Mexico
   are identified, and comparisons are made between these sites and
   regions.},

Abstract = {Sceloporus bicanthalis is a viviparons lizard that inhabits high
   altitude temperate zone habitats in Mexico. Our histological
   observations indicate that adult males exhibit spermatogenesis and
   spermiogenesis throughout the year; no seasonal differences were found
   in testes mass, height of epididymal epithelial cells, and number of
   layers of spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, and
   spermatids. Seminiferous tubules exhibited slight, but statistically
   significant, seasonal variation in diameter. Continuous spermatogenesis
   and spermiogenesis of S. bicanthalis differ from the cyclical pattern
   exhibited by most species of lizards and from lizard species sympatric
   with S. bicanthalis. Continuous reproductive activity of males of S.
   bicanthalis, and maturation at a relatively small size, is associated
   with a female reproductive activity in which vitellogenic or pregnant
   females are present in the population during all months of the year. As
   a consequence, males can encounter potential mates as soon as they
   mature.},

Abstract = {Here we present a simple and easily handled algorithm for the group
   theoretical classification of quantum states that although, it is
   implicit in a general group theory formulation, it is not presented the
   way it is discussed here, and which facilitates its application by
   non-specialists. It consists in finding the minimal set; of symmetry
   operations needed to identify unequivocally the symmetry for each state
   and a direct calculation of the character of the representation expanded
   by the vector state. The algorithm allows simple and fast calculations
   of the symmetry properties, even for large symmetry groups and systems
   with many degrees of freedom. In particular the occurrence of accidental
   degeneracy is distinguished clearly using this method. In order to
   illustrate the application of the method, we discuss the classification
   of the vibrational states for two different molecular systems. (C) 2002

Abstract = {The Upper Lerma is a high altitude basin with three water bodies linked
   by the Lerma River. This basin has a long archaeological history,
   characterised by the establishment of settlements within the lacustrine
   ecosystem itself (man-made islands) during the late Classic to
   Epiclassic (AD 550-900), which were abandoned by the end of the
   Epiclassic. The Upper Lerma is an ideal site to study climatic and
   environmental conditions during the period of human occupation, as well
   as during the last full-glacial/interglacial cycle. Two sediment cores
   (STCRZ: 9.54 in and Almoloya del Rio: 5.12 in) were recovered from the
   highest lake in the system (Chignahuapan). Ten radiocarbon dates provide
   chronologies for these sequences in which the Tres Cruces Tephra (c.
   8500 yr BP) and the Upper Toluca Pumice (c. 11600 yr BP) serve as
   stratigraphic markers. Magnetic properties, loss on ignition, and diatom
   analyses were used to infer lake level fluctuations during the last c.
   22000 yr 13P. The Late Pleistocene environment was characterised by a
   freshwater lake. High sediment input and variable lake levels are
   recorded during the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 19 000-16 000 yr BP), while
   slightly higher water levels and reduced sediment input are recorded
   during the Late Glacial (c. 16 000-11 000 yr BP). A short episode of
   shallow conditions is inferred by c. 12 400 yr BP. Holocene lake levels
   were generally shallower, and three episodes of very shallow, slightly
   alkaline waters are identified. The first dates to the early Holocene
   (c. 11 000-7000 yr BP). The second is centred at c. 4600/4500 yr BP. The
   third occurred between c. 2000 (?) and 800 yr BP (c. 200 BC-AD 1100,
   calibrated ages) with very shallow water after c. 1400 yr BP (AD 550,
   calibrated age). Lake level increased after c. 800 yr BP. These three
   shallow water events are also recorded at other sites in Central Mexico
   indicating regional climatic trends rather than local events. A deeper
   water phase occurred between 7000 and 6400/6200 yr BP. The last shallow
   water phase correlates with the Classic and Epiclassic periods (AD
   200-900), and shallowest conditions occurred in the late Classic to
   Epiclassic (c. AD 550-900), when the construction of man-made islands
   reached a peak. An increase in lake level after c. 800 yr BP (AD 1100
   calibrated age) may have led to the abandonment of this life strategy.

Abstract = {In this paper, the effects produced by iron substitutions in the

   properties are studied. The Rietveld-fit of the crystal structure and
   Mossbauer spectroscopy results of (Y0.9Ca0.1)Ba2Cu4-xFexO8 samples
   indicate that the iron atoms occupy the Cu(1) sites of the (Cu-O)(2)
   double chains in fivefold coordination at low iron concentrations.
   Besides at high iron concentrations the iron atoms occupy the Cu(I)
   sites of single Cu-O chains and Cu(2) sites in the CuO2 planes of the
   (Y0.9Ca0.1)Ba2Cu4O8 phase with structural defects. Simultaneously, as
   iron concentration increases, a faster decrease of T-c is observed in
   this material compared with the YBa2Cu3-xFexO7-delta system. According
   to the charge-transfer model proposed for YBa2Cu4O8 under pressure, the
   decrease in the Cu(1)-O(4) bond length in parallel to the increase in
   the Cu(2)-O(4) bond length may affect the charge-transfer mechanism
   leading to the suppression of T-c.},

Abstract = {The assessment of antiavian antibodies is relevant for the study of
   pigeon breeder's disease; nevertheless, different factors may hamper
   their accurate detection. The objective of this study was to determine
   whether an endogenous interfering effect in pigeon breeder's disease
   might explain the simultaneous presence of IgM, IgG, and IgA antiavian
   antibodies in high titers as assessed by ELISA. Fifty-nine patients with
   pigeon breeder's disease, 80 healthy controls, and 47 asymptomatic
   breeders were studied. To assess possible interfering effects by
   endogenous immunoglobulins, serum IgG was separated through protein
   A-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. Antiavian antibodies were measured in
   whole and separated samples by ELISA. Since a decline of IgM antiavian
   antibodies following IgG removal was consistent with a false-positive
   effect, the causes were studied. High values of IgM, IgG, and IgA
   antiavian antibodies were found in 17.4\% of patients with pigeon
   breeder's disease. An IgM rheumatoid factor activity against IgG was
   found through ELISA in sera with false-positive IgM antiavian
   antibodies. Rheumatoid factor binding was confirmed by Western blot.
   Experimental addition of purified rheumatoid factor to sera with IgG
   antiavian antibodies replicated the interfering effect. A control group
   of rheumatoid arthritis with high rheumatoid factor values did not show
   positive antiavian antibodies tests. No IgG with anti-IgM or anti-IgA
   activity was found, and the detection of IgA against IgM and IgG was
   negative. In conclusion, the study of antiavian antibodies might be
   affected by different immunoassay conditions. An endogenous rheumatoid
   factor activity produced false-positive IgM results. Other similar
   interferences warrant a careful evaluation during the serological
   assessment of pigeon breeder's disease.},

Title = {Somatic meiosis and development of the juvenile gametophyte in members

Journal = {PHYCOLOGIA},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Seven populations (six in culture and one sampled directly from nature)
   of the freshwater red algal families Batrachospermaceae, Lemaneaceae and
   Thoreaceae were examined, involving three species of Batrachospermum,
   two of Paralemanea and one of Thorea. All `Chantransia' stages
   ultimately produced juvenile gametophytes. The production of juvenile
   gametophytes in the three populations of Batrachospermum was generally
   most abundant at 15 degrees C and low irradiances (47-68 mumol photons
   m(-2) s(-1)). The most abundant gametophyte development in the
   Paralemanea species was observed at 10 degrees C and low or high
   irradiances (47-142 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Gametophyte production
   in Thoreaceae occurred at higher temperatures (20 degrees C) and also at
   low irradiances. In species of the Batrachospermaceae and Lemaneaceae,
   the `elimination cells' can be situated on the basal or suprabasal cell
   of the juvenile gametophyte, but the position is usually fixed in
   individual species. The presence and position of the elimination cells
   remain to be established in Thoreaceae. Our results corroborate a
   previous study suggesting that the position of elimination cells is such
   a constant feature that it is of potential diagnostic value at the
   generic or infrageneric (sectional or specific) level. The
   characteristics observed in the development of the juvenile gametophytes
   in species of Batrachospermaceae and Lemaneaceae essentially agreed with
   general descriptions in the previous studies. The characteristics of the
   Thoreaceae, with a distinctive developmental pattern of the juvenile
   gametophyte and the occurrence of two morphological types in the
   `Chantransia' stage, support the proposal to elevate it to the ordinal
   level. Two remark-able observations in Batrachospermum species were the
   production of numerous juvenile gametophytes; from filaments of the same
   plant of the `Chantransia' stage and the formation of a system of
   rhizoidal filaments or cell agglomeration of the juvenile gametophytes,
   which produced new gametophytes. These two characteristics potentially
   increase the formation of additional gametophytes under favourable
   conditions.},

Abstract = {We reviewed morphological variation, taxonomic status, geographic
   distribution, ecology, and behavior of the poorly known hummingbird, the
   Mexican Sheartail (Doricha eliza), based on museum specimens and field
   studies. Although the broadly disjunct distribution of the species would
   suggest that two taxa are involved, morphological differences between
   the populations appear minor, not deserving of formal taxonomic
   recognition. Ecological differences between the two populations are
   stronger, however; modeled ecological niches are nearly nonoverlapping,
   and ontogenetic and behavioral differences may exist. We recommend that,
   given its extremely restricted distribution, the Veracruz population be
   considered critically endangered, whereas the Yucatan population be
   designated as having a restricted range and accorded near-threatened
   status.},

Abstract = {Let (B, parallel to . parallel to) be a real separable Banach space of
   dimension 1 less than or equal to d less than or equal to infinity, and
   assume X,X-1, X-2,... are i.i.d. B valued random vectors with law
   mu=L(X) and mean m=integral(B) xdmu(x). Nummelin's conditional weak law
   of large numbers establishes that under suitable conditions on (D subset
   of B, mu) and for every epsilon > 0, lim(n) P(parallel
   toS(n)/n-a(0)parallel to < ε\textbackslash{}S-n/n ∈ D)=1, with a(0) the
   dominating point of D and S-n = Σ(n)(j=1) X-j. We study the rates of
   convergence of such laws, i.e., we examine lim(n) P(parallel toS(n)/n -
   a(0)parallel to < t/n(r)/S-n/n ∈ D) as d, r, t and D vary. It turns out
   that the limit is sensitive to variations in these parameters.
   Additionally, we supply another proof of Nummelin's law of large
   numbers. Our results are most complete when 1 ≤ d < infinity, but we
   also include results when d=infinity, mainly in Hilbert space. A
   connection to the Gibbs conditioning principle is also examined. (C)

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-141},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the normal teaching of thermodynamics as well as in the traditional
   textbooks, the second axiom is postulated in terms of thermal
   refrigerators and motors according to the Clausius and Kelvin-Planck's
   formulations, leaving open the possibility for generalizing the
   statement of the second axiom by means of motors and ``refrigerators{''}
   associated to other intensive variables than temperature. In particular
   it is possible to employ pressure motors and vacuum pumps in the
   formulation of a corresponding second axiom, such that the maximum work
   is dependent on the pressure differences between two fixed ``pressure
   reservoires{''}. It is hoped that the teaching of this generalization of
   the second axiom leads the student to the understanding of two facts:
   first, that his perception of the fundamentals of thermodynamics is more
   profound, and second, that these fundamentals are not unalterable so
   that he could be responsible for its change. It might then be so that
   his learning of thermodynamics is more meaningful.},

Journal = {BOTANICA MARINA},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {45},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Caulerpa, a coenocytic marine macroalgae, is a genus characterized by
   having a prostrate indeterminate axis (stolon) with rhizoids and
   vertical axes that are potentially independent units as Caulerpa can
   withstand fragmentation and regenerate after a lamina or stolon are cut.
   This is similar to clonal growth described for vascular plants. A
   morphometric study was conducted comparing two morphologically distinct
   populations of Caulerpa prolifera growing in contrasting light
   environments of a coral reef lagoon. Morphometric measurements and dry
   weight partitioning were analyzed. Results of this study show that
   significant morphological differences exist. In a shaded environment C
   prolifera had a higher dry weight (mg/cm(2)) than in sunny areas,
   distance between ramets was longer in shade areas, resulting in an open
   growth similar to the `Guerrilla' growth form compared to the `Phalanx'
   growth form of sunny sites. In shaded areas the population had fewer
   lamina per ramet and longer stipes. Morphological differences were
   analyzed in relation to light intensity. Compact growth, highly branched
   and thick, small laminas are morphological traits associated with plants
   in bright habitats. In contrast, thin and longer laminas are more
   efficient in the capture of light and typify shaded populations.
   Differences were found at all three levels: clonal fragment, ramets and
   modules. This suggests that C prolifera has a clonal plant morphology
   and behavior.},

Abstract = {Among the plants collected from the Pie de Vaca Formation of the
   Oligocene, of Tepexi de Rodriguez, Puebla, Mexico are five plants of
   Anacardiaceae, Haplorhus medranoensis, Rhus toxicodendron, Rhus sp.,
   Comocladia intermedia, and Pistacia marquezu represented by their leaves
   and/or leaflets. The past and present diversity and geographic
   distribution of one of these genera, Rhus, demonstrate its capability to
   adapt and diversify in a wide variety of environments. Leaf architecture
   characters of this taxon overlap with those of other genera in the
   family, suggesting a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. The presence
   in the Pie de Vaca Formation of a type of Pistacia with leaf
   architecture characters similar to those of Asian plants further
   supports a long history of exchange between low-latitude North America
   and Asia. Links between low-latitude North and South America and the
   Caribbean are suggested by the presence of Comocladia and Haplorhus.
   Whereas Comocladia highlights the long history of regional endemics in
   the area, Haplorhus, today an endemic monotypic genus of Peru, suggests
   exchange mechanisms between North and South America. The morphologic
   characters of these taxa, and those of Pseudosmodingium (Anacardiaceae),
   some Rosaceae, Leguminosae, and Berberidaceae, suggest that the Pie de
   Vaca community was established and evolved in harsh environmental
   conditions. The Pie de Vaca flora thus provides significant new insights
   into the biogeographic relationships of the low latitude vegetation of
   North America.},

   metrizable proper G-spaces admitting an invariant metric and having

   for performing correct measurements of relative thermoluminescent (TL)
   efficiencies, an investigation has been carried out to quantify the
   effect of using different experimental procedures in the evaluation of 3
   MeV proton-to-gamma relative efficiency (eta(p,gamma)) of LiF:Mg,Ti.
   Variations in batch, presentation, annealing and reader have been
   studied. When the same protocol is used to measure proton and gamma TL
   response, efficiency values obtained range from 0.36 to 0.59 for peak 5
   and from 0.44 to 0.79 for the total signal. The use of different
   annealings and different batches leads to 20\% and 10\% differences in
   eta(p,gamma), respectively. Large differences (40\%) are found between
   efficiency values measured with TLD-100 chips and those obtained using
   TLD-100 microcubes. When `mixed' procedures are used to measure the
   proton and the gamma response, differences in eta(p,gamma), may increase
   even more. The main conclusion of this work is to stress the importance
   of measuring an entire series of experiments in the same laboratory with
   a carefully defined protocol and using dosemeters from the same batch to
   obtain heavy charged particle TL response and gamma TL response with
   identical annealing and readout procedures.},

Abstract = {Three collections of Paralcmanea from Central Mexico included two
   species. Paralemanea mexicana is large (length greater than or equal to
   4.0 cm; diameter > 400 pm) and generally branched (greater than or equal
   to 40\% of plants branched), with whorled branches, of first to second
   order. Paralemanea annulata is small (length < 5.0 cm; diameter < 500
   pm), generally unbranched (less than or equal to5\% of plants branched),
   with branches of first order. Spermatangial sori contained obovoid
   spermatangia, formed from cells of the outer cortical layers, extending
   above the thallus surface. Carpogonial branches are described for the
   first time in P. mexicana. They develop on lateral filaments at nodes or
   internodes and have ovoid to globular cells, abundantly branched at the
   basal portion, penetrating the cortex towards the thallus surface.
   Carposporophytes are sessile on the inner portion of the cortex and
   produce carpospores in chains of up to twelve, The `Chantransia' stage
   was observed in R. mexicana. Paralemanea annulata is described for the
   first time from Mexico and P. mexicana is endemic from this country.
   Both species were collected in cold (temperature 12-16degreesC), acidic
   (pH 5.5-6.0), shallow (depth 1-60 cm) and moderate to fast flowing
   waters (> 35 cm s(-1)), in shaded or partly shaded river segments, on
   rocky substrata (mostly bedrock).},

Abstract = {We discuss the relationship between p-boundedness and
   quasi-p-boundedness in the realm of GLOTS for p is an element of
   omega{*}. We show that p-pseudocompactness, p-compactness,
   quasi-p-pseudocompactness and quasi-p-compactness are equivalent
   properties for a GLOTS; that bounded subsets of a GLOTS are
   strongly-bounded; and C-compact subsets of a GLOTS are
   strongly-C-compact. We also show that a topologically orderable group is
   locally precompact if and only if it is metrizable. For bounded subsets
   of a GLOTS, a version of the classical Gilcksberg's Theorem on
   pseudocompactness is obtained: if A(alpha) is a bounded subset of a
   GLOTS X-alpha for each alpha is an element of Delta, then
   cl(beta(Pialphais an element ofDelta) X-alpha) (Pi(alphais an element
   ofDelta) A(alpha)) = Pi(alphais an element ofDelta)
   cl(beta(Xalpha))A(alpha). Also we prove that there exists an
   ultrapseudocompact topological group which is not quasi-p-compact for
   any p is an element of omega{*}. To see this example,
   p-pseudocompactness and p-compactness are investigated in the field of
   C-pi-spaces, proving that ultracompactness, quasi-p-compactness for a p
   is an element of omega{*} and countable compactness (respectively,
   ultrapseudocompactness, quasi-p-pseudocompactness for a p is an element
   of omega{*} and pseudocompactness) are equivalent properties in the
   class of spaces of the form C-pi(X, {[}0, 1]).},

Abstract = {The taxonomic identification of diatom species that constituted
   phytoplankton communities in remote times is determined in several
   research fields like ecology, evolution, paleoecology and
   biostratigraphy. In the last 30 years the use of fossil diatoms like
   environmental indicators has become of prime importance. However the use
   of these organisms is limited since they are found in sediment samples
   mostly fragmented or pulverized. This may lead to confusion and loss of
   information. In this work we used invariant correlation to identify 21
   species of fossil diatoms. This correlation method is invariant to
   position, scale and rotation of the image With this method we were able
   to identify the diatomspecies from only a small fragment of the
   organisms. Results showed that it is possible to identify some species
   having a range since 2.12\% of information of the image. For example the
   minimum percentage was for Azpeitia nodulifer Var A. This methodology
   can be used for the development of an automated system of plankton
   identification. An automatized identification of diatoms would be able
   to guarantee a faster identification and also would reduce the time
   necessary for acomplishing analysis of samples highly fragmented.},

Abstract = {The goal of the present study was to know the distribution and
   prevalence of ciliated Protozoa attached to the exoskeleton and gills of
   the crayfish, Cambarellus patzcuarensis. Samples of crayfish were taken
   at two sites in Patzcuaro Lake, Michoacan, Mexico. Fifteen species of
   ciliated Protozoa (peritrichs) were found attached as epibionts on the
   crayfish. Their distribution and prevalence on 14 body parts of the
   basibiont is presented. Community structures were analysed using
   Jaccard's index and principal component analysis. The results showed
   that the gills had no similarity with respect to the other body parts as
   regards peritrich attachment. The pereiopods and the uropods were the
   body parts with the highest species richness, the gills had the lowest.
   Cothurnia variabilis is the only species with a high degree of
   specificity to the body region to which it is attached (gills). Of the
   15 species found, only one has been reported exclusively as an epibiont
   on crustaceans.},

Abstract = {Ancient DNA from the bone remains of 25 out of 28 pre-Columbian
   individuals from the Late Classic-Postelassic Maya site of Xcaret,
   Quintana Roo, was recovered, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was amplified
   by using the polymerase chain reaction. The presence of the four
   founding Amerindian mtDNA lineages was investigated by restriction
   analysis and by direct sequencing in selected individuals. The mtDNA
   lineages A, B, and C were found in this population. Eighty-four percent
   of the individuals were lineage A, whereas lineages B and C were present
   at low frequencies, 4\% and 8\%, respectively. Lineage D was absent from
   our sample. One individual did not possess any of the four lineages. Six
   skeletons out of 7 dated from the Late Classic period were haplotype A,
   whereas 11 skeletons out of 16 dated from the Postclassic period were
   also haplotype A.
   The distribution of mtDNA lineages in the Xcaret population contrasts
   sharply with that found in ancient Maya from Copan, which lack lineages
   A and B. On the other hand, our results resemble more closely the
   frequencies of mtDNA lineages found in contemporary Maya from the
   Yucatan Peninsula and in other Native American contemporary populations
   of Mesoamerican origin. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The thermoluminescent (TL) response, supralinearity function, and
   relative efficiency with respect to Co-60 gamma -rays, of TLD-100
   exposed to 0.7. 1.5 and 3 MeV protons have been measured. The TL
   response of the glow curve peaks using two different deconvolutions,
   separating in either 7 (3-9) or 9 peaks (3-10 and peaks 6a and 6b). was
   investigated. Results for the supralinearity function of peaks 5 and 7-9
   and the relative response of peaks 5 and 7 are insensitive to the chosen
   deconvolution scheme. At all energies we observe that peak 5 is slightly
   supralinear and that supralinearity increases as a function of the peak
   temperature. The relative efficiencies, measured for the total TL signal
   (area under the glow curve) and peaks 5 and 7, decrease with the proton
   energy having values of 0.33, 0.46 and 0.70 (total TL signal), 0.22,
   0.32 and 0.53 (peak 5) and 1.4, 2.6 and 3.6 (peak 7) at 0.7. 1.5 and 3
   MeV, respectively. These data agree with the systematics reported in the
   literature. The measurements of the supralinearity function are compared
   with Monte Carlo track interaction model calculations. The analysis
   suggests that the model ion track effective radius and the saturation
   radius are independent of the incident ion energy. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {We have surveyed the inner 5' of the Orion Nebula by means of Ha and
   {[}N II] Fabry-Perot imaging spectroscopy to present a kinematical study
   of the Herbig-Haro objects in the nebula. The objects studied in this
   work are HH 202, 203, 204, 529, 269, and other associated features. For
   HH 202 we find new features that, because of their high velocities (up
   to 100 km s(-1)), indicate the presence of an outflow that probably is
   an HH flow not cataloged previously. HH 202 could be only a part of this
   larger outflow. Large internal motions are found in the fainter regions
   of HH 203-204, as well as evidence of transverse density gradients that
   could account for the asymmetry in the brightness distribution of HH
   204. We report for the first time a high blueshifted velocity (-118 km
   s(-1)) associated with HH 204 and show that the apex of HH 204 is indeed
   the zone of maximum velocity, in agreement with bow shock models. We
   also studied the radial velocity field of HH 269, finding features
   associated with the HH object. From our studies, we find kinematic
   evidence that suggests HH 203-204 and HH 202 are part of a big (similar
   to0.55 pc) bipolar HH outflow.},

Abstract = {The genus Heterolinus Sharp, 1885 is revised, with generic
   redescription, description of a new species, a key to the species,
   remarks, illustrations, and a distributional map. Heterolinus distinctus
   Bernhauer, 1905 is a junior synonym of H. xanthogaster (Solsky 1875) new
   combination. Lectotypes are designated for Xantholinus puncticeps
   Guerin-Meneville, 1844 and Xantholinus xanthogaster Solsky, 1875.
   Heterolinus puncticeps is distributed in Colombia and Ecuador, H.
   xanthogaster in Peru and Bolivia, and H. basiniger new species in Costa
   Rica, Colombia and Ecuador. According to a cladistic analysis based on
   47 transformation series from external morphology and male genitalia,
   Heterolinus is a monophyletic group, and is the sister group of
   Ehomalolinus plus Homalolinus. Heterolinus puncticeps is the sister
   species of H. xanthogaster and H. basiniger is the most plesiomorphic
   species of the genus.},

Abstract = {Eighteen collections of red-coloured Audouinella from Central Mexico and
   southeastern Brazil detected three species. The most common species, A.
   eugenea, is characterized by macroscopic thalli, the erect system
   consisting of filaments with cylindrical cells, undifferentiated into
   proximal and distal parts, and relatively large monosporangia (greater
   than or equal to 12.0 mum long). Spermatangia. and possible propagules
   were observed in some Mexican populations. This is the third Audouinella
   species observed to have gametangia and the first member of the
   Acrochaetiales with putative propagules. The second species, from
   Central Mexico, was characterized by the following features: macroscopic
   thalli, the erect system differentiated into proximal parts with
   cylindrical cells, unbranched or rarely branched, and distal parts with
   barrel-shaped cells, abundantly branched to form dense fascicles, with
   alternate or dichotomous branching, some at right-angles to the axis,
   and relatively large monosporangia (greater than or equal to 12.0 mum
   long). The morphologically distinct proximal and distal portions of the
   erect system, the latter forming dense fascicles, was a consistent
   character so far unknown in Audouinella; thus, we propose a new species,
   A. huastecana sp. nov. The third species is a microscopic epiphyte, A.
   meiospora, with a well-developed prostrate system composed of creeping
   and loosely aggregated filaments, and a short homogeneous erect system
   (less than or equal to 15 cells) of filaments with cylindrical or
   barrel-shaped cells and small monosporangia (less than or equal to 13.0
   mum long). A. eugenea and A. meiospora are characterized for the first
   time from the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, respectively, both
   occurring mostly in areas of tropical or subtropical rainforests. A.
   meiospora is reported from new macroalgal hosts. A. eugenea and A.
   huastecana tended to occur in warm, alkaline waters with a high ion
   content that were moderate to fast flowing, whereas A. meiospora was not
   associated with particular habitats.},

Abstract = {Acute ethanol administration partially inhibits DNA and protein
   syntheses during liver regeneration (LR) induced by partial hepatectomy
   (PH) in rats. Previous findings that the magnitude of ethanol's
   deleterious effects on LR are related to the route and timing of its
   administration led us to perform studies at the ultrastructural level,
   comparing ethanol effects on PH-induced LR, as a consequence of its
   administration route. PH promoted alterations on the endoplasmic
   reticulum and mitochondria, accompanied by decreased glycogen and
   increased lipid content in cytoplasm. Structural nuclear and nucleolar
   activities were also evident. Intragastric ethanol administration
   practically abolished the adaptative changes found in PH-promoted
   regenerating hepatocytes, whereas its administration through the
   intraperitoneal route induced later ultrastructural modifications,
   indicating cellular proliferation. These results suggest that ethanol,
   under certain conditions, could stimulate liver proliferation triggered
   by PH. The mechanism underlying this surprising effect of ethanol on LR
   remains to be elucidated, However, it is suggested that an altered
   ethanol metabolism by rats subjected to PH could be involved.},

Title = {Visualization of the transport of primary and secondary bile acids

Abstract = {Background/Aims: Lysyl fluorescein conjugated bile acid analogues
   (LFCBAA) closely parallel their natural counter-parts. To assess LFCBAA
   as a tool for the visualization of bile acid transport within liver
   tissue.
   Methods: Wistar rats were administered physiological concentrations of
   the primary bile acid analogue cholyllysl fluoroscein (CLF) and of the
   secondary bile acid analogue lithocholyllysyl fluorescein (LLF) and
   serial liver biopsies were taken at fixed intervals. Both compounds were
   also injected retrogradely into the biliary tree. Frozen sections were
   examined by fluorescence microscopy.
   Results: Both CLF and LLF were rapidly taken up from sinusoidal blood
   but differed significantly in their hepatic handling. CLF was rapidly
   transported into bile, whereas LLF transport was slower and produced
   significantly more bile duct fluorescence. LLF clearance showed a
   lobular gradient with last remaining bile acid being confined largely to
   zone 3. Both compounds were avidly taken up by cholangiocytes after
   injection intravenously or retrogradely into the biliary tree.
   Conclusions: Visualization of LFCBAA by fluorescence microscopy may
   yield further information regarding hepatobiliary bile acid localization
   during studies of physiological and pathological mechanisms involved in
   transport of bile acids. The presence of both compounds within
   cholangiocytes strongly suggests that they may undergo a degree of
   chole-hepatic recirculation.

Abstract = {Absolute differential and total cross sections for single electron loss
   were measured for Ar+ ions on various atoms in the energy range of 1.5
   to 5.0 keV. The laboratory angular scan for the distributions ranged
   from -2.5 to 2.5 degrees. The measured differential cross sections have
   been integrated over the experimental angular range providing absolute
   total cross sections. The behavior of the total electron loss cross
   sections with the target atomic number, Z(t), shows different
   dependences as the collision energy increases. In all cases it displays
   a saturation as Zt increases.},

Abstract = {The taxonomic identification of diatom species that constituted
   phytoplankton communities in remote times is determining in several
   research fields like ecology, evolution, paleoecology and
   biostratigraphy, In the last 30 years the use of fossil diatoms like
   environmental indicators has, become of prime importance. However the
   use of these organisms is limited since they are found in sediment
   samples mostly fragmented or pulverized. Tins may lead to confusion and
   loss of information. In this work we used invariant correlation to
   identify 12 species of fossil diatoms. With this method we were able to
   identify the diatom species from only a smalt fragment of the organisms.
   This methodology can be used for the development of an automated system
   of plankton identification. An automatized identification of diatoms
   would be able to guarantee a faster identification and also would reduce
   the time necessary for acomplishing analysis of samples highly
   fragmented.},

Abstract = {We examined variation among populations of the complex assemblage of

   (Elliott, 1871), of Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. A previous author had
   correctly suggested recognition of most Oaxaca populations as a full
   species, A. wagneri Phillips, 1964. We found that the Chiapas
   populations are also recognizable as a distinct taxon; because no name
   had previously been applied to these populations, we name it as a new
   subspecies, A. viridifrons villadai. Populations recently described as
   A. viridifrons rowlei are actually referable to A. wagneri; moreover,
   that subspecies is not valid as an entity distinct from the remainder of
   A.wagneri.},

Abstract = {The antiferromagnetic state of the undoped CaCuO(2) superconductor
   cannot be easily obtained by a first principles calculation. In this
   article a simple model is presented to approximately calculate this
   state using linearized augmented plane wave based on density functional
   theory. By studying the density of states it is shown that the
   antiferromagnetism is originated exclusively in the Cu:d orbitals and
   that the major effect is around the Fermi energy. This model is later
   applied to (Y(x)Ca(1-x))CuO(2) and (Nd(x)Ca(1-x))CuO(2). For the yttrium
   compound at ``low{''} doping (25\%) antiferromagnetism diminishes but is
   not destroyed, but at higher doping (50\%) it is destroyed. For the
   neodymium compound the main feature at the Fermi energy is the Nd:4f,
   which is so strong that destroys the antiferromagnetism of copper atoms.

Abstract = {The steady state heat transfer characteristics of a thin vertical strip
   with internal heat generation is studied in this work. The
   nondimensional temperature distribution in the strip is obtained as a
   function of the following parameters: (a) the intensity and distribution
   of the internal heat sources, (b) the aspect ratio of the strip, (c) the
   longitudinal heat conductance of the strip and (d) the Prandtl number of
   the fluid. Both the thermally thin and the thick wall approximations are
   considered in this paper. The total thermal energy or averaged
   temperature of the strip is found to decrease as the influence of the
   longitudinal heat conduction effects in the strip decreases in the
   thermally thin wall regime. After reaching a minimum, it increases again
   in the thermally thick wall regime. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {Brachypelma, a genus of nine endangered tarantula species in Mexico, is
   the only group of spiders included in Appendix II of CITES, owing to
   habitat degradation and illegal trafficking. However, while the majority
   of the nine species of Brachypelma are thought to be threatened, little
   is known of their ecology and distribution. Brachypelma klaasi is the
   rarest species, occurring in a few isolated populations on the Pacific
   coast of Mexico. We present an analysis of population distribution and
   micro-habitat requirements of B. klaasi over different spatial scales
   within the biological reserve at Chamela, Jalisco as part of a wider
   ecological study of the endangered Brachypelma group. Burrows and
   dispersing spiders were confined to a southern area of the reserve
   covering approximately 0.5 km(2). Within this area, burrows were not
   aggregated at lower spatial scales (2(4)-2(16) m(2)), unlike other
   related species. Also, there was no evidence that intra-specific
   interactions (either positive or negative interactions) influenced the
   distribution of burrows. Distribution of burrows at low spatial scales
   was related to low afternoon temperatures and high humidity in
   mid-summer. These abiotic factors may influence the survival and
   development of eggs and spiderlings, and appear to be more important in
   governing the distribution of B. klaasi than are food resources or
   intra-specific interactions. We discuss how these findings may
   facilitate the re-introduction of captive-bred individuals of B. klaasi
   and other Brachypelma species.},

   among the physiological rates (VO2 and OEE', body weight and
   temperature, were fitted by second order polynomial models; the response
   surfaces generated allowed the evaluation of stress induced by the
   interaction of those variables. Both VO2 and OEE' invariably increased
   as temperature increased. In small animals kept in 0.5 mg Cd L-1, the
   VO2 increase was compensated by a proportional increase in OEE', whereas
   in larger fishes (> 1 g) no compensatory response was observed. Both
   small and large fishes were unable to compensate for a higher VO2 when
   exposed to higher cadmium concentration. It is concluded that OEE' in
   young fish is an early response of stress due to sublethal cadmium

Abstract = {The impermeability of the Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth (Convolvulaceae)
   seed coat may change if the seeds are exposed to different temperatures
   during the six months of the dry season, i.e. from dispersal to the
   beginning of the rainy season. The effects on seed coat dormancy of
   three constant storage temperatures (15 degreesC, 25 degreesC and 35
   degreesC), over a six month period were evaluated. 96\% of the
   impermeable newly collected seeds were not affected by storage at 15
   degreesC: 97\% of these remained hard and only 3\% germinated; while
   seeds stored at 25 degreesC and 35 degreesC had broken seed coat
   dormancy in nonscarified seeds, increasing germination up to 80\% and
   95\%, respectively. Results show that: a) under the three thermal
   conditions, seeds maintained their viability during six months, b) seed
   coat impermeability was preserved at low storage temperature with the
   potential formation of a seed bank, and c) seed coat dormancy was broken
   by the high storage temperatures of 25 degreesC and 35 degreesC, and the
   resulting permeable seeds could germinate in the favorable conditions of
   the rainy season.},

Abstract = {Let X be the Hamiltonian vector field with two degrees of freedom
   associated to the cubic polynomial Hamiltonian H(x,y,z,w). Using the
   Poincare compactification we show that all the energy levels of X in R-4
   reach the infinity in a surface topologically equivalent to the
   intersection of the 3-dimensional sphere S-3 = \{(x, y, z, w) is an
   element of R-4 : x(2) + y(2) + z(2) +w(2) = 1\} with \{(x, y, z, w) is
   an element of R-4 : H-3(x, y, z, w) = 0\}, where H-3 denotes the
   homogeneous part of degree 3 of H. Such a surface is called the Infinity
   Manifold associated to H. In this paper we describe all possible
   infinity manifolds of cubic polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields with 2
   degrees of freedom. Our method is general, but since actual computations
   can become very cumbersome, we work out in detail only three out of ten
   possible cases.},

Abstract = {Butterflies, together with vertebrates and higher plants, are often used
   for conservation studies and monitoring worldwide. This is due to the
   advanced development of their systematics, ecology and biogeography. In
   Mexico, studies on butterflies go back to the last century (Bialogia
   Centrali-Americana) and since then knowledge has advanced significantly.
   More than 1,800 species of butterflies in five families, 20 subfamilies,
   50 tribes and almost 500 genera have been already recognized. This
   information has appeared in more than one hundred monographs and books
   and in many papers published in at least 12 major periodical journals.
   The main synthetic results of the above work are: (1) Mexico holds 10\%
   of the Rhopalocera of the world and ranks among the ten richest
   countries in terms of butterflies; (2) our country and neighboring areas
   hold paleo- and neoendemic groups of the greatest interest, some of them
   relictual, mainly in the xeric parts of the north and west and in the
   mountain ranges of the south; (3) the richness pattern is independent of
   the endemism pattern because the richest areas are the tropical humid
   lowlands; (4) the areas with higher endemism and richness are those with
   the greatest physiographic, climatic and vegetational heterogeneity (e.
   g. Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz and Sierra de Juarez, Oaxaca, each one with
   about 35\% of the species richness), the conservation of butterfly
   diversity depends on habitat conservation because slight changes may
   induce local extinctions, but we still lack in-depth and long- term
   studies about these problems; and (5) Mexico presents several insular
   intracontinental patterns, which are the product of the disjunct and
   heterogeneus distribution of xeric and humid parts, which are the result
   of the complex biogeographical history of the country.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS},

Volume = {31},

Pages = {1003-1016},
Abstract = {The Chinampas are important historically and represent a special
   agroecosystem that has been sustainable for many years. However, their
   agricultural potential has currently decreased mainly because of
   irrigation with waste water from Mexico City, leading to progressive
   salinity and alkalinity problems and the subsequent general alteration
   on the agroecosystem. Chemical composition of the main groups of lipid
   molecules in anthropogenic organic soil from Xochimilco and Tlahuac
   Municipalities (Mexico) were investigated. The analysis performed
   included physicochemical characteristics of the soil and the
   distribution analysis of free alkanes and fatty acids. The successive
   accumulation stages of organic materials in these anthropogenic organic
   soils represent a source of irregular distribution in organic carbon,
   likewise the concentration of lipid extracts differed noticeably with
   depth. There is a vertical variability, where hydromorphic environment
   has played a key role in this variability. The major compounds
   identified in the soil lipid extracts by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry include series of linear and satured alkanes, fatty acids,
   as well as individual components such as sterols and hopanes. Most of
   the lipid components in these soil seem to have a biogenic origin
   (higher plants and microorganism biomass).},

   appropriate action for the preservation of biodiversity, the time
   required to both survey and document all taxa would outstrip current
   taxonomic expertise. It has been suggested that panbiogeographic and
   cladistic biogeographic methods can be useful tools for conservation
   biology. Some biogeographic methods, namely track or panbiogeographic
   analysis, parsimony analysis of endemicity, and cladistic biogeography,
   are briefly presented and their application to biodiversity conservation
   is discussed. Biogeographic atlases encompassing tracks, areas of
   endemism, and area cladograms are proposed as a mean to contribute to

   distribution and abundance of these organisms was measured. In order to
   study why the coral was distributed only within the medium-density
   stands of T. testudinum, but not in the high- or low- density stands of
   the seagrass, 3 size classes of M. areolata were transplanted into 3
   naturally occurring seagrass densities. Mortality, displacement,
   righting reaction, zooxanthellae, mitotic index, and chlorophyll a were
   evaluated for the transplanted colonies. High mortality of M. areolata
   was recorded in the low-density zone of T. testudinum, attributable to
   siltation and predation, whereas in the high-density zone of this
   seagrass, the coral was under stress, as indicated by a lowered
   zooxanthellae density. The fragile, arborescent algae Neogoniolithon sp.
   was found distributed only within the medium-density zone of T.
   testudinum, and M. areolata selectively recruited onto that algae.
   Experiments in which the coral and algae were separated in the
   medium-density seagrass zone demonstrated that Neogoniolithon sp. offers
   M, areolata adaptive and ecological advantages: its survivorship was
   significantly higher when attached to the algae than when this substrate
   was not available. Because of the natural distribution of Neogoniolithon
   sp., the coral did not recruit in zones that would cause it stress, or
   even death. M, areolata and Neogoniolithon sp, eventually separate
   because of the increase in size (and weight) of the coral, and the
   fragility of the algae. Thus, the distribution of Neogoniolithon sp.
   explained the distribution of M, areolata instead of the high negative
   correlation found between the density of T. testudinum and the coral.},

Abstract = {From the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian-Campanian) Huepac Chert
   Locality of the Tarahumara Formation, a new extinct aquatic plant of the
   Haloragaceae (Subclass: Rosidae), Tarahumara sophiae Hernandez-Castillo
   and Cevallos-Ferriz. is presented. It is reconstructed on the basis of
   both reproductive and vegetative organs preserved in chert. Its
   description and comparison with extant plants are based on the analysis
   of 350 permanent slides made with thin section and peel techniques. A
   mosaic of anatomical and morphological characters found in the extant
   Myriophyllum, Meziella, and Haloragodendron is used to characterize the
   new ta,von. The development from flower to fruit in the fossil plant
   follows similar stages found in some extant species of Myriophyllum.
   However, a floral cup is reported for the first time in the family, and
   it is compared to the persistent fused sepals (terminal corona) of
   Meziella. This plant reconstruction increases the morphological
   diversity of the Haloragaceae, demonstrates the presence of a new
   dispersal mechanism compared with those known for the family, suggests
   that this lineage had originated by at least the Upper Cretaceous, and
   refutes the interpretation of several haloragacean Tertiary reports as
   representing genera of extant plants.},

Abstract = {Many cosmological models of GRBs envision the energy source to be a
   cataclysmic stellar event leading to a relativistically expanding
   fireball. Particles are thought to be accelerated at shocks and produce
   nonthermal radiation. The highly variable temporal structure observed in
   most GRBs has significantly constrained models. By using different
   methods of statistical analysis in the time domain we show that the
   width of the pulses in GRBs time histories remain remarkably constant
   throughout the classic GRB phase. If the emission sites lie on a
   relativistically expanding shell, we determine both the amount of
   deceleration and the angular spread of the emitting region from the time
   dependency of the pulse width. We find no deceleration over at least 2/3
   of the burst duration and angular spreads of the complete emitting shell
   that are substancially smaller than Gamma(-1). The lack of temporal
   evolution of the pulse width should be explained by any fireball shock
   scenario.},

Abstract = {The Coastal Plain of Chiapas (southern Mexico) was formerly covered by
   large tracts of subhumid tropical forests bur is heavily deforested at
   present. In this region, 15 pastures were selected to characterize
   species composition of isolated trees, as well as to describe species
   composition, growth form patterns, and patterns of dispersal units in
   the vegetation growing under their canopies. The 65 recorded pasture
   trees belonged to 20 species and 11 families, of which Fabaceae and
   Moraceae were the most species-rich. Coccoloba barbadensis
   (Polygonaceae) and Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Fabaceae) were the most
   abundant and frequent trees in the studied pastures. More than half
   (55\%) of isolated tree species were fleshy-fruited. In the vegetation
   sampled under pasture trees, 134 species and 45 families were found.
   Fabaceae and Poaceae had the largest numbers of species. Herbs were the
   predominant growth form (46.3\%), followed by shrubs (23.9\%), trees
   (23.1\%), and lianas (2.2\%); 6 species could nor be placed in any
   growth form category. Most species of this flora were fleshy-fruited
   (43.3\%), followed by heavy, gravity-dispersed fruits (17.9\%). The
   analysis of dispersal units by growth form category confirmed the
   prevalence of fleshy fruits, although their predominance was not so
   obvious among herb species. Almost half (49.2\%) of the flora under
   pasture trees was typical of secondary vegetation; this pattern was true
   for herbs but not for most woody species, which were typical of primary
   vegetation. A numeric classification of the vegetation samples taken
   under pasture trees produced eight floristic groups, all of which were
   independent of the specific identity of pasture trees. No significant
   effect of dispersal unit type of pasture tree on the characteristics of
   the vegetation growing under them was found. Future attempts to
   re-create the original forest cover using isolated trees in pastures as
   regeneration foci should pay more attention to the maintenance of a
   large specific diversity independently of the dispersal types among
   these components of tropical landscapes.},

Abstract = {Metacystis truncata, a prostomatid loricate ciliate, was found attached
   to Thalassia testudinum, a dominant seagrass of the coral reef lagoons
   of Veracruz, Mexico. The morphology of the ciliate and its lorica were
   studied in living and stained specimens and in those prepared for
   scanning electron microscopy. The lorica is cylindrical (64.6-115 mu m)
   with a well-developed anterior neck and a sac reinforced by 15-26 rings.
   Cell body size is variable (19-91 mu m live), from ovoid to elongate;
   the terminal protruding vacuole is conspicuous in small and medium-sized
   individuals; the macronucleus is terminal in the elongate forms, or
   located near the midbody in the ovoid ones. This marine prostomatid
   colonizes both natural and artificial substrates such as narrow
   polyethylene strips placed in an aquarium. The highest density was found
   in the summer. The present study represents the first description of the
   lorica of M. truncata and the first record on T. testudinum shoots.},

Abstract = {The exact expression of the one-dimensional Boltzmann
   multiple-scattering coefficients, for the passage of particles through a
   slab of a given material, is obtained in terms of the single-scattering
   cross section of the material, including absorption. The remarkable
   feature of the result is that for multiple scattering in a metal, free
   from absorption, one recovers the well-known Landauer result for
   conduction electrons. In the case of particles, such as neutrons, moving
   through a weak absorbing media, Landuer's formula is modified due to the
   absorption cross section. For photons, in a strong absorbing media, one
   recovers the Lambert-Beer equation. In this latter case one may
   therefore speak of absorption-controlled diffusive processes.

   configuration mixing},
Journal = {OPTICAL MATERIALS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-73},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this work, the non-radiative energy transfer mechanism between a pair
   of distinct dopant ions in a monocrystalline matrix is reviewed, the
   transfer mechanism is contemplated as a result of the configuration
   mixing of the energy levels of the subsystem donor-acceptor couple. When
   this resonance is considerable, a strong mixing takes place between two
   of the wave functions of the involved ions, and this mixing results in
   an increased value of the probability of non-radiative energy transfer.
   On the other hand, Dexter's classical theory for non-radiative energy
   transfer can be applied as a limiting case when the energy resonance is
   neglected. The rate of non-radiative energy transfer has been calculated
   for various systems where this process has been observed, finding that,
   for specific energy levels of the subsystem pair the calculated
   non-radiative excitation transfer is in close agreement with the
   experimentally determined rate. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   showed a higher percentage of liver weight, with respect to whole body
   weight. Cholesterol serum levels increased in males with HD, but
   remained low in female mice. In the liver, total lipids and cholesterol
   levels increased in male mice with HD, but cholesterol remained
   unchanged in females. The addition of LVT to HD prevented the increase
   of serum and liver cholesterol levels in male mice. These results allow
   us to propose the CD-1 male-mouse as a model to evaluate the toxicity of

Abstract = {Recent work has indicated that a telegrapher's type equation may
   accurately describe the diffusion of photons in highly turbid media,
   specially during the ballistic regime of the process. On the other hand,
   calculations that have been made using the persistent random walk model
   (PRW) appear to contradict this result since the telegrapher's equation,
   for the case of very simple lattice geometries does not exist using PRW
   in 2 and 3 dimensions. In the present work we show how the continuous
   diffusion equations in 2D and 3D of PRW, in the weak coupling limit,
   provide an alternative theory for mesoscopic photon diffusion, showing
   that this problem can be studied using either the traditional
   telegrapher's equation or by the new approach provided by the continuum
   and discrete versions of PRW. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   are of interest because they show ferromagnetic order at very low

Abstract = {Purine nucleotides are formed de novo by a widespread biochemical route
   that may be of monophyletic origin, or are synthesized from preformed
   purine bases and nucleosides through different salvage pathways. Three
   monophyletic sets of purine salvage enzymes, each of which catalyzes
   mechanistically similar reactions, can be identified: (a) adenine-,
   xanthine-, hypoxanthine- and guanine-phosphoribosyltransferases, which
   are all homologous among themselves, as well as to nucleoside
   phosphorylases; (b) adenine deaminase, adenosine deaminase, and
   adenosine monophophate deaminase; acid (c) guanine reductase and inosine
   monophosphate dehydrogenase. These homologies support the idea that
   substrate specificity is the outcome of gene duplication, and that the
   purine nucleotide salvage pathways were assembled by a patchwork process
   that probably took place before the divergence of the three cell domains
   (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya). Based on the ability of adenine PRTase
   to catalyze the condensation of PRPP with 4-aminoimidazole-5-carboxamide
   (AICA), a simpler scheme of purine nucleotide biosynthesis is presented.
   This hypothetical route requires the prior evolution of PRPP
   biosynthesis. Since it has been argued that PRPP, nucleosides, and
   nucleotides are susceptible to hydrolysis, they are very unlikely
   prebiotic compounds. If this is the case, it implies that many purine
   salvage pathways appeared only after the evolution of phosphorylated
   sugar biosynthetic pathways made ribosides available.},

Abstract = {Self-similar fractals are useful models for soil solid and pore sets.
   The scaling properties of these fractals along a line and across an area

   the soil areal fractal dimension from the solid and pore set
   distributions along the lines, was proposed and tested with real macro-
   and micromorphological data on three soils of Mexico. The soil areal
   fractal dimension (D-a) was compared with the soil mass fractal
   dimension (D-m) estimated by two-dimensional binary image analysis,
   separately for solids and pores. Both methods are based on the
   box-counting technique and are suitable for determining the soil `box'
   or `capacity' fractal dimension, that seems to be apt to estimate the
   alternative filling of an area by a fractal set of solids and pores.
   This paper examines the relations between the fractal dimensions
   obtained along a line, across an area and directly from the image.
   Analysis of D-a and D-m data seems to suggest that both soil genesis and
   management practice can contribute to areal fractal dimension dynamics.
   It was shown that fractal dimensions are useful parameters able to
   monitor tillage influence on soil properties and to estimate the degree
   of soil compaction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita compressus (H. Milne Edwards)) on
   Isabel island, Mexico, prefer Nerita (Ritena) scabricosta (Lanark 1822)
   over other species of shells. Nerita scabricosta, the lightest species
   of shell, has the highest internal volume/weight ratio (IV/W ratio) of
   all species available at the island. Heavier shells (low IV/W ratio) are
   more costly to carry and may restrain growth. We hypothesized that crabs
   will search for shells with high IV/W ratios to save energy, and
   predicted that in every individual shell-exchange crabs will prefer a
   shell with a higher IV/W ratio. Observations of spontaneous aggressive
   shell-exchange interactions in nature between crabs carrying preferred
   shells (with high IV/W ratio) and crabs using less preferred species of
   shells (low IV/W ratio) support this idea. By inducing individual shell
   exchanges in the field, we experimentally confirmed the preference for
   shells with high IV/W ratio, and we also showed that crabs prefer larger
   shells over those they were bearing. Moving to a larger but not heavier
   shell may facilitate growth though saving energy that would otherwise be
   spent in locomotion. High growth rates seem to be advantageous because
   size is a correlate of fertility, since large males apparently have more
   access to females, and large females produce larger clutches, thus
   indicating the possible reproductive benefits for preferred light and
   large shells. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {Biomarkers to ozone exposure were sought at the macroscopic and
   microscopic levels to determine the etiology of the injury in Abies
   religiosa from a forest known to be polluted with ozone. Symptoms in the
   needles were mainly manifest on the adaxial side and consisted of
   whitish stippling that turned into larger and reddish mottled lesions,
   finally joining each other until they covered the surface. The injury
   progressed from the base to the tip of the leaf which coincided with its
   pattern of development, this became evident within different types of
   cells along the palisade parenchyma where the injury was located. Cells
   classified as being old and injured were prominent even in young needles
   of trees exposed to ozone, not in those from the control site. These
   alterations, the early abscission of the leaves and the accelerated
   deterioration of the trees manifest a premature senescence process which
   is characteristic of ozone injury. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {A calculation for the generalized longitudinal stress modulus and
   electric conductivity in an ionic-viscoelastic medium is presented. The
   system is described within the framework of extended irreversible
   thermodynamics in terms of the regular conserved variables and of an
   additional set of independent variables consisting of the stress tensor,
   its trace, and the electric flux. Using the standard procedure, we
   derive the time evolution equations for the additional variables. These
   equations are used to obtain general wave vector and frequency dependent
   expressions for measurable properties of the system. We obtain for the
   linear case results that have not been derived previously in the
   literature. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Structural parameters and energy have been calculated for C1-3 and C-9
   clusters using density functional theory through the deMon program. The
   C1-3 clusters were fully optimized using deMon; different basis sets
   were tested in order to choose the suitable one to be used in the C-9
   clusters. In the case of C-2 the results were compared with experimental
   values. DZVP2 basis was selected because it always gave the closest
   value to the experimental data. The C-9 carbon clusters were designed in
   relation to C(100) diamond surface. The energies of the nonrelaxed and
   relaxed surfaces with and without hydrogen were calculated. in the same
   way CH3-relaxed and CH2-relaxed species were calculated. The diamond
   growth mechanism proposed in the literature was evaluated by an energy
   analysis. The C-CH3 distance is reported. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {Quantitative morphological methods were used to analyse the
   histomorphometric changes and variations in the number and size of cells
   from diverse cellular populations in testes of newly hatched chicks
   treated with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during embryonic
   development.
   The tissue was fixed and embedded in Epon and sections were
   morphometrically measured under light microscopy, using point counting
   for volume densities and the Floderus equation to determine numerical
   density. The average volume of the individual cell was determined by
   dividing the volume density by the numerical density.
   Results indicate that FSH administration causes an increase in the
   number of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, as well as enlargement of the
   individual Sertoli cells leading consequently to an increase in the
   diameter and volume density of the testicular seminiferous tubules.
   Results also reveal an increase in the volume density of the
   interstitial cords of the Leydig cells, this expansion is due to the
   enlargement of the individual Leydig cells and not to an increase in
   their number, which remains constant. We conclude that testes of chick
   embryos are able to respond to FSH treatment, as revealed by the changes
   in the number and size of the cells conforming the diverse cellular
   populations of the testis.
   FSH treatment during embryonic development induces histomorphometric
   changes in both the interstitial tissue and seminiferous tubules,
   accelerating their growth and differentiation.},

Title = {Effects of hypophyseal hormones on transcription and RNA export to the
   cytoplasm},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {236},
Number = {2},
Pages = {519-526},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The effects of hypophyseal hormones on RNA transcription and export to
   the cytoplasm were evaluated by means of light microscopic quantitative
   autoradiography. Normal or hypophysectomized rats as well as
   hypophysectomized animals treated with the follicle-stimulating hormone
   (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), were used and the corresponding
   target cells (Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, epithelial thyroid gland
   cells, or adrenal cortical cells, respectively) were analyzed. Moreover,
   the variations of the concentration of perichromatin granules were
   correlated with the changes of the nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA labeling.
   Hypophysectomy causes a decrease of nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling and
   a large increase of the number of perichromatin granules in the four
   cell types studied. The administration of any of the four hormones
   brings about an increase in the rate of RNA transport to the cytoplasm
   in the target cells, within short periods (15 to 135 min). This
   augmentation of the RNA export takes place before any significant
   increase of the transcription rate, suggesting that the exiting RNA was
   previously stored in the nucleus. This is in agreement with a decrease
   of the number of perichromatin granules detected as early as 30 min
   after the administration of the hormones. Previous work demonstrated
   that steroid hormones such as estradiol and testosterone have similar
   effects on their target cells. All these observations indicate that the
   regulation of the RNA transport to the cytoplasm is an important means
   of rapid posttranscriptional modulation of the expression of genetic
   information that can mediate the early action of various regulatory
   factors. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {We consider the sequence of fluctuation processes associated with the
   empirical measures of the interacting particle system approximating the
   d-dimensional McKean-Vlasov equation and prove that they are tight as
   continuous processes with values in a precise weighted Sobolev space.
   More precisely, we prove that these fluctuations belong uniformly (with
   respect to the size of the system and to time) to W-0(-(1+D),2D) and
   converge in C({[}0,T], W-0(-(2+2D),D)) to a Ornstein- Uhlenbeck process
   obtained as the solution of a Langevin equation in W-0(-(4+2D),D), where
   D is equal to 1 + {[}d/2]. It appears in the proofs that the spaces
   W-0(-(1+D),2D) and W-0(-(2+2D),D) are minimal Sobolev spaces in which to
   immerse the fluctuations, which was our aim following a physical point

Pages = {2899-2908},

Abstract = {In this paper an extensive investigation is done of the linear stability
   of a film falling down a vertical rotating cylinder. Two cases are
   considered: flow in the outside and flow in the inside of the cylinder.
   To this end, a system of differential equations which describe the
   instability is solved numerically with the Runge-Kutta fourth and sixth
   order methods. We show that in different circumstances the azimuthal
   disturbances become the most unstable when the rotation is taken into
   account. Moreover, a splitting of the azimuthal modes appears due to the
   Coriolis force. In the case of flow in the inside there is a threshold
   in the centrifugal force above which the-flow is linearly stable.
   Besides, new results for the nonrotating case are also obtained. (C)

Abstract = {The Jeffery-Hamel flow is analyzed by making use of a mechanical

   temporal stability of some flows for small widths of the channel. An
   argument is given to show that pure inflow should be unstable for small
   widths of the channel, a result which is corroborated by our numerical
   calculations. We find that the flows IOI and IO are unstable for
   Reynolds numbers near zero. A stability window for some asymmetric flows

Abstract = {For an infinite cardinal alpha, we say that a subset B of a space X is
   C-alpha-compact in X if for every continuous function f:X --> R-alpha,
   f{[}B] is a compact subset of R-alpha. This concept slightly generalizes
   the notion of alpha-pseudocompactness introduced by J.F. Kennison: a
   space X is alpha-pseudocompact if X is C-alpha-compact in itself. If
   alpha = omega, then we say C-compact instead of C-omega-compact and
   omega-pseudocompactness agrees with pseudocompactness. We generalize
   Tamano's theorem on the pseudocompactness of a product of two spaces as
   follows: let A subset of or equal to X and B subset of or equal to Y be
   such that A is z-embedded in X. Then the following three conditions are
   equivalent: (1) A x B is C-alpha-compact in X x Y; (2) A and B are
   C-alpha-compact in X and Y, respectively, and the projection map pi:X x
   Y --> X is a z(alpha)-map with respect to A x B and A; and (3) A and B
   are C-alpha-compact in X and Y, respectively, and the projection map
   pi:X x Y --> X is a strongly z(alpha)-map with respect to A x B and A
   (the z(alpha)-maps and the strongly z(alpha)-maps are natural
   generalizations of the z-maps and the strongly z-maps, respectively).
   The degree of C alpha-compactness of a C-compact subset B of a space X
   is defined by: rho(B, X) = infinity if B is compact, and if B is not
   compact, then rho(B, X) = sup\{alpha:B is C-alpha-compact in X\}. We
   estimate the degree of pseudocompactness of locally compact
   pseudocompact spaces, topological products and Sigma-products. We also
   establish the relation between the pseudocompact degree and some other
   cardinal functions. In the context of uniform spaces, we show that if A
   is a bounded subset of a uniform space (X, U), then A is C-alpha-compact
   in (X) over cap, where ((X) over cap, (U) over cap) is the completion of
   (X, U) iff f(A) is a compact subset of R-alpha from every uniformly
   continuous function from X into R-alpha; we characterize the
   C-alpha-compact subsets of topological groups; and we also prove that if
   \{G(i):i is an element of I\} is a set of topological groups and A(i) is
   a C-alpha-compact subset of G(alpha) for all i is an element of I, then
   Pi(i is an element of) I A(i) is a C-alpha-compact subset of Pi(i is an
   element of I) G(i). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {Two different interstitial collagens were isolated from the muscle layer
   of the marine polychaete worm Hermodice sp. (Annelida). Collagens were
   solubilized after limited pepsin digestion and fractionated by a
   differential sale precipitation procedure. Both types of interstitial
   collagen (Hermodice collagens A and B) appear to be homotrimers with
   subunit compositions (alpha A)(3) and (alpha B)(3), respectively. Both
   types of subunits alpha A and alpha B migrate in SDS-PAGE between the
   alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) subunits of type I collagen with an apparent
   molecular weight of 100,000. SLS crystallites from Hermodice collagen A
   exhibited a band pattern similar to that of vertebrate type I collagen,
   whereas collagen B showed a very different band pattern, suggesting
   substantial sequence differences between the two types of collagen. The
   amino acid composition of Hermodice collagens A and B showed marked
   differences; notwithstanding, both collagens fit the pattern of
   interstitial collagens. The A:B ratio is 1.9, as determined from the
   amino acid analysis. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

   examine the convergence rates and properties of these two popular
   optimisation algorithms as used in computing the maximum likelihood
   estimates from regression models with t-distributed errors. By
   approaching this computing problem through the use of two data
   augmentation schemes, as well as variations of these well-known

Abstract = {Dissolved oxygen is the most important limiting factor in the intensive
   cultivation of shrimp species. The critical oxygen level and its effects
   upon the energy metabolism of postlarvae (PL10-18) Of Penaeus setiferus
   and Penaeus schmitti exposed to diverse salinities were estimated. In
   both species the critical oxygen level (COL; estimated as the point of
   inflection of the curve obtained from the relation between the oxygen
   consumption and the oxygen concentration) was affected by salinity
   concentration, In P. schmitti, the COL was 5 mg l(-1) for salinities of
   38, 30, 20 and 15 parts per thousand, and 4.5 mg l(-1) for animals kept
   at 25 parts per thousand salinity. In P. setiferus, the COL was 5.0 mg
   l(-1) in 37, 30, 25, 20 and 10 parts per thousand salinities and 4.5 mg
   l(-1) in 15, 5 and 1 parts per thousand salinities. The energy deficit
   (END; deficit of metabolic energy) caused by the metabolic oxygen
   critical concentration was in P. schmitti 13.9\% (38 parts per thousand
   salinity) and 26.3\% (30 parts per thousand salinity), with intermediate
   values of 17.2, 22.7 and 24.7\% in 25, 20 and 15 parts per thousand
   salinities, respectively, I:or P. setiferus, the END was between 9.1\%
   (1 parts per thousand salinity) and 25.1\% (30 parts per thousand
   salinity), with intermediate values for the remaining salinities, Based
   on these data, the optimum salinity for P, setiferus postlarvae was
   between 5 parts per thousand and 15 parts per thousand, and was 25 parts
   per thousand for P. schmitti postlarvae. At these salinities the
   tolerance for the decrease in the oxygen concentration was greater than
   in the rest of the salinities, The high COL obtained for the postlarvae
   of both species indicates that the culture conditions must be carefully
   maintained at this developmental stage to obtain the maximum metabolic
   performance of the shrimp. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the transient conjugate heat transfer process
   between two counterflowing forced streams separated by a wall with
   finite thermal conductivity. The influence of the longitudinal heat
   conduction through the wall on the overall heat transfer fates is very
   important and has been analytically deduced. We present a classification
   of the solutions of the problem in terms of two main parameters:
   epsilon, the ratio of thickness to the height of the wall, which is
   small in our analysis, and alpha, measuring the ratio of the thermal
   resistance of one of the boundary layers to the thermal resistance of
   the wall. Conditions under which longitudinal conduction and transversal
   temperature variations are important in the solid are clarified. In the
   asymptotic limit alpha --> infinity and using the Lighthill
   approximation, it can be shown that the balance equations reduce to a
   single integrodifferential equation with only the parameters alpha,
   beta, where beta relates the boundary layer thicknesses. This limit is
   analyzed using regular perturbation techniques. On the other hand, for
   alpha --> 0, the governing equations can be solved using asymptotic
   techniques. The evolution in time and space of the temperature of the
   plate has been obtained in closed form and compared with the numerical
   solution for different values of the parametric set. In general, close
   to the studied limits, a very good agreement is achieved.},

Abstract = {The in situ distribution of phosphorus was studied in unstained
   ultrathin sections of salivary glands of Chironomus tentans and Ch.
   thummi larvae using elemental mapping by means of an energy-filtering
   transmission electron microscope. This distribution was related to the
   structures observed using contrast enhancement with inelastically
   scattered electrons at 250 eV. This procedure demonstrated that a
   phosphorus-containing fibril about 2 nm thick is the common substructure
   of the following nuclear ribonucleoprotein structural constituents: the
   Balbiani ring granules, their precursor fibrils seen at the sites of
   transcription, especially at the Balbiani rings, and the fibres
   traversing the pore of the nuclear envelope. These phosphorus-containing
   thin fibrils are sensitive to RNase. Thicker substructural features of
   the Balbiani ring granules, occurring as a curved ribbon on a dense
   particle, appear to be formed by the dense packing of the fine fibrils.
   The Balbiani ring granules located near the nuclear envelope are often
   linked to it by fine filaments.},

Abstract = {Sodium azide (NaN3), a potent mutagen for bacteria and barley, was
   tested for somatic mutation and mitotic recombination induction in wing
   imaginal disc cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Comparisons were made
   among inversion-free flr(3)/mwh, inversion-heterozygous TM3, Ser/mwh,
   and inversion-foe, high bioactivation OR(R), flr(3)/mwh flies. Third
   instar larvae were exposed chronically for 48 h to sodium azide at 0.5,
   0.63. 0.75, 0.88 and 1.0 mM. The frequencies of spots per wing obtained
   in the three kinds of progeny scored were compared. In inversion-free
   flies, sodium azide induced large single and total spots at all
   concentrations tested, and small single and twin spots at 0.75 mM and
   higher concentrations. In contrast, it failed to increase the frequency
   of small and large single spots in inversion-heterozygous flies. In high
   bioactivation flies (which are inversion-free), sodium azide increased
   the frequency of large single spots at 0.63, 0.88 and 1.0 mM and the
   frequency of total spots at 0.63 mM. From the absence of genotoxic
   activity observed in inversion-heterozygous flies it is concluded that
   sodium azide induces exclusively mitotic recombination in wing somatic
   cells of Drosophila melanogaster larvae after chronic exposure. This
   recombinogenic activity is reduced in the presence of high bioactivation
   capacity.},

Abstract = {A review and analysis about several aspects on the modular construction
   in plants is presented, with emphasis on the ecological and evolutive
   consequences of this kind of construction. First of all, fundamentals
   that allow the reader to follow all the concepts without definition
   problems are given. Modifications done to the population models are
   analized, in order to incorporate the fact that plants are constructed
   by iterative unities. With concrete examples, consequences of modular
   construction in. form, size and regulation are described. Subsequently
   biological interactions with modular construction are approached, such
   as the relations that results from the competition between clonal
   organisms. The second section of the review is concentreated on the
   analysis of the concepts of modularity and clonality in the world of
   marine macroalgae. The definition of module in marine macroalgae is
   discussed with the conclusion that they can be conceptualized as modular
   organisms. All the ecological and evolutive consequences, analyzed for
   terrestrial vascular plants can be applied to the study of the ecology
   of marine macroalgae.},

   impaired mobility?},
Journal = {COPEIA},
Year = {1997},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-115},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {Females of some lizard species exhibit lower body temperatures (T(b)s)
   when reproductive (gravid or pregnant) than when not reproductive. Two
   hypotheses have been invoked to explain this phenomenon. One, the
   thermal stress hypothesis, is that the thermal optimum for embryos is
   lower than that of the female, and females thus actively select
   relatively low T(b)s. The other, the encumbrance hypothesis, is that
   females are encumbered by their clutch/litter and thus passively accept
   relatively low T(b)s. We collected field data on the thermal biology of
   Sceloporus grammicus at a high elevation site in Mexico during two
   seasons. In March, when thermoregulation was facilitated by high ambient
   temperature, Lizards had high T(b)s overall, and reproductive females
   had significantly lower T(b)s than males; these observations were in
   accord with the thermal stress hypothesis. In June/July, when
   thermoregulation was difficult as a result of low ambient temperatures,
   lizards had low T(b)s overall, and reproductive females had considerably
   lower T(b)s than nonreproductive females. Thus, when thermal
   opportunities were limited, reproductive females had more difficulty
   thermoregulating than did nonreproductive females. These observations
   were in accord with the encumbrance hypothesis. The encumbrance
   hypothesis was also supported by the observation that females grew more
   slowly when reproductive than when nonreproductive. Thus, we suggest
   that the thermal stress and the encumbrance hypotheses are not
   alternatives but are complementary explanations for the thermal behavior
   of female Sceloporus.},

Title = {Environmental deterioration in rural Mexico: An examination of the
   concept},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {316-329},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mexico, like many other countries worldwide, faces an environmental
   crisis of enormous proportions. While in its urban dimension
   environmental problems are more similar to those of developed countries,
   in rural areas they are analogous to those prevailing in developing
   countries. In rural areas, which are largely devoted to food production
   based on traditional methods, environmental concerns are mainly related
   to phenomena such as deforestation and soil erosion, and not to chemical
   pollution or ozone-layer depletion, which are the primary concerns of
   the broad public. The future food production in these regions and the
   possibility of improving the life quality of their inhabitants depend on
   our understanding of these kinds of problems, and our capacity to
   confront them.
   An overview of the theoretical framework on environmental deterioration
   reveals a lack of definition of the concepts and terms related to this
   issue. Several terms, such as `'desertification'' and `'fragmentation,''
   among others, are widely used by ecologists but are clearly not
   synonymous with environmental deterioration. A consequence of this
   vagueness is the lack of clear criteria to differentiate areas that are
   only moderately modified from those in which true deterioration has
   occurred. Also, unified methods to efficiently evaluate environmental
   deterioration in rural areas are lacking.
   We briefly present a case study in which environmental deterioration was
   evaluated in La Montana, an extremely poor and climatically and
   topographically heterogeneous rural region inhabited by indigenous
   people in southern Mexico. Three deterioration categories are recognized
   based on degree of human influence, proportion of vegetation cover, and
   soil erosion severity. Use of air photogrammetry supplemented with field
   surveys revealed that 13\% of La Montana is already damaged (i.e.,
   lacking native vegetation and affected, perhaps irreversibly, by severe
   erosion), while 36\% is altered (i.e., where native vegetation is
   substantially modified, but productive activities are still possible).
   In turn, almost three quarters of the land in the latter category is at
   high risk of becoming damaged. An analysis of the patterns of land-use
   changes around selected villages for the period 1979-1992 showed local
   annual deforestation rates ranging between 1 and 17\%, depending upon
   climatic conditions.
   Based on the conceptual review and the analysis of the case study, we
   suggest that environmental deterioration comprises at least three
   clearly distinct dimensions: the abiotic setting, the biological
   attributes, and the social characteristics of the process. Finally, we
   define environmental deterioration as any modification of the
   environment that implies a reduction or loss of its physical and
   biological qualities, caused by natural phenomena or human activities,
   ultimately representing a decrease in the availability of ecosystem
   goods and services to human populations.
   The methods used to evaluate environmental deterioration at La Montana
   allowed us to separate modifications that cause deterioration from those
   that do not. This investigation, carried out in a relatively short time
   and with a minimum financial investment, yielded a satisfactory
   assessment of the state of the environment at the regional and community
   scales, recognizing early indicators of deterioration. This approach may
   be particularly useful in rural regions that share many characteristics
   with La Montana, such as critical environmental problems, extreme
   poverty, and insufficient background information about these issues.},

Abstract = {The toxic effect of waterborne nitrite on the energy budget of juvenile
   grass carp was measured. In grass carp exposed to nitrite, the ingestion
   rates were unaffected, whereas assimilation efficiency and assimilation
   were reduced. The respiratory rate decreased with the nitrite exposure,
   most probably attributed to metahemoglobin formation in fish blood and
   to decreased swimming activity. The nitrogen excretion rate increased in
   fish exposed to nitrite. This could be a result of an increase in
   protein catabolism and may be an important physiological adaptation to
   offset the effects of nitrite toxicity. Nitrite exposure reduced energy
   channelized to somatic growth, the gross growth efficiency and survival
   in carp exposed to the highest nitrite concentrations. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {H-3(+) and D-3(+) molecular ions in their ground slate have been
   produced by using a filament-type ion source. This was achieved by
   increasing the ion source pressure up to 0.82 Torr. These molecular ion
   beams were used in collision with He to study the polar dissociation of
   H-3(+) and D-3(+). The polar dissociating channel for H-3(+) with He was
   used to qualitatively verify the internal vibrational energy of the
   initial H-3(+) ions by observing the protons in coincidence with H-
   fragments. Variation of the source pressure influenced the vibrational
   population of the initial H-3(+) ions, and this was reflected in the
   distribution of the coincident H+ and H- fragments resulting from H-3(+)
   ions in their ground state.},

Abstract = {The scaling laws of the temperature structure functions and their
   relation with those of velocity have been experimentally studied. The
   relationship between the dissipative scales for velocity and the
   temperature is first investigated. In agreement with recent numerical
   simulations of Pumir (1994), it is found that, for Prandtl number close
   to 1, the dissipation scale for a scalar is smaller than that of
   velocity. Thus temperature structure functions present a larger scaling
   interval than that of the velocity. The intermittent corrections of
   scaling are then analyzed. It is shown that, as proposed in literature
   (R. Benzi et al., 1992), the second-order structure function is affected
   only by the velocity intermittency. This structure function is then used
   as the reference for testing the applicability of the extended
   self-similarity (ESS) to the passive scalar case. ESS holds, but in a
   narrower interval than that observed in velocity statistics. Finally, a
   hierarchy for the temperature structure functions, similar to that
   proposed by She and Leveque (1994) for the velocity field, is introduced
   and experimentally tested.},

   equations are reduced to a system of three differential equations with
   three parameters: the Prandtl number of the fluid, Pr, a non-dimensional
   plate thermal conductivity alpha and the aspect ratio of the plate
   epsilon. The nondimensional cooling time depends mainly on
   alpha/epsilon(2), obtaining a minimum of this time for values of 1 much
   greater than alpha much greater than epsilon(2).},

Abstract = {We examined the expression of interstitial collagenase and its enzymatic
   activity in lung damage induced by tobacco smoke. Guinea pigs were
   exposed to the smoke of 20 cigarettes per day from 1-8 wk. Age-matched
   guinea pigs were used as controls. At 6 and 8 wk of smoke exposure,
   lungs exhibited interstitial and peribronchiolar inflammation and
   moderate emphysematous changes. In situ hybridization of injured lungs
   revealed patchy expression of collagenase mRNA mainly in macrophages but
   also in alveolar epithelial and interstitial cells. Immunoreactive
   protein was detected in alveolar macrophages and in the alveolar walls
   and interstitium. Collagenolytic activity increased beginning in the 4th
   wk of exposure (0.7 +/- 0.43 mu g collagen degraded/mg collagen
   incubated relative to 0.23 +/- 0.14 in controls; P < 0.05). At 6 and 8
   wk, values were 0.85 +/- 0.34 and 0.98 +/- 0.33 compared with 0.25 +/-
   0.11 and 0.26 +/- 13 in controls (P < 0.005 and 0.001). Collagen
   concentration decreased from 50.7 +/- 8.5 mg/g dry wt in control lungs
   to 40.2 +/- 5.0 and 42.9 +/- 6.0 at 6 and 8 wk of exposure, respectively
   (P < 0.05). These results strongly suggest that increased interstitial
   collagen degradation plays a role in the development of lung emphysema.},

Abstract = {A Hankel partial contraction is a Hankel matrix such that not all of its
   entries are determined, but in which every well-defined submatrix is a
   contraction. We address the problem of whether a Hankel partial
   contraction in which the upper left triangle is known can be completed
   to a contraction. It is known that the 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 cases can be
   solved, and that 4 x 4 Hankel partial contractions cannot always be
   completed. We introduce a technique that allows us to exhibit concrete
   examples of such 4 x 4 matrices, and to analyze in detail the dependence
   of the solution set on the given data. At the same time, we obtain
   necessary and sufficient conditions on the given cross-diagonals in
   order for the matrix to be completed. We also study the problem of
   extending a contractive Hankel block of size n to one Of size n + 1. (C)

   described a new type of phosphorus-rich small granular ribonucleoprotein
   (RNP) component in the nucleoplasm of these cells; an attempt is made in
   the present work to estimate the phosphorus content of this component by
   the above mentioned method, using ribosomes as internal standard.
   Results show that these RNP granules contain, on average 3600 phosphorus

Abstract = {The dynamic equilibrium of extracellular matrix (ECM) under different
   physiological conditions is a consequence of the balance between the
   regulation of synthesis and degradation of ECM components. Matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of structurally related
   zinc-dependent endopeptidases, are the physiological mediators of matrix
   remodeling. The expression and activity of these enzymes are highly
   regulated at several intra- and extracellular levels, so that in vivo
   enzymatic activity is the final result of a complex series of events
   including gene expression, zymogen activation, matrix binding, and
   enzymatic inhibition. MMPs are expressed at low levels in normal adult
   tissues, and their upregulation appears to play an important role in the
   development of a number of pathological processes. In acute lung injury,
   a disorder characterized by a severe disruption of the gas exchange
   alveolo-capillary structures, the upregulation of interstitial
   collagenase and gelatinases A and B strongly suggests that MMPs
   contribute to acute lung damage by facilitating the migration of
   inflammatory cells, as well as to the disruption of basement membrane
   components and extracellular matrix remodeling.},

Abstract = {Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abnormal proliferation of
   mesenchymal cells, specifically fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and by
   the accumulation of excessive amounts of matrix proteins, mainly
   collagens. The development of this pathological process is preceded by
   an inflammatory response, often dominated by macrophages and
   lymphocytes, which is mediated by the local release of chemoattractant
   factors, acting coordinately with an upregulation of cell-surface
   adhesion molecules. A subsequent persisting fibroproliferative reaction,
   in both interstitial and intraalveolar spaces, with progressive collagen
   accumulation distorts the lung architecture irreversibly. Excessive
   collagen deposition is the result of an imbalance in the collagen
   turnover rates characterized by a transient increase in collagen
   synthesis and a decrease in collagen degradation. Fibrosis is considered
   otherwise to be the final common pathway of a variety of lung disorders,
   and in this context, the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis implies the
   recognition of an advanced stage in the evolution of a complex process
   of abnormal repair.},

Abstract = {Bahia Fosforescente, Puerto Rico, is well-known because of
   bioluminiscence caused by high concentrations of dinoflagellates.
   However, the specific composition of dinoflagellates has not been
   studied in detail. Several samples taken during 1975-1987 with net were
   analysed to study the dinoflagellates in the bay. Twenty-six taxa were
   identified, including 19 species, 3 varieties, and one form, together
   with three species not fully identified, all of them thecate. The valid,
   currently recognized names, as well as some synonyms are given, together
   with references, illustrations and distribution data. This study shows
   the constant presence of the species responsible for the bioluminiscence
   in the bay, Pyrodinium bahamense. The taxa Ceratium hircus and
   Dinophysis caudata var. ventricosa also occurred in all seasons. The
   genus Protoperidinium is represented by the greatest number of species
   in the bay (15). The unique hydrographic characteristics registered in
   the bay, such as the tidal and wind-driven mechanisms make possible the
   diversity of typically planktonic dinoflagellates in a shallow
   environment, although one benthic form was also found.},

Abstract = {Morphological studies were carried out on Laurencia gemmifera and L.
   poiteaui from the Nichupte Lagoon System, Quintana Roo, Mexico. These
   species share morphological similarities and possess features
   intermediate between the subgenera Laurencia Lamouroux and Chondrophycus
   Tokida et Saito, including secondary pit-connections between adjacent
   cortical cells and a right-angle arrangement of the tetrasporangia. They
   are, however, easily differentiated by their respective habits and
   anatomical details. Vegetative and reproductive features of Laurencia
   gemmifera and L. poiteaui are reported here. Despite the fact that the
   two species share characteristics common to both subgenera Laurencia and
   Chondrophycus, they appear to be more closely related to subgenus
   Chondrophycus.},

Abstract = {The aim of this project has been to study and compare the ciliate
   populations present in rotating biological reactors treating three
   different wastewaters. Wastewaters chosen were a maize mill (nejayote),
   a sugarcane/ethyl alcohol plant (vinasses) and a recycled paper mill
   (whitewaters). The initial dissolved organic contents, measured as
   soluble chemical oxygen demand (GOD) and biochemical oxygen demand in
   five days (BOD5), were 2040+/-150 mg COD L(-1) and 585+/-5 mg BOD5 L(-1)
   for nejayote; 2000+/-20 mg COD L(-1) and 640+/-5 mg BOD5 L(-1) for
   vinasses and 960+/-200 mg COD L(-1) and 120+/-10 mg BOD5 L(-1) for
   whitewaters. Results obtained indicate that ciliated protozoa
   proliferated in the different chambers of each rotating biological
   reactor (RBR). Saprobity indices, as a quantitative evaluation
   parameter, indicate that there are no universal species of ciliates
   associated with specific BOD5 concentrations. Therefore, the number of
   species of ciliates present in the effluent indicate qualitatively the
   efficiency of removal of pollution from the wastewaters during treatment
   in the rotating biological reactors.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyse the transient condensation process of saturated

   uniform cooling rate on the other surface of the plate, applied at a

   as well as the thermal inertia for the plate, are considered. The
   nondimensional governing equations are reduced to a system of four
   partial differential equations with six nondimensional parameters. The
   transient evolution of the condensed layer thickness and the temperature
   of the plate are obtained using different realistic limits,including the
   cases of very good and poor conducting plates. Copyright (C) 1996

Volume = {10},

Pages = {476-483},

Abstract = {In this article we analyze the steady-state conjugate heat transfer
   process between two counterflowing forced streams separated by a wall
   with finite thermal conductivity, The influence of the longitudinal heat
   conduction through the wall is very important on the overall heat
   transfer rates and has been analytically deduced, The most important
   parameters are denoted by alpha, beta, and epsilon. The parameter alpha
   corresponds to the ratio of the solid heat conduction in the
   longitudinal direction to the convected heat towards the hotter fluid,
   beta is the relationship between the thermal boundary-layer thickness of
   both fluids, and epsilon is the aspect ratio of the plate. In the
   asymptotic limit alpha --> infinity and using the Lighthill
   approximation, it can be shown that the balance equations reduce to a
   single integro-differential equation with only the parameters alpha and
   beta. This limit is analyzed using regular perturbation techniques, On
   the other hand, for alpha --> 0, the governing equations can also be
   solved using asymptotic methods. The distribution of the temperature of
   the plate as well as the overall heat transfer rates have been obtained
   in closed form and compared with the numerical solution for different
   values of the parametric set, In general, close to the analyzed limits,
   a good agreement is achieved.},

Abstract = {Seed germination experiments were conducted on six woody leguminous
   species which are widely used by rural inhabitants of a mountainous
   tropical subhumid region in southern Mexico. Conditions for optimum
   germination were sought in nursery conditions by applying various hot
   water treatments (1 min, 3 min, 5 min and 10 min in boiling water) and
   scarification to seeds of differing storage durations. Lysiloma
   divaricata germinated promptly without any treatment. Leucaena esculenta
   and L. macrophylla seeds germinated more readily after boiling (1 min),
   regardless of storage duration. Acacia species (A. cochliacantha, A.
   farnesiana and A. pennatula) had optimum germination with scarification
   treatments for all storage durations, while short-time boiling (1 min, 3
   min) of their seeds increased germination only moderately. Seeds of
   species typical of primary vegetation lost viability sooner than those
   of species more frequent in disturbed areas. From these results, seed
   handling routines and germination pre-treatments practices can be
   derived for these species, all of which can potentially be used in
   reforestation on degraded soils.},

Abstract = {We previously reported on the induction by vitamin A of gallstones, rich

   reported that the phenolic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)
   potentiates the hepatotoxicity of vitamin A, In the present work we have
   tested the effect of BHT on the lithogenicity of vitamin A and on bile
   composition, The urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate was
   determined to assess a possible asymptomatic bone resorption due to
   vitamin A toxicity, and/or an effect of BHT on the homeostasis of
   calcium and phosphate. Three groups of 18 male hamsters were fed with
   the following diets for 70 days: Group 1, Purina Nutricubes (DB); Group
   2, DB + 25,000 IU\% retinol acetate (DL); Group 3, DL + 500 mg\% BHT.
   Vitamin A (Group 2) induced gallstones in 78\% of the animals, increased
   bile flow and biliary phosphate and calcium concentrations, and reduced
   those of bile salt, cholesterol and phospholipid, BHT (Group 3) reduced
   gallstone frequency to 5.5\%, and decreased biliary phosphate, calcium
   and lipids toward more normal concentrations, Vitamin A alone or with
   BHT did not significantly affect food intake or urinary excretion of

Abstract = {The karyotypic status of the mesquite lizard, Sceloporus grammicus, was
   investigated at two localities at Santuario Mapethe, Hidalgo, Mexico. A
   total of 23 different karyotypes was recorded from the 36 individuals
   examined. individual lizards were heterozygous at up to four
   chromosomes. Karyotypic differences were attributed to Robertsonian
   fission/fusions and pericentric inversions involving the
   macrochromosomes. The polymorphisms generally conformed to
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium suggesting a lack of underdominance for most
   rearrangements. The extreme chromosomal polytypy observed at Santuario
   Mapethe is hypothesized to result from parapatric hybridization between
   two chromosome races.},

Abstract = {The calorigenic effect of feeding (apparent heat increment, AHI) and
   post-prandial nitrogen excretion (PPNE) were measured in postlarval (PL
   25-30) Penaeus setiferus, P. schmitti, P. duorarum and P. notialis fed a
   fixed ration of 3 mg/animal using purified diets with 40, 50, 60, or
   65\% protein, Both AHI and PPNE increased with increasing dietary
   protein, The contribution of PPNE to AHI varied from 6.1 to 94\%, with
   lesser values for P. setiferus and greater ones for P. duorarum, Also,
   the AHI coefficient (percentage of ingested energy) increased with
   increasing dietary protein. The AHI and PPNE coefficients for the four
   shrimp species ranged from 0.3 to 6.5\% and 0.02 to 5.04\% of ingested
   energy, respectively, These results suggest close relationships among
   protein requirements, the capacity to use dietary proteins as a source
   of energy, and adaptation by different species to different types of
   food, The amount of energy used for production of ammonia is proposed as
   an adequate measure of the part played by dietary proteins in food cost.},

Abstract = {Rabbit ceruloplasmin (Cp) was purified after solid ammonium sulfate

   the protein. The purified Cp was used to prepare antibodies in guinea
   pigs that were used afterwards to determine Cp concentration in normal
   rabbits and in rabbits with an experimentally induced chronic anemia.
   The molecular,weight of rabbit Cp determined by SDS-PAGE was 125,000 and
   a high molecular weight Cp of 200,000 comprising 8\% of the total
   purified protein was also found. An optical density ratio (610 nm/280
   nm) of 0.0475 and a molar extinction coefficient of 7625 were obtained.
   Copper determinations yielded a value of 0.24\% that corresponds to 5
   copper atoms per molecule. The staining of Cp following
   disc-electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels also showed a two band
   pattern.},

Abstract = {The in situ distribution of phosphorus in perichromatin granules (PCGs),
   and in the surrounding nucleoplasm was investigated in rat liver cells
   by means of electron spectroscopic imaging of unstained preparations. A
   2-3 nm fibril containing high concentration of phosphorus was found to
   be the main substructural feature of the PCGs revealed in the maps of
   phosphorus. This fibril is folded within the PCG with no apparent order.
   Fibrils of similar diameter and phosphorus content were also found in
   both the halo surrounding the PCG and dispersed in the nucleoplasm. Some
   of such fibrils are in continuity with those occurring within PCGs.
   Sometimes these fibrils are grouped forming a stalk connecting the PCG
   to chromatin. Some stalked PCGs are U-shaped or kidney-shaped,
   resembling Balbiani ring granules in the process of formation as
   observed in Chironomus salivary gland cell nuclei. The external fibrils
   are interpreted as perichromatin fibrils considered to be precursors of
   PCGs.},

Abstract = {The historical reconstruction of the origins of the Neutral Theory of
   Molecular Evolution (NTME) has been seen purely as an extension of a
   long-held theoretical debate between the classical and balance schools
   of Population Genetics. In this perspective, the NTME is but a different
   interpretation of the then recently published data on high
   intrapopulation genetic variability. In this paper we try to show that
   this thesis is deficient and par tially incorrect. We show that the
   sources for the construction and development of the NTME are more varied
   than this traditional account. We support the Dietrich Historical
   Thesis, which is the view that different Versions of the NTME (Kimura,
   and King and Jukes) show different kinds of experimental and theoretical
   support and coincide in recognizing the importance of the then new
   molecular experimental approach and of its comparative results in
   evolutionary biology. We stress this case to show the limits of the
   traditional approach in history and philosophy of science that
   emphasizes the theoretical activities of scientists and the theoretical
   characterization of disciplines.},

Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Pages = {942-950},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Patches of Primula vulgaris occur across a range of light conditions
   within forests. To understand how light affects the stages of the life
   cycle involved in reproduction and recruitment, several
   fecundity-related variables (flower and capsule production, seed set,
   seed germination and seedling establishment) were studied in eight
   populations across a range of light conditions.
   2. The mean number of seeds per plant varied greatly, from seven to 136,
   and the percentage of seedling establishment varied from 0.4 to 17.2\%.
   These variables, as well as the number of flowers per plant and
   fecundity, were positively correlated with the light conditions.
   3. Primula vulgaris populations establish in newly opened gaps. How this
   species colonizes new clearings was investigated by looking at seed
   survival in the soil and seed removal by potential dispersers, in
   particular rodents and ants.
   4. After 14 months in the greenhouse, only three P. vulgaris seedlings
   were observed germinating from 200 soil samples taken from two
   populations. Germination of retrieved seeds from buried samples was
   generally lower than 10\%. This suggests that only a small number of
   seeds remain viable in the soil for long periods of time.
   5. Seed removal was high in the populations studied (more than 70\% in
   10 days). Rodents harvested a greater proportion of seeds than ants.
   Seed dispersal by ants is known to occur within short distances but
   rodents may be long-distance dispersers, which may be important for the
   long-term persistence of P. vulgaris in a site because it allows seeds
   to reach newly opened gaps.},

Abstract = {With the help of quantum-scattering-theory methods and the approximation
   of the stationary phase, we propose a one-dimensional
   quantum-random-walk (QRW) model, which describes for both tunneling and
   scattering above the potential, the coherent diffusion of independent
   particles described by wave packets in a periodic one-dimensional
   lattice. The QRW model describes for each lattice cell the time
   evolution of modulating amplitudes of two opposite-moving wave packets
   as they are scattered by periodic potential barriers. Since the QRW
   model is a coherent process, interference contributions in the
   probabilities bring about strong departures from classical results. For
   many identical free particles we obtain the theoretical and graphical
   Bose and Fermi two-body QRW probability distribution. The result is
   generalized to N identical free particles and we obtain the N-body Bose
   and Fermi QRW probability distribution.},

Abstract = {We determined the role of the digestive gland in the respiratory
   metabolism of Penaeus setiferus adult males as a step toward proposing a
   feeding schedule based on the cycle of activity in the digestive gland.
   We measured pre- and postprandial values for oxygen consumption rate and
   hemolymph glucose concentrations in live animals, and oxygen consumption
   rate and glycogen concentration in excised digestive gland. After the
   animals were fed, which enhanced general metabolic activity, these
   indices changed. There was a high correlation between the oxygen
   consumption rate of the animal and the glucose concentration in the
   hemolymph, and between the oxygen consumption rate by the digestive
   gland and the glycogen concentration in the digestive gland, all in
   relation to time after feeding. Correlations support the hypothesis that
   the energy demand depends upon the metabolic substrate concentration. In
   this theory, glucose sustains muscle activity (during ingestion of food)
   and glycogen is the product of the digestive gland during food
   assimilation. Our observations of metabolic dynamics during the feeding
   period allowed us to examine the feeding process. The metabolic activity
   of the digestive gland was highest 6 h after feeding. This could mean
   that assimilation, having started 2 h after food intake, peaked 6 h
   after feeding. Eight hours after feeding, the oxygen consumption rate of
   the digestive gland decreased and fell to values similar to those
   recorded for animals subjected to 72 h of fasting.},

Abstract = {A theoretical analysis is given for the high-temperature ignition in a

   responsible for ignition occur in the air side of the mixing layer,
   where the mixture is lean. A simplified reduced mechanism is found to
   describe the ignition process. The radicals OH and H follow the
   steady-state approximation while the radical O is the chain branching
   species following an autocatalytic reaction with moderately large
   activation energy. Numerical results of the governing equations for
   large values of the activation energy are presented and from a
   symplified analysis, we obtain a closed form solution of the ignition

Abstract = {Nitrite accumulation is a serious problem in intensive fish culture.
   Nitrite is an intermediate product in the biological oxidation of
   ammonia to nitrate. An increase in nitrite concentration can be
   attributed to nitrogen excretion by organisms, food excess in ponds or
   disturbances in the nitrifying bacteria population. When disturbances in
   the nitrification process do not surpass the maximum capacities of the
   system, low nitrite levels are attain in short-term periods (Diab and
   Shilo 1988).
   The toxicity of nitrite is partly due to its ability to oxidize
   hemoglobin to methemoglobin; however, this is not the primary cause of
   fish death (Almendras 1987). Nitrite toxicity is modified both by
   abiotic and biotic factors. Temperature has multiple effects in both
   water characteristics and fish physiology; high temperatures increase
   the diffusion rate of molecules, the gill permeability and the metabolic
   rates of fish. Huey et al. (1984) suggest that high temperatures
   increase the nitrite uptake in Ictalurus punctatus and thus the nitrite
   toxicity.
   The relationship between size and nitrite toxicity remains a
   controversial point. Some authors report that smaller fish are more
   tolerant to nitrite than bigger ones (e.g. Almendras 1987). In contrast,
   Wedemeyer and Yasutake (1977) and Hilmy et al. (1987) suggest that the
   large-size fish are less sensitive to the pollutant.
   The capacity to predict the impact of pollutants in aquaculture systems
   is very important to avoid unfavorable effects in yield. Chemical
   toxicity is modified both by abiotic and biotic factors, thus in this
   work we studied the effect of acclimation temperature and fish weight on
   the nitrite median lethal concentration of juvenile Ctenopharyngodon
   idella.},

   Hg-based superconductors are obtained for different values of the ratio

   these materials have the highest transition temperature known for
   layered copper-oxide superconductors, they serve as a new testing ground

Abstract = {Embryogenic cultures were initially friable and yellow, and were
   composed of spherical, vacuolate cells with prominently stained nuclei.
   Binucleate cells occurred in embryogenic cultures but could not be
   directly associated with induction of somatic embryogenesis. None of the
   early stage somatic embryos that formed from the primary cultures
   developed to maturity. Proliferating embryogenic cultures consisted of
   hyperhydric somatic embryos that increased in number by cleavage or
   somatic polyembryogenesis from the embryonic mass. Binucleate cells were
   also temporally present in the embryonic mass during cleavage or somatic
   polyembryogenesis; however, it was impossible to relate the appearance
   of these cells with secondary somatic embryogenesis. Approximately 12-15
   months after the first appearance of precotyledonary somatic embryos,
   the somatic embryos became hard and opaquely white in appearance. The
   embryonic mass of somatic embryos at this time consisted of very small,
   actively dividing cells. Cap cells were not observed at the distal end
   of precotyledonary somatic embryos. Cells of the suspensor were rich in
   starch, elongated and highly vacuolate. Somatic embryos were
   dicotyledonary and densely stained idioblasts were observed in the
   cotyledons. Root initials developed distal to the root cap, The bipolar
   morphology of these somatic embryos was confirmed.},

Abstract = {The origin of the biosynthetic pathways for the branched-chain amino
   acids cannot be understood in terms of the backwards development of the
   present acetolactate pathway because it contains unstable intermediates.
   We propose that the first biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids
   was by the reductive carboxylation of short branched chain fatty acids
   giving keto acids which were then transaminated. Similar reaction
   sequences mediated by nonspecific enzymes would produce serine and
   threonine from the abundant prebiotic compounds glycolic and lactic
   acids. The aromatic amino acids may also have first been synthesized in
   this way, e.g. tryptophan from indole acetic acid. The next step would
   have been the biosynthesis of leucine from alpha-ketoisovaleric acid.
   The acetolactate pathway developed subsequently. The first version of
   the Krebs cycle, which was used for amino acid biosynthesis, would have
   been assembled by making use of the reductive carboxylation and leucine
   biosynthesis enzymes, and completed with the development of a single new
   enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase. This evolutionary scheme suggests that
   there may be limitations to inferring the origins of metabolism by a
   simple back extrapolation of current pathways.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study numerically the steady-state conjugate heat
   transfer process between two counterflowing forced streams separated by
   a wall with finite thermal conductivity. Using the Lighthill
   approximation, the energy equations for both fluids can be written as an
   integral relationship between the temperature and the temperature
   gradient at both interfaces. The energy equation for the solid given by
   the Laplace equation is solved numerically using the above mentioned
   boundary conditions together with those coming from the adiabatic edges.
   Three non-dimensional parameters appear in the problem, alpha, beta and
   epsilon. alpha corresponds to the ratio of the ability of the plate to
   carry heat in the streamwise direction to the ability of the fluid to
   carry out of the plate, beta ist the relationship between the thermal
   boundary layer thicknesses of both fluids and epsilon corresponds to the
   aspect ratio of the plate. The distribution of the temperature of the
   plate as well the overall heat transfer rates have been numerically
   obtained. The influence of the longitudinal heat conduction through the
   wall is very important on the overall heat transfer rates. The maximum
   average Nusselt number occurs for a finite value of alpha, depending
   strongly on beta and epsilon.},

   The spatial and temporal distribution of Skeletonema subsalsum, S.
   pseudocostatum and S. costatum in the lagoon varied with the salinity.
   S. subsalsum was dominant in the rainy season (July-February), when
   salinity was 0-6 ppt. S. coslatum was abundant in the adjacent marine
   zone, occasionally with S. tropicum, and occurred in the lagoon during
   the dry season (March) at salinities of 3.2-37.0 ppt. S. pseudocostatum
   was present the whole year showing a preference for brackish conditions
   (4-25 ppt). Morphological variation in three species was observed by
   light microscopy and studied in detail by electron microscopy. The shape
   of the external tubes of the fultoportulae, considered as an important
   taxonomic character, Varied in S. subsalsum and S. pseudocostatum. We
   observed long threads in S. subsalsum and S. pseudocostatum, associated
   with unicellular or short-chained forms, probably to confer buoyancy. S.
   subsalsum, previously found only north of 40 degrees N, is here reported
   for tropical waters. This is the first record of S, subsalsum and S.

Abstract = {In this paper we study the existence of travelling wave solutions
   (t.w.s.), u(x, t) = phi(x-ct) for the equation
   ({*}) partial derivative u/partial derivative t=partial
   derivative/partial derivative x{[}D(u)partial derivative u/partial
   derivative x]+g(u),
   where the reactive part g(u) is as in the Fisher-KPP equation and
   different assumptions are made on the Mon-linear diffusion term D(u).
   Both functions D and g are defined on the interval {[}0, 1]. The
   existence problem is analysed in the following two cases.
   Case 1. D(0)=0, D(u)>0 For All u is an element of(0, 1], D and g is an
   element of C-{[}0 ,C-1] (2), D'(0)not equal 0 and D `'(0)not equal 0. We
   prove that if there exists a value of c, c{*}, for which the equation
   ({*}) possesses a travelling wave solution of sharp type, it must be
   unique. By using some continuity arguments we show that: for 0<c<c{*},
   there are no t.w.s., while for c>c{*}, the equation ({*}) has a
   continuum of t.w.s. of front type. The proof of uniqueness uses a
   monotonicity property of the solutions of a system of ordinary
   differential equations, which is also proved.
   Case 2. D(0)=D'(0)=0, D and g is an element of C-{[}0,C- 1] (2), D
   `'(0)not equal 0. If, in addition, we impose D `'(0)>0 with D(u)>0 For
   All u is an element of(0, 1], We give sufficient conditions on c for the
   existence of t.w.s. of front type. Meanwhile if D `'(0)<0 with D(u)<0
   For All u is an element of(0, 1] we analyse just one example
   (D(u)=-u(2), and g(u)=u(1-u)) which has oscillatory t.w.s. for 0<c less
   than or equal to 2 and t.w.s. of front type for c>2.
   In both the above cases we use higher order terms in the Taylor series
   and the Centre Manifold Theorem in order to get the local behaviour
   around a non-hyperbolic point of codimension one in the phase plane. (C)

Abstract = {This paper is the first to present a basic feeding schedule for Penaeus
   setiferus larvae based on diatoms (Chaetoceros ceratosporum),
   flagellates (Tetraselmis chuii) and Artemia nauplii. Growth rate (mu
   m/day), rate of metamorphosis and survival of larvae fed 5 different
   concentrations of diatoms, flagellates and Artemia nauplii were
   measured. Survival associated with sudden changes in salinity (quality
   index QI) of the postlarvae harvested from each treatment was measured.
   A performance index was calculated from the growth rate, survival and
   QI. Considering all responses, a feeding schedule for P. setiferus
   larvae is recommended including a progressive increase in the
   concentration of diatoms (between protozoea and mysis; 30 and 40 X 10(3)
   cells/ml, respectively), flagellates (between protozoea and mysis; 2 X
   10(3) cells/ml, respectively) and Artemia nauplii (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5
   between PZ(3)-M(1), M(1)-M(2) and M(2)-M(3), respectively). The increase
   in concentration of algae and Artemia indicates a pattern of development
   of the digestive system associated with development of the larvae. This
   pattern must be considered to improve the production of larvae of this
   species under controlled conditions.},

Abstract = {The present research addresses the question of whether Rubisco activase
   (R-A), the enzyme reported to activate Rubisco, is actually a molecular
   chaperone rather than a conventional enzyme, Several biochemical
   properties known to be characteristics of molecular chaperones were
   tested for R-A with positive results. The experiments were performed
   either in vitro with purified spinach Rubisco and Rubisco activase or in
   vivo in maize seedling leaves. Our results confirmed that activation of
   Rubisco by R-A is an ATP hydrolysis-dependent process and further
   demonstrated that (a) R-A binds preferably to nonnative Rubisco protein,
   than to the native form, and dissociates from this complex after
   addition of ATP, (b) R-A increases during heat shock treatment in maize
   seedling leaves, and (c) a large recovery of Rubisco activity is
   achieved from heat-inactivated Rubisco by addition of R-A and an energy
   source. We conclude that R-A characteristics strongly suggest that this
   protein belongs to the molecular chaperone group. The possible role of
   R-A on maintaining Rubisco activity in vivo is discussed.},

Abstract = {Adaptive characteristics of circadian rhythm are based on their capacity
   to be synchronized by external signals, particularly light signals. The
   effect of both single and periodic light signals on the
   electroretinogram (ERG) circadian rhythm in crayfish is studied. In a
   previous work (Lara-Aparicio er al., Bull. math. Biol. 55, 97-110, 1993)
   we developed a mathematical model simulating the emergence of the ERG
   circadian rhythm during the ontogeny of the crayfish. In the present
   work we have tested the familiar wave-shift behaviour of an oscillator
   with a single limit cycle. Two new facts, not present in a simpler
   model, now appear, which simulate adequately the experimental results,
   i.e. the presence of a transient stage and the shape of the perturbed
   wave which changes according to the characteristics of the external
   light signals.},

Abstract = {Twenty-four nearly complete carapace samples were collected at three
   different localities of the Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) Cardenas
   Formation in San Luis Potosi, east-central Mexico. The material has been
   assigned to five families: the Callianassidae, Dakoticancridae,
   Carcineretidae, ?Majidae, and Retroplumidae. Two genera of callianassid
   shrimp are described, Cheramus for the first time in the fossil record.
   Dakoticancer australis Rathbun is reported as the most abundant
   crustacean element; one new genus and species of carcineretid crab,
   Branchiocarcinus cornatus, is erected, and a single, fragmentary
   specimen is questionably referred to the Majidae. The three localities
   reflect paleoenvironmental differences, exhibited by different
   lithologies, within marginal marine, lagoon environments. The record of
   dakoticancrid crabs in the Cardenas Formation extends the
   paleobiogeographic range of the family and the genus Dakoticancer.
   Carcineretid crabs, although not abundant, seem to have been a
   persistent element of crustacean assemblages in elastic environments
   during the Late Cretaceous of the ancestral Gulf Coast of Mexico.},

Abstract = {Environmental assessments of regional development projects have been
   used in Mexico to determine where conflicts between conservation of
   biodiversity and resource extraction are likely to occur. Species-rich
   areas have been acknowledged as a priority for conservation. However,
   biological information is incomplete and biased toward accessible sites,
   so species-rich areas cannot be depicted directly from current
   biological knowledge.
   An alternative approach to predicting species-rich areas is presented in
   this article. It is based on the gap analysis technique and involves the
   use of ordination analysis and generalized linear models integrated with
   a geographic information system. This approach was used for locating
   species-rich areas in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, where a
   regional forestry development project was proposed. Baseline information
   consisted of gee-referenced collection sites of terrestrial vertebrates.
   Thirty-two species assemblages were identified by the ordination
   analysis, as well as by 25 generalized linear models. Validation of six
   of these models showed no significant differences between observed and
   predicted species frequencies.
   Results demonstrated that species-rich areas could be depicted even
   under the constraints of environmental assessment in Mexico. A large
   number of species could be used in this analysis due to the minimal
   information required for each species record. This predictive approach
   optimized available biological information for the integration of
   conservation into regional development planning.},

Abstract = {An understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of bursting is fundamental in
   unraveling structure-function relations in nerve and secretory tissue.
   Bursting is characterized by alternations between phases of rapid
   spiking and slowly varying potential. A simple phase model is developed
   to study endogenous parabolic bursting, a class of burst activity
   observed experimentally in excitable membrane. The phase model is
   motivated by Rinzel and Lee's dissection of a model for neuronal
   parabolic bursting (J. Math. Biol. 25, 653-675 (1987)). Rapid spiking is
   represented canonically by a one-variable phase equation that is coupled
   bi-directionally to a two-variable slow system, The model is analyzed in
   the slow-variable phase plane? using quasi steady-state assumptions and
   formal averaging, We derive a reduced system to explore where the full
   model exhibits bursting, steady-states, continuous and modulated
   spiking. The relative speed of activation and inactivation of the slow
   variables strongly influences the burst pattern as well as other
   dynamics. We find conditions of the bistability of solutions between
   continuous spiking and bursting. Although the phase model is simple, we
   demonstrate that it captures many dynamical features of more complex
   biophysical models.},

Abstract = {Although the origin of self-sustaining, autoreplicating systems capable
   of undergoing Darwinian evolution is still unknown, a research program
   based on the hypothesis of chemical and precellular evolution has
   provided a framework within which the abiotic synthesis of biochemical
   monomers and membrane components, the experimental study of replicative
   systems, and the interactions between different ribozymes and a
   potentially wide range of substrates including amino acids, can be
   incorporated into a coherent historical narrative of evolutionary
   events. The significance of mathematical models and computer-based
   simulations of autocatalytic cycles based on complexity theory to the
   study of the origin of life will be considerable enhanced when
   experimental evidence supporting them becomes available.},

Abstract = {Savanna gallery forests in Belize and Venezuela support both local tree
   species densities that are comparable to those of continuous tropical
   forests in the region, and floras that are characteristic of these
   forests.  Species coexistence is mediated by a large suite of mechanisms
   including occasional incursions of savanna fires.  A forest-edge
   community fo fire-tolerant trees is important in preserving
   micro-climatic stability of the forest, but appears to be gradually
   destroyed when fires become too frequent.  The existence of these
   long-isolated, but floristically rich, forest patches indicates that the
   loss of plant biodiversity is not an inevitable consequence of forest
   fragmentation.  We suggest that gallery forests could have been an
   important refuge for tropical forest species during Pleistocene aridity,
   and could play a similar role during future periods of human
   deforestation.},

Abstract = {There is convincing paleontological evidence showing that
   stromatolite-building phototactic prokaryotes were already in existence
   3.5 x 10(9) years ago. Late accretion impacts may have killed off life
   on our planet as late as 3.8 x 10(9) years ago. This leaves only 300
   million years to go from the prebiotic soup to the RNA world and to
   cyanobacteria. However, 300 million years should be more than sufficient
   time. All known prebiotic reactions take place in geologically rapid
   time scales, and very slow prebiotic reactions are not feasible because
   the intermediate compounds would have been destroyed due to the passage
   of the entire ocean through deep-sea vents every 10(7) years or in even
   less time. Therefore, it is likely that self-replicating systems capable
   of undergoing Darwinian evolution emerged in a period shorter than the
   destruction rates of its components (<5 million years). The time for
   evolution from the first DNA/protein organisms to cyanobacteria is
   usually thought to be very long. However, the similarities of many
   enzymatic reactions, together with the analysis of the available
   sequence data, suggest that a significant number of the components
   involved in basic biological processes are the result of ancient gene
   duplication events. Assuming that the rate of gene duplication of
   ancient prokaryotes was comparable to today's present values, the
   development of a filamentous cyanobacterial-like genome would require
   approximately 7 x 10(6) years-or perhaps much less. Thus, in spite of
   the many uncertainties involved in the estimates of time for life to
   arise and evolve to cyanobacteria, we see no compelling reason to assume
   that this process, from the beginning of the primitive soup to
   cyanobacteria, took more than 10 million years.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the distribution of U3 snRNA and rRNA in HeLa cells
   and normal rat kidney cells during interphase and mitosis. U3 snRNA,
   known to be involved in pre-rRNA processing, was detected in nucleoli
   and coiled bodies during interphase, whereas rRNA was distributed in the
   nucleoli and throughout the cytoplasm. By comparison, ribosomal protein
   S6 was detected in nucleoli, coiled bodies, and in the cytoplasm. During
   nucleologenesis, pre-rRNA was observed in newly forming nucleoli during
   late telophase but not in prenucleolar bodies (PNBs), whereas U3 snRNA
   was detected in forming nucleoli and PNBs. Similar findings to those
   reported here for the localization of U3 snRNA have been reported
   previously for the U3 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein fibrillarin. These
   results suggest that components involved in pre-rRNA processing localize
   to discrete PNBs at the end of mitosis. The nucleolus is formed at
   specific telophase domains (nucleolar organizing regions) and the PNBs,
   containing factors essential for pre-rRNA processing, are recruited to
   these sites of rRNA transcription and processing.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the p-Frechet-Urysohn property of function
   spaces, for p is-an-element-of beta(omega)\textbackslash{}omega. We
   prove that C(pi)(X) is p-Frechet-Urysohn if and only if X has
   (gamma(p)), where (gamma(p) is the natural p-version of property (gamma)
   (this is a generalization of a result due to Gerlits and Nagy). We note
   the following implications: X is second countable double arrow pointing
   right X has (gamma(p)) for some p is-an-element-of
   beta(omega)\textbackslash{}omega double line arrow pointing right X(n)
   is Lindelof for all 1 less-than-or-equal-to n < omega. We deal with the
   question when is C(pi)(R) a p-Frechet-Urysohn space. It is shown that
   there is p is-an-element-of beta(omega)\textbackslash{}omega such that
   C(pi)(R) is p-Frechet-Urysohn; if p is semiselective, then every subset
   X of R satisfying (gamma(p)) has measure zero and if p is selective,
   then X is a strong measure zero set; and we can find p is-an-element-of
   beta(omega)\textbackslash{}omega such that C(pi)(R) is p-Frechet-Urysohn
   and is not strongly p-Frechet-Urysohn. Finally, we prove that R(omega)
   does not have (gamma(p)) whenever p is a P-point of
   beta(omega)\textbackslash{}omega.},

   In contrast, the epithelia of posterior part of the midgut tube and of
   the stercoral pocket consist of one type of cells only. In some places,
   parts of the midgut system are connected by an intermediate tissue.
   Digestive cells are characterized by an apical system of tubules,
   nutritional vacuoles, and spherites; characteristic features of
   secretory cells are secretory granules and a prominent rough endoplasmic
   reticulum. Cells of the midgut tube appear not to be involved in the

Abstract = {The Upper Cenozoic flora of the Pie de Vaca Formation, Puebla, Mexico,
   is yielding important elements that contribute to a more complete
   knowledge of the Tertiary floras of southern latitudes of North America.
   Among the most abundant plant organs in this Formation are fruits of
   Cedrelospermum, an extinct ulmaceous genus belonging to the subfamily
   Ulmoideae. The Cedrelospermum fruits are morphologically described and
   fruit structure is interpreted. A single specimen with preserved cells
   allowed some histological description. The fruits from the Pie de Vaca
   Formation are compared directly to fruits of Cedrelospermum species from
   mid-latitude North America and Europe. Differences equivalent to those
   between North American species are found between the fruits of Pie de
   Vaca and the most similar species, justifying the recognition of a new
   species, Cedrelospermum manchesteri Magallon-Puebla et Cevallos-Ferriz.
   Detached leaves from the same strata that conform morphologically to
   leaves of previously known species of Cedrelospermum are described and
   compared to leaves of Cedrelospermum and to an equivalent genus from
   Europe. Although it is quite likely that these leaves formed part of the
   same plants that produced the Cedrelospermum manchesteri fruits, they
   are assigned to a separate taxon, Magdalenophyllum aequilaterum
   Magallon-Puebla et Cevallos-Ferriz, because the two organs are not found
   in organic connection. The genus Cedrelospermum was previously known
   from North American middle Eocene-lower Oligocene strata and European
   Eocene-upper Miocene strata. This new report documents the persistence
   of the genus in southern latitudes of North America during the Neogene,
   and the fruit features conform to previously observed patterns of
   morphological change through time in the genus. The occurrence of C.
   manchesteri in a volcanic ash deposit supports the assumed role of
   Cedrelospermum plants as re-colonizers of areas disturbed by volcanic
   activity.},

   understanding of the mechanisms that enable closely related species to
   exploit the same trophic niche. Callinectes sapidus, C. rathbunae, and
   C. similis from Tamiahua Lagoon, Mexico, were used in the present study
   to investigate this question. A total of 4,038 crab-gut contents were
   analyzed. Of these 1,350 belonged to C sapidus, 1,128 to C rathbunae,
   and 1,560 to C similis. Six groups of food items were identified: plant
   fragments (Halodule spp.), micromolluscs (Mulinia lateralis and Macoma
   atenta, crustaceans (Penaeus spp. and Callinectes spp.), animal
   residues, and sand and mud. A seasonal variation in prey composition was
   observed, as well as differences among ages of the three species. In
   general, as the size class increased, plant matter, sediment, and animal
   residues decreased, and micromolluscs and crustaceans increased. A clear
   overlap was detected for C sapidus-C. rathbunae of their trophic niches,
   with a maximum overlap in winter when both species ate practically the
   same type of food. The same pattern was observed also for C sapidus-C.
   similis. Callinectes similis-C rathbunae show overlap in spring and
   winter, when ovigerous females are on their breeding grounds.
   Ontogenetic changes in the diet and niche overlap in relation to
   seasonal changes in reproductive behavior allow the three species to
   utilize the same resources at Tamiahua Lagoon, Mexico.},

   secondary spermatocytes occur in the spring and summer, respectively.
   During late summer and early fall the spermiogenesis takes place; the
   previous pattern defines a seasonal fall reproductive cycle, and the
   recrudescence is probably due to adaptative pressures controled by the
   neuroendocrine system. Populations reproduce in spring-summer or
   summer-fall. This results will help to understand the mechanism that
   regulates the fall reproductive season of temperate species inhabiting
   zones with tropical influence.},

Abstract = {The genetic structure of Rhizobium etli biovar phaseoli was determined
   for five populations in three different locations in the state of
   Morelos, Mexico, by using starch gel electrophoresis for five to nine
   polymorphic loci. Two populations were sampled during two different
   years from nodules of cultivated and wild common bean plants (Phaseolus
   vulgaris). The three other populations were associated with wild runner
   beans (P. coccineus) and sampled during 1988. The Rhizobium populations
   differ genetically both among sites and among populations within the
   same site in different years, as shown by differences in allelic
   frequencies, genetic differentiation analysis, and differences in
   electrotypes. The total genetic diversity for the five populations
   during 1988 was H = 0.487; there were also high levels of genetic
   variation within each population. We found the highest linkage
   disequilibrium in a global analysis for all the populations. At a local
   scale, we also found significant linkage disequilibrium in two
   populations, although the distribution of the D' suggest some
   recombination at a local scale. The other three rhizobium populations
   exhibit low linkage disequilibrium. A cluster analysis (UPGMA) of
   pairwise genetic distances showed that bacteria isolated from most wild
   Phaseolus spp. are grouped by population, whereas those obtained from
   cultivated P. vulgaris are very heterogeneous. The analysis of the
   genetic structure of Rhizobium strains may allow the identification of
   strains that are naturally well adapted to a wide range of different
   environments, which may be useful for agricultural purposes or as a
   starting point for developing improved Rhizobium strains.},

Abstract = {Here we report the results of an uvby-beta and JHKLM photometric study
   of 25 stars in the field direction of the open cluster NGC 7380, and of
   an Halpha interferometric/photographic direct imagery study of the HII
   and its associated molecular cloud regions Sh2-142 and NGC 7380 E,
   respectively. The photometric study yielded the following: a) Teff and
   log g estimates of the program stars, (b) a normal reddening law and
   uniform extinction towards the region with A(upsilon)/E(B - V) = 3.1 +/-
   0.1 and A(upsilon) = 2.0m +/- 0.1m, respectively, (c) the result that 16
   of the 25 stars observed photometrically are cluster members and the
   remaining 9 are field stars, (d) and that only 4 of the 16 cluster
   members studied here have spectral types later than B1, and (e) similar
   distance estimates to NGC 7380 by three distinct methods with d = 3.2
   +/- 0.2 Kpc as its recommended value. From the Halpha interferometric
   imagery of Sh2-142 we find the following: (f) the distribution of the
   1100 individual radial velocity points conforming the velocity field of
   the HII region follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean (LSR) radial
   velocity of -40.3 +/- 0.2 km s-1 and a velocity dispersion of 1sigma =
   5.1 km s-1, (g) a kinematic distance estimate of d(k) = 3.3 +/- 0.2 Kpc,
   and (h) a lack of confirmation of the velocity gradient of about 30 km
   s-1 in the east-west direction of the nebula and the velocity dispersion
   of 12.5 kin s-1 observed with similar techniques by others. The
   photographic imagery of Sh2-142 in the Halpha lambda 6563 angstrom,
   {[}NII]lambda 6584 angstrom and {[}SII]lambdalambda 6717/6731 angstrom
   lines reveal (i) the peculiar structure of the nebula composed by
   several bright arcuated clouds, rims and Halpha knots interlaced with
   local dust lanes, (j) a resemblance between the Halpha image and thermal
   21 cm radio continuum map in form and size, and (k) the bright knot of
   about 0.4 pc in diameter is being excited at least partially by the 08V
   star LSIII 57-degrees-89 (nr. 16 here). The current model for the
   HII/HI/H-2 cloud complex is briefly discussed in the context of our
   observations.},

Abstract = {One mycotoxin and three therapeutic drugs widely used in developing
   countries were examined for genotoxic activity by means of w/w + somatic
   recombination assay. Streptozotocin (SZ), an antibiotic antineoplastic
   agent, gave a frequency of light spots almost one order of magnitude
   higher than those obtained with the carcinogen mycotoxin
   sterigmatocystin (STC), the antiprotozoal and antimicrobial
   metronidazole (MNZ), and the antifungal griseofulvin (GF). Thus the
   order of response was SZ>STC>MNZ>GF. Chronic treatment turned out to be
   the better route of exposure for these genotoxins when compared with
   surface treatment. The performance of the insecticide-resistant strain
   Hikone-R was better than that of the wild genotype LS (Leiden Standard).
   The positive test results obtained with all four chemicals showed that
   the P450 system of Drosophila is capable of metabolizing these
   genotoxins into electrophilic intermediates.},

Abstract = {In this article the steady-state process leading to ignition of a
   combustible mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen by a hot flat
   plate in a boundary layer flow is studied, including the effect of
   thermal diffusion. For sufficiently large values of the plate
   temperature, the ignition event corresponds to a typical chain-branching
   explosion with negligible heat release, in a first approximation. In the
   framework of the reduced kinetic mechanism appropriate for this regime,
   the boundary layer equations are solved by using the fact that the chain
   branching reaction H + O2 --> OH + O has a relatively large activation
   energy. Assuming a three-layer structure, the governing equations reduce
   to a single integrodifferential equation for the concentration of atomic
   hydrogen. Close to the plate leading edge, the concentration of atomic
   hydrogen around the plate surface is higher when thermal diffusion is
   included, but, later on, this effect enhances the evacuation of atomic
   hydrogen by the external convective/diffusive layer. Thus, in spite of
   the initial enrichment in molecular hydrogen by thermal diffusion, the
   final ignition distance is shown to be enlarged by a factor of about 2,
   under usual conditions. On the other hand, for low plate temperature
   ignition, thermal diffusion produces the expected reduction in the
   ignition distance.},

Abstract = {Generalized thermohydrodynamics is used to provide for a basis to
   compute transport coefficients of a binary isothermal solution
   consisting of a viscoelastic fluid in a viscous solvent. A description
   is made of the states of this system using, besides the conventional
   conserved densities, a set of non-conserved variables provided by the
   stress tensor and the mass flux of one of the components. Within a
   linearized scheme, the solution to the evolution equations obeyed by the
   latter ones provides a set of constitutive equations which are in
   general both wave vector and frequency dependent. When the constitutive
   equations are substituted into the conservation equations, a complete
   set is obtained from which all relevant quantities may be computed.
   These involve wave vector and frequency dependent expressions for the
   transport coefficients as well as the dynamic structure factor which may
   be obtained by light or neutron scattering. These results are analyzed
   and compared with other ones existing in the literature.},

Abstract = {The most frequently invoked explanation for the origin of metabolic
   pathways is the retrograde evolution hypothesis. In contrast, according
   to the so-called `'patchwork'' theory, metabolism evolved by the
   recruitment of relatively inefficient small enzymes of broad specificity
   that could react with a wide range of chemically related substrates. In
   this paper it is argued that both sequence comparisons and experimental
   results on enzyme substrate specificity support the patchwork assembly
   theory. The available evidence supports previous suggestions that gene
   duplication events followed by a gradual neoDarwinian accumulation of
   mutations and other minute genetic changes lead to the narrowing and
   modification of enzyme function in at least some primordial metabolic
   pathways.},

   studied with a potential that includes polarization and nonadditive
   effects in the intermolecular interaction. Very long runs, 20 X 10(6)

   obtained reproduce experimental data, in particular the nitrogen and
   hydrogen centered radial distribution functions, validating the model
   and also allowing for the assignment of the structure of this function.
   We can also address the phenomena of the dimerization of urea and the
   urea water correlation. Energetic and structural analysis show that
   there is a urea network which has a particular effect on water
   structure.},

Abstract = {Using electron spectroscopic imaging, a new type of small granular
   structural constituent has been observed in the extrachromosomal zone of
   the polytene nucleus of the salivary gland cells of Chironomus thummi
   and Chironomus tentans. These granules appear isolated or in small
   clumps and are often seen to be connected with surrounding thin fibrils.
   They are stained by the EDTA procedure, which is preferential for
   nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) constituents, and by the bismuth
   oxynitrate method for visualizing phosphorylated compounds. The granules
   are 15-23 nm in diameter and are digested by prolonged post-embedding
   RNAse hydrolysis. These structural elements contain the highest
   concentration of phosphorus in the interchromosomal space as revealed by
   electron energy loss spectroscopy. The small granules exhibit several
   morphological and cytochemical features in common with interchromatin
   granules, but they are not labeled with antibodies directed against
   extranucleolar small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), as are interchromatin
   granules.},

Abstract = {In this paper the linear stability of a fluid layer flowing down the
   inside and outside of a rotating vertical cylinder is investigated. To
   this end, two approximations are made: the small wave number
   approximation and the small Reynolds number approximation. In the
   former, only the radial destabilizing effect of surface tension is
   important and may be counteracted by the centrifugal force at a critical
   value. In the latter, the analysis integrates the azimuthal modes
   different from m=0. It is shown that for flow outside the cylinder, the
   magnitude of centrifugal force and wave number may change the dominant
   mode of instability. For flow inside the cylinder, only the mode m=0 may
   be unstable. These results generalize those of Boudourides and Davis
   {[}Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 37, 597 (1986)] for swirling viscous flows.},

   specimen consists of an open exoperidium with ten triangular rays, and a
   central, circular endoperidium with an eccentrical ostiole and irregular
   surface relief. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a delicate
   reticulum on the surface of rays and on samples of the endoperidium. An
   acetolyzed fragment of the endoperidium yielded a few fungal spores, and
   similar spores were also obtained from an acetolyzed rock fragment
   adjacent to the fossil specimen. The fossil fungus exhibits the
   characteristics of extant earthstars, morphological comparison between
   the extant and the fossil earthstar and the type of spores obtained from
   the endoperidium of the latter indicate its affinity with Geastrum,
   although uncertainty in diagnostic characters preclude its assignment to
   a living species. The report of a complete basidiocarp of Geastrum from

Abstract = {In Ref. {[}21] the evolution of ensembles of states for dynamical
   systems (DS) With states in a probability space is studied. Enlarging
   some results in Ref. {[}21] to a very common measure spaces the above
   study is generalized for DSs with states in those measure spaces. This
   enlargement uncovers an indecomposability subregion (AA) of the space of
   states, for which each orbit of states of the system has all its states
   in AA from some time on. It is obtained that each ensemble of states, in
   its natural evolution, evolves in ergodic sense (convergence a la weak
   Cesaro) to the microcanonical ensemble (scattered by all AA). A

Abstract = {The minimum energy arrangements of atoms adsorbed on a crystalline
   surface display a very rich set of geometries originated from the
   competition between the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction, and the
   tendency to occupy the most favorable adsorption sites over the
   substrate. We develop a method to obtain these geometries for rational
   coverages assuming the adsorbates occupy symmetric sites and that they
   form a lattice commensurate with the substrate, allowing for
   multi-atomic primitive cells. We obtain results for adsorption on a
   square lattice with truncated-dipolar interactions. We propose a new
   truncation scheme which we compare with previous ones, and we explore
   the effects of changing the range of the potential. The ordered phases
   we obtain agree with experiments performed for K over Ir(001) and Cs
   over Rh(001). Furthermore, our results supply some insight on the
   absence of observed ordered phases for some rational coverages.},

Abstract = {The relationships between Anastrepha species and their host plants are
   recorded and analyzed from a study carried out in a natural tropical
   community of Mexico (Estacion de Biologia Tropical Los Tuxtlas,

   forest and found the following associations: Tapirira mexicana Marchand
   was infested with A. sp. and A. obliqua (Macquart); Spondias radlkoferi
   J. D. Smith with A. obliqua; Tabernaemontana alba Mill. with A. cordata
   Aldrich; Quararibea funebris (Llave) Vischer with A. crebra Stone; Inga
   sapindoides Willd. with A. distincta Greene; Brosimum alicastrum Sw. and
   Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria J. D. Smith with A. bahiensis Costa Lima;
   Psidium guajava L. with A. striata Schiner and A. fraterculus

   ludens (Loew); Chrysophyllum mexicanum Brandegee ex Standley, Pouteria

   Hendel and A. minuta Stone, whose hosts in the Los Tuxtlas region are
   still unknown.
   We sampled infestation rates in 10 of the 13 host plants. Of the 3704
   fruits examined, 23.1\% were infested. We encountered 2290 larvae, of
   which 1600 pupated. Parasitoids or adult flies emerged from 85\% of
   these. Infestation percentages of the different fruit species were
   highly variable, ranging from 1. 5\% for P. oxyphyllaria to 66.7\% for
   Pouteria sapota. The mean number of larvae per fruit usually was between
   1.25 and 2.59, and in only the largest and heaviest fruits (such as C.
   aurantium, P. sapota and P. sp.) were there more than 9.0 larvae
   present. Some fruit characteristics affecting the degree of infestation
   are discussed, and the possible existence of a diapause period in some
   Anastrepha species is noted.},

Title = {COMPARATIVE PLANT DEMOGRAPHY - RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF LIFE-CYCLE
   COMPONENTS TO THE FINITE RATE OF INCREASE IN WOODY AND HERBACEOUS
   PERENNIALS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Pages = {465-476},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1 Stage projection (Lefkovitch) matrices for 21 species of woody plants
   and 45 herbaceous perennials were extracted from the plant demographic
   literature or compiled from published data.
   2 Each matrix was divided into six regions representing: 1, recruitment
   of seeds to the seed pool; 2, recruitment of seedlings or juveniles from
   current seed production; 3, clonal growth; 4, retrogression, due to
   plants decreasing in size or reverting in stage; 5, stasis, (survival
   from one year to the next in the same stage class); 6, progression to
   later stage classes.
   3 Matrix analysis was used to calculate the finite rate of increase
   lambda for each population and to calculate the elasticities of each
   transition coefficient in the matrices. Elasticities were summed within
   each of the six regions of the matrix to give measures (E1 - E6,
   respectively) of the importance of each component of the life cycle to
   lambda and fitness.
   4 Herbs as a group differed significantly from woody plants in most of
   these components. Seedling recruitment was more important in herbs than
   woody plants. Retrogression occurred only in herbs, particularly those
   with a tuber. Stasis occurred in nearly all species, but was most
   important in woody plants. Progression was more important than fecundity
   in almost all species.
   5 Trade-offs among life cycle components were determined from
   correlation matrices of r (= In lambda) and elasticities E1 - E6 for the
   whole sample and for herbs and woody plants separately. As a whole, r
   was positively correlated with elasticities for fecundity (E1 + E2) and
   growth (E3 + E6) and negatively correlated with survival (E4 + E5). In
   clonal herbs, fecundity and clonal growth were negatively correlated.
   6 The division of elasticities into three major components (growth, G =
   E3 + E6; fecundity, F = E1 + E2; and survival, L = E4 + E5) allowed us
   to construct triangular plots in G-L-F space. This was done separately
   for iteroparous forest herbs, iteroparous herbs from open habitats,
   semelparous herbs and woody plants. Each of these four groups occupied a
   distinct position in G-L-F space. Within woody plants, shrubs of
   fire-prone habitats occupied the end of the distribution with the lowest
   survival elasticity.
   7 It is argued that the demographic approach to the classification of
   distinct ecological groups offers new insights into the relationship
   between life history and habitat.},

Abstract = {We go further with the analysis of Kaup's equation of motion for
   extended charges, including radiation reaction, begun by Franca et al.
   We offer two series expansions which incorporate properly the time delay
   condition t' = t -- R(t')/c and allow to show the non-linear terms
   mentioned by Franca et al., clarifying the meaning of the usual
   approximations done and giving an alternative derivation of the
   Lorentz-Dirac equation. Our work offers a unified version of several
   studies of the dynamics of extended charges and gives arguments to
   establish that the general non-linear integro-differential equation of
   Kaup must have a causal behaviour. The difficulties to make the point
   charge limit found previously by Teitelboim are also exhibited.},

Abstract = {The quantum random walk (QRW) is a new microscopic model for diffusion
   in a one-dimensional lattice. In order to test its reliability we use
   the QRW mathematical model to solve the lattice equivalent of the well
   known perfect-absorbent shutter problem. The QRW is by construction a
   causal theory; therefore even though our solution lacks for times less
   than x/v the non-causal behavior, which is characteristic of an exact
   Moshinsky `'diffraction in time'' solution, our QRW-derived solution
   shows for times greater than x/v a damped-oscillatory behavior which
   resembles the causal Moshinsky solution. Therefore at least for the
   shutter problem, the oscillatory transient behavior is well approximated
   by the QRW theory. This gives a confidence test on the model.},

Abstract = {The tropical rain forest landscape has been transformed to a mosaic
   composed of patches of crops, secondary vegetation and remnant forest
   fragments of different shapes and sizes. Isolation of patches and
   fragments is a critical issue in the maintenance of local species
   diversity. In this study we focus on the dispersal of propagules by
   birds to understand the movement of plants between landscape components.
   Seed deposition and the behavior of frugivorous birds were monitored at
   four isolated fig trees (Ficus yoponensis and F. aurea) in man-made
   pastures. Seed deposition was measured by trapping seeds under canopy
   trees for six months and by direct observation of bird visits to the
   four trees for one year. Seed deposition densities were 465, 614, 632
   and 1097 seedS/M2     accumulated over six months under each of the four
   trees. We recorded 8268 seeds of 107 species under the trees, among
   them, 6726 seeds (81\%) were of 56 species dispersed by vertebrate
   frugivores. Seeds of tree species accounted for 26\% of the total
   species. Seventy-three species of birds perched in the observed trees,
   and 3344 visits were made by 47 species of frugivores. Frugivorous birds
   occurred in two groups: resident species nesting in the pastures and
   resident species nesting elsewhere. Propagule exchange between landscape
   components is clearly influenced by the behavior of these two groups.
   Structure and dynamics of the landscape depend on plant species
   availability within the mosaic. This availability is high and suggests
   possibilities for the management of the local species diversity of
   tropical rain forests.},

Abstract = {A theory is proposed to describe two-dimensional avalanches in granular
   materials. The theoretical framework is based on a set of experiments in
   which avalanches are generated intermittently by means of a rotating
   drum. From measurements of the instantaneous average angle of the free
   surface, alpha(t), the relevant quantities that characterize avalanches,
   such as critical angles and times, are found to be given by
   distributions. It is then shown that alpha(t) is a stochastic Markov
   process. Consequently, a master equation is constructed for P(alpha, t),
   the conditional probability that the slope is alpha, at time t, given an
   initial state. Finally, a consistency test is carried out, finding full
   agreement with the experimental data.},

Title = {COMPARISON BETWEEN LUNG PARENCHYMA AND BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE
   COLLAGENOLYTIC ACTIVITY},

Abstract = {We have evaluated, in an experimental model of silicosis in guinea pigs,
   if the presence of collagenolytic activity in bronchoalveolar lavage
   (BAL) fluid reflects the collagen catabolism in lung parenchyma. We
   measured simultaneously BAL collagenase activity, using as substrate
   {[}H-3]type I collagen, and lung collagenolytic activity by the tissue
   pellet assay. Animals (n = 30) were instilled intratracheally with 50 mg
   of quartz DQ-12 and sacrificed 15, 30, and 60 days after silica
   administration. Guinea pigs instilled with saline solution were used as
   controls. Our results showed that lung parenchymal collagenolytic
   activity was present in all experimental and normal guinea pigs. There
   were no statistical differences between silicotic and normal animals at
   15 and 30 days. At 60 days, however, a significant decrease in tissue
   collagenolytic activity was observed in silicotic animals (161 +/- 100
   vs. 400 +/- 152 units of collagenase activity; p < 0.001). In contrast,
   BAL collagenolytic activity was revealed only in 7 of 10 silicotic
   animals at 15 days and 30 days, and in 4 of 10 at 60 days. Normal guinea
   pigs did not exhibit BAL collagenase activity. BAL and tissue
   collagenase activity from each experimental animal were analyzed by
   straight line regression and no significant relationship was observed (r
   = 0.082; p = 0.87). This suggests that BAL collagenolytic activity does
   not reflect lung tissue collagen turnover.},

   coloration characters on 1,531 study skins from across the species'
   geographic range. Dividing the specimens examined into 25 population
   samples, I found highly significant geographic differences in most of
   the characters analyzed, including clinal patterns and discrete
   differences in both morphometric and plumage characters. Patterns of
   geographic differentiation in the two character sets were not
   significantly concordant. It is possible to identify seven geographic
   units within the species, each of which is diagnosable based on
   combinations of discrete and continuous character states.},

Abstract = {Documented the fragmentation of the habitat of the volcano rabbit
   (Romerolagus diazi). Two different processes of fragmentation are
   illustrated, namely; man-made and ecological. Man-made fragmentation has
   occurred through splitting the original distribution range into islands
   by highway construction, farming, and intensive burning and grazing
   activities. The ecological fragmentation is due to environmental
   discontinuity, which is reflected in a mosaic of vegetational
   communities or habitats. The ecological amplitude of the habitat types
   has been analyzed by canonical correlation analysis. Six habitat types
   were distinguished. Habitat type 2, open pine woodland (Pinus
   hartwegii-Festuca tolucensis) habitat type 3 mixed alder pine forest
   (Alnus firmifolia-Muhlenbergia macroura) and habitat type 4, pine forest
   (Pinus spp. Muhlenbergia quadridentata) provide most of the suitable
   ecological conditions for the survival of the volcano rabbit.  The two
   processes of fragmentation habitat are threatening the survival of this
   endangered Mexican lagomorph. These two habitat fragmentation processes
   are discussed in light of their role in conservation and management.},

Abstract = {The flower of Lacandonia schismatica is bisexual. Three or sometimes
   four bilocular or trilocular anthers occupy the center of the flower
   inside the zone of carpels. The anther wall comprises four layers:
   epidermis; endothecium whose cells develop helical wall thickenings; one
   middle layer, which disappears early; a tapetum of the secretory type.
   The tapetal cells apparently form cytoplasmic bridges among themselves.
   The microspore tetrads are in an isobilateral arrangement, surrounded by
   a thick wall. The mature anther wall has only two cell layers: epidermis
   and endothecium. The pollen grain is three-celled by the time
   germination occurs. Anther dehiscence has not been observed and probably
   does not occur.
   Pollination of Lacandonia schismatica occurs in the unopened flower bud.
   The pollen grains germinate within the anthers, which do not dehisce,
   and the pollen tubes grow within the receptacle until they reach the
   ovules. The pollen tube enters the embryo sac through the micropyle and
   one synergid, and fertilization is completed by anthesis. This
   reproductive pattern conforms to Lord's definition of preanthesis
   cleistogamy.},

Abstract = {Based on the BCS Hamiltonian, the normal-to-super phase transition is
   investigated, approaching the critical temperature T(c) from the high
   temperature side. Non-zero momentum Cooper pairs, that is, pairs of
   electrons (holes) with antiparallel spins and nearly opposite momenta
   above T(c) in the bulk limit, are shown to move like free bosons with
   the energy (epsilon)-momentum (p) relation epsilon = 1/2nu(F)p, where
   nu(F) represents the Fermi velocity. The system of free Cooper pairs
   undergoes a phase transition of the second order at the critical
   temperature T(c) given by k(B)T(c) = 1.00856HBARnu(F)n1/3, where n is
   the number density of Cooper pairs. The ratio of the jump of the heat
   capacity, DELTAC, to the maximum heat capacity, C(s), is a universal
   constant: DELTAC/C(s) = 0.60874; this number is close to the universal

Abstract = {Reverse transcriptase (RT) was first discovered as an essential catalyst
   in the biological cycle of retroviruses. However, in the past years
   evidence has accumulated showing that RTs are involved in a surprisingly
   large number of RNA-mediated transpositional events that include both
   viral and nonviral genetic entities. Although it is probable that some
   RT-bearing genetic elements like the different types of AIDS viruses and
   the mammalian LINE family have arisen in recent geological times, the
   possibility that reverse transcription first took place in the early
   Archean is supported by (1) the hypothesis that RNA preceded DNA as
   cellular genetic material; (2) the existence of homologous regions of
   the subunit tau of the E. coli DNA polymerase III with the simian
   immunodeficiency virus RT, the hepatitis B virus RT, and the beta'
   subunit of the E. coli RNA polymerase (McHenry et al. 1988); (3) the
   presence of several conserved motifs, including a 14-amino-acid segment
   that consists of an Asp-Asp pair flanked by hydrophobic amino acids,
   which are found in all RTs and in most cellular and viral RNA
   polymerases. However, whether extant RTs descend from the primitive
   polymerase involved in the RNA-to-DNA transition remains unproven.
   Substrate specificity of the AMV and HIV-1 RTs can be modified in the
   presence of Mn2+, a cation which allows them to add ribonucleotides to
   an oligo (dG) primer in a template-dependent reaction. This change in
   specificity is comparable to that observed under similar conditions in
   other nucleic acid polymerases. This experimentally induced change in RT
   substrate specificity may explain previous observations on the
   misincorporation of ribonucleotides by the Maloney murine sarcoma virus
   RT in the minus and plus DNA of this retrovirus (Chen and Temin 1980).
   Our results also suggest that HIV-infected macrophages and T-cell cells
   may contain mixed polynucleotides containing both ribo- and
   deoxyribonucleotides. The evolutionary significance of these changes in
   substrate specificities of nucleic acid polymerases is also discussed.},

Abstract = {The Mr 90000 heat shock protein (hsp 90) and one of the Mr 70000 heat
   shock cognate proteins (hsc 70) were localized by immunoelectron
   microscopy in salivary gland cells of normal and heat-shocked larvae of
   Chironomus thummi using polyclonal antibodies raised against Drosophila
   proteins. Immunoblotting after separation of proteins by gel
   electrophoresis shows that these antibodies cross-react with the
   corresponding proteins of Chironomus. Hsp 90 was localized both in the
   cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it is associated with
   intrachromosomal and extrachromosomal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibrils,
   as well as with the peripheral region of compact chromatin. After heat
   shock the concentration of hsp 90 increases in the nucleus. This
   increase is prevented by actinomycin D administration during the heat
   shock. Hsp 90 is associated with the chromatin of puffs repressed by
   heat shock and with the RNP fibrils of actively transcribing heat shock
   puffs. Hsc 70 is mainly found in RNP fibrils and in the periphery of
   compact chromatin. During heat shock the concentration of hsc 70
   decreases in the cytoplasm while it becomes more abundant in association
   with chromatin and intrachromosomal and extrachromosomal RNP fibrils.
   These results suggest a translocation of the existing protein from the
   cytoplasm toward the nucleus. They are supported by observations of the
   effect of heat shock carried out in the presence of actinomycin D.},

Abstract = {With the help of quantum-scattering-theory methods and the approximation
   of stationary phase, a one-dimensional coherent random-walk model which
   describes both tunneling and scattering above the potential diffusion of
   particles in a periodic one-dimensional lattice is proposed. The walk
   describes for each lattice cell, the time evolution of modulating
   amplitudes of two opposite-moving Gaussian wave packets as they are
   scattered by the potential barriers. Since we have a coherent process,
   interference contributions in the probabilities bring about strong
   departures from classical results. In the near-equilibrium limit, Fick's
   law and its associated Landauer diffusion coefficient are obtained as
   the incoherent contribution to the quantum current density along with a
   novel coherent contribution which depends on the lattice properties as

Title = {PRODUCTION OF COLLAGENASE AND TISSUE INHIBITOR OF METALLOPROTEINASES BY
   FIBROBLASTS DERIVED FROM NORMAL AND FIBROTIC HUMAN LUNGS},

Abstract = {Several experiments have demonstrated low collagenolytic activity during
   the development of pulmonary fibrosis. In order to determine if
   fibroblasts play a role in this alteration, procollagenase and tissue
   inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) were quantified in fibroblasts
   derived from 12 human lung specimens (normal = 6, idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis {[}IPF] = 6). Under basal conditions, three cell strains from
   normal and three from fibrotic lung specimens did not synthesize
   collagenase and a similar number of normal and IPF-derived fibroblast
   strains produced the enzyme. However, the rate of enzyme synthesis among
   normal and fibrotic collagenase producing fibroblasts exhibited
   significant differences. Thus, whereas normal fibroblasts produced more
   than 300 ng/ml, fibrotic lung fibroblasts secreted approximately half of
   this amount (115+/-67 ng/ml). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) enhanced
   collagenase production in all of the 12 lung fibroblast lines tested. In
   four IPF fibroblasts, PMA increased collagenase secretion close to those
   of normal stimulated lung fibroblasts; however, a lower induction was
   observed in cell strains from two fibrotic lung specimens. There was a
   wide variation in TIMP production both in normal and fibrotic lung
   fibroblasts, and no statistically significant difference was observed.
   Under basal conditions, TIMP levels ranged from 329 to 16,911 ng/ml in
   normal lung cells, and from 377 to 17,557 in fibrotic lung fibroblasts.
   PMA induced a several-fold increase in all cell lines. These results
   suggest that there are subpopulations of lung fibroblasts with different
   potential to produce collagenase and TIMP in vitro, and that the
   predominance of low collagenase-producing subsets may contribute to the
   development of fibrosis.},

Abstract = {Incubation temperature has been shown to control sex determination (TSD)
   in both suborders of living turtles, including freshwater, terrestrial,
   and sea turtles. This study combines field and laboratory data from four
   neotropical endemic species (Dermatemys mawii, Staurotypus triporcatus,
   Claudius angustatus, and Kinosternon leucostomum) and two of temperate
   zone origin (Chelydra serpentina and Trachemys scripta). The sex of
   hatchlings incubated in natural nests and controlled laboratory
   temperatures was studied. Adult sex ratios in natural populations were
   determined by mark and recapture studies. Staurotypus and Claudius
   appear to have genetic sex determination (GSD) while TSD occurred in the
   other four species. Threshold temperatures of both Trachemys and
   Chelydra were lower in these Neotropical populations than in those
   studied in Temperate Zone climates. Natural populations of species with
   TSD were found to have variable adult sex ratios, skewed towards one sex
   or the other. These variations in sex ratio could sometimes be explained
   by nest site ecology.},

   two approximations: the small wave-number approximation and the small
   Reynolds number approximation. For the small wave-number approximation,
   it is shown that the Coriolis force not only may decrease the growth
   rate of the instability, but it may stabilize the flow for all angles of
   propagation of the perturbation. For the small Reynolds and Taylor
   numbers and small angle of inclination, it is shown that an increase in

Abstract = {The levels of ceruloplasmin (Cp) and total protein were measured in

   20 days after a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside (PAN).
   Control values for Cp in serum and urine were: 0.23 +/- 0.01 mg/ml and
   0.063 mg/day, and those for total protein were: 7.1 +/- 0.14 g/dl and
   2.1 +/- 0.6 mg/day, respectively. It was found that: a) serum Cp
   decreased on day 6, remained low until day 10 (0.07 +/- 0.01 to 0.08 +/-
   0.01 mg/ml), and returned to control levels on day 12; b) total serum
   protein decreased on day 4, reached the lowest value on day 6 (3.3 +/-
   0.3 g/dl) and returned to control levels on day 16; c) Cp in urine
   increased on day 6, reached a peak value on day 8 (0.62 +/- 0.07
   mg/day), then decreased but remained high on day 20; and d) total
   protein in urine increased on day 5, reached a peak value on day 10 (692
   +/- 59 mg/day) and returned to control values on day 20. There was a
   close association between the levels of Cp and total protein in serum
   and urine. The decrease of circulating Cp indicates that a typical acute
   phase response does not occur in the PAN-nephrotic rats. The loss of Cp
   in the urine of the nephrotic rats may contribute to the decrease in the
   serum levels of this protein.},

Abstract = {The mutagenic potential of furfural was evaluated by means of the
   chromosome loss test in germ cells and the wing spot test in somatic
   cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The chromosome loss test was carried
   out employing repair-proficient as well as repair-deficient females.
   Males carried the compound Y chromosome, BsYy+. Two routes of
   administration were used: injection and feeding of adult males. Genetic
   damage was demonstrable after matings of treated males with females
   carrying the excision repair-deficient mutant mei-9a. The somatic
   mutation and recombination test was carried out treating 72-h
   transheterozygous mwh + / + flr3 larvae. Acute treatment of larvae was
   chosen as the method of exposure. Evidence indicates that furfural
   induces somatic damage as measured in the wing spot test.},

Abstract = {1. The aim of this work was to investigate if the asymmetric development
   of the two sets of visual photoreceptors responsible for short wave and
   long wave sensitivity during crayfish ontogeny influences the
   characteristics of the electroretinogram (ERG) amplitude rhythm.
   2. The parameters of the ERG rhythm of juvenile (2-12 weeks) and adult
   stages were studied in free-running conditions under blue, red or white
   light flash test.
   3. It was found that monochromatic light produces significant changes in
   the ERG circadian rhythm parameters in juvenile stages and has a 
   synchronizing effect on the ultradian rhythm prior to the ERG circadian
   rhythm.
   4. Based on these results we propose the existence of two sets of
   circadian photoreceptors related to two independent systems involved in
   the synchronization of the ERG circadian rhythm (a short wave and a long
   wave detection system).},

Abstract = {The present paper was aimed at establishing the time course for

   curve, PRC), the effect produced by single 15-min. light pulses on the
   period and phase of the ERG amplitude rhythm. It was found that the
   circadian rhythm of the ERG appears at relatively early stages of
   development (4th week after hatching) and that the entrainment mechanism
   developes after the crayfish has reached 2-5 months of age. The role
   played by the visual photoreceptors in the expression of the ERG rhythm
   as well as in its entrainment is discussed.},

Abstract = {We studied the fine structural organization of the meristematic nucleus
   in roots of Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) using ultracytochemical and
   immunocytochemical approaches.  The nucleus has a non-reticulate (i.e.
   low DNA content) structure whose supramolecular organization differs in
   some respects from that in reticulate nuclei, principally in the
   organization of the chromocentres associated with the nuclear envelope,
   with which centromeric structures appear to be associated.  The main
   difference at the nucleolar level is found in the fibrillar centres,
   which have a low amount of DNA labelling and in which inclusions of
   condensed chromatin are present only very rarely.  The distribution of
   nucleolar DNA amongst the nucleolar compartments is similar to that in
   reticulate nucleoli as demonstrated using an anti-DNA monoclonal
   antibody.  Tomato nuclei have nucleolus-associated bodies or karyosomes,
   like other plant species with a low DNA content and non-reticulate
   nuclear organization.  The nuclear ribonucleoprotein structures in the
   inter- and perichromatin regions; namely inter- and perichromatin
   fibrils and granules, show similar ultrastructural and cytochemical
   characteristics in both types of nuclei.},

Abstract = {1. The aim of this study was to analyse seasonal fluctuations in the
   respiration rate of pre-adults of Penaeus aztecus, P. setiferus,
   Scycionia brevirostris and Callinectes similis, and juveniles of
   Portunus spinicarpus, Hepatus ephelyticus and Calappa sulcata.
   2. A flow respirometer was used to determine the oxygen consumption of
   these decapods, which was measured every 2 hr during a 24 hr cycle in
   September (27 +/- 1-degree-C) and in April (22 +/- 1-degree-C).
   3. The respiration rates of seven species revealed uni-, bi- and
   trimodal patterns during the 24 hr cycle during both seasons. Metabolic
   amplitude of the shrimp species was reduced by 42\% during the coldest
   months of the year. In winter, when H. ephelyticus was absent, the
   metabolic amplitude of C. sulcata in that community was two-fold the
   value recorded in the summer. The metabolic amplitude of portunids and

   of seven crustacean species from the continental shelf of the NW Gulf of
   Mexico were related to the morphophysiological (exoskeleton thickness)
   and ecological (activity rhythms) adaptations.
   2.  Metabolic rate and the hemolymph glucose changed with the daily
   activity patterns observed in the shrimps (Penaeus aztecus:  nocturnal;
   Sicyonia brevirostris:  diurnal), the portunid crabs (Callinectes
   similis, Portunus spinicarpus and P. gibbesii; nocturnal) and the
   calappids (Calappa sulcata; diurnal; Hepatus ephelyticus:  non-selective
   activity pattern).
   3.  Rates of oxygen consumption versus glucose concentration were
   greater in shrimps than in portunids and calappids, and were related to
   exoskeleton thickness and activity rate.  The glucose concentration was
   considered as the main energy source for the crustacean muscle.
   4.  Proportion of glucose concentration in relation to oxygen
   consumption (100\%) varies among species, with lowest values for shrimps
   (55\%), against the values recorded in portunid (126\%) and calappid

   nonscarified seeds (0 to 5\%). Exposure to light did not break dormancy
   of nonscarified seeds. The reversal of dormancy by scarification
   describes them as hard seeds. Scarified seeds, 3 mo postharvest, were

Abstract = {The influence of seed structure, chemical composition and hydration rate

   showed different cooking time and rate of hydration but the same water
   uptake after imbibition time.
   Anatomical studies showed that OC, with the higher CTC, has a lower rate
   of hydration, thicker seed coat, higher percentage of seeds with
   obliterated mycropile and reduced surface area of the seed. Thus, the
   structural characteristics of the seed influence hydration rate but not
   hydration capacity. Also, the presence of tannins in the different
   structures was detected by histochemical tests.
   Due to the differential effect of soaking on the bean texture, the
   results suggest interaction between tannins and cytoplasmic
   macromolecules which could result in a higher thermal stability of these

Abstract = {By light and electron microscope cytochemistry we characterized the
   interphase nucleus of Lacandonia schismatica, the only known species of
   the new plant family Lacandoniaceae, whose most peculiar feature is the
   inverted position of the sexual organs, an aspect never found before
   among flowering plants. Furthermore, we compare it to Triuris alata, a
   related species, to Voyria aphylla (a dicotyledon), to Gymnosiphon
   divaricatus (a monocotyledon) and also to saprophytes. The reticulated
   chromatin of L schismatica and T alata is similar to that of other
   monocotyledons. In addition, we describe a unique type of RNP granules
   in the interchromatin space which are about 32 +/- 3 nm SD in diameter
   and occur as huge clusters. They are intermediate in size and spatial
   distribution between inter- and peri-chromatin granules. We term them
   `Lacandonia granules'. The granules were also found in T alata. They are
   31 +/- 2 nm in diameter. No significant differences in size were
   observed between them (P > 0.05). Synaptonemal-like complexes and
   ring-shaped structures were seen in interphase nuclei of somatic cells
   of these species. Coiled and nucleolus-associated bodies, as well as
   centromeres were also found in these two organisms. On the contrary, V
   aphylla and G divaricatus display a chromocentric nuclear organization.
   The nuclear similarities between L schismatica and T alata suggest
   extremely close phylogenetic relationships between them.},

Abstract = {The levels of collagenase inhibitor, both free and bound to
   metalloproteinases, were evaluated at 7 days {[}deposit phase (DP)] and
   14 days {[}resorptive phase (RP)] of evolution of the subcutaneous
   carrageenin-induced granuloma in the guinea pig. The level of free
   collagenase inhibitor was considerably higher in the supernatant of DP
   granulomas (7.95 +/- 1.53 U/mg protein) as compared to that of RP
   granulomas (2.53 +/- 0.41 U/mg protein). When the samples were heated at
   acid pH to release the inhibitor from metalloproteinase-inhibitor
   complexes, free inhibitor was recovered in both phases. However, the
   units of recovered collagenase inhibitor were several fold higher in all
   RP granulomas in comparison with DP granulomas (6.88 +/- 2.46 vs 1.5 +/-
   0.53). Therefore, DP and RP tissues exhibited similar total amount of
   tissue inhibitor. By HPLC, collagenase inhibitor activity was localized
   in a fraction consistent with the size of TIMP.  These results suggest a
   different balance of collagenase and collagenase inhibitor during the
   evolution of the granuloma; an excess of inhibitor over
   metalloproteinases appears to predominate during the phase of collagen
   accumulation contrasting with an inverse situation when the granuloma is
   healing.},

Title = {A REVIEW OF PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESES FOR LIZARDS OF THE GENUS SCELOPORUS
   (PHRYNOSOMATIDAE) - IMPLICATIONS FOR ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {1992},
Number = {213},
Pages = {1-110},
Abstract = {Species of Sceloporus have figured prominently in studies of population,
   community, and physiological ecology, social behavior, disease
   transmission, and biogeography, probably in large part because of the
   broad distribution of the genus in a variety of habitats, its species
   diversity, and the diurnal and conspicuous habits of most species, which
   are often locally abundant. Despite these advantages and the prevalence
   of Sceloporus in many research programs in organismal biology, many
   outstanding systematic and evolutionary problems remain, and the
   Sceloporus radiation has not been rigorously studied from a contemporary
   phylogenetic perspective. We have undertaken this review with two major
   objectives: (1) to summarize all information relevant to existing
   phylogenetic hypotheses for the genus, and make it available in a single
   document; and (2) to point out some of the ecological and evolutionary
   questions for which Sceloporus is superbly suited for detailed study,
   within the context of well-corroborated phylogenetic frameworks. With
   respect to the first objective, we have summarized the major
   phylogenetic conclusions of Smith, Larsen and Tanner, Cole, and those
   based on the largely unpublished cytogenetic data sets of W. P. Hall and
   C. J. Cole. Alternative hypotheses are compared and summarized with
   regard to major points of congruence and conflict, and we argue that
   thorough contemporary systematic studies are urgently needed for the
   entire Sceloporus radiation. With respect to the second objective, the
   Sceloporus radiation unequivocally shows three or more independent
   origins of viviparity, possibly five independently derived heteromorphic
   sex-chromosome systems, and perhaps six examples of independent
   secondary loss of sexual dimorphism in color pattern, regardless of
   which of the existing phylogenetic hypotheses most closely reflects the
   real evolutionary history. Different radiations within the genus also
   continue to offer challenging problems in historical biogeography,
   speciation, macroevolution, hybrid zone dynamics, taxonomy at the
   species level, population biology, physiological ecology, and
   comparative ethology. The genus also offers additional potential in
   relatively unexplored areas such as mate choice/sexual selection, the
   roles of regional gene duplication in genome evolution; and
   co-speciation/co-adaptation of host-parasite systems. This potential,
   particularly great because of the species diversity of the genus, is
   discussed within the context of comparative biology and phylogenetic
   inference.},

   goes through a maximum and the a lattice parameter through a minimum at
   x approximately 0.5 and the cell volumen decreases steadily from x = 0
   to x = 1.2.  The resistivity also shows a maximum for x approximately
   0.32 and then decreases until a minimum value is achieved around x
   approximately 1.1.  Mossbauer spectra consist of three quadrupole
   doublets whose quadrupole splittings vary in a similar way as the c

   distortions associated with these variations is discussed.},

   net, at 41 stations in the epipelagic region of the Gulf of California.
   The seventeen species of holoplanktonic polychaetes that were determined
   represent new records from this region. Tomopteris planktonis, with a
   relative abundance of 73\%, and 85\% of occurrence, was the dominant
   species.
   With respect to their biogeographical affinities, most species belong to
   a subtropical-tropical pattern, three species are true cosmopolitans,
   and two have warm-water affinities. The data agree with the general
   patterns of distribution recorded for other groups of zooplankton in the

   lower densities r(s) almost-equal-to 30, a second transition to a
   corrugated ferromagnetic phase is suggested.},

Abstract = {With the help of the quantum theory of scattering, a set of simultaneous
   difference equations is proposed, defining a diffusive stochastic
   process (correlated walk), which describes a semiclassical,
   one-dimensional, tunneling diffusion process in a periodic lattice. The
   jump probabilities are just the quantum transmission coefficients of the
   unit cell. With this process, we prove that by quantum tunneling or
   scattering above the potential, the particles diffuse in a
   one-dimensional lattice with a diffusion coefficient given by the
   Landauer formula. Next, the theory is generalized to include higher
   dimensions, and a square lattice case is shown as an example. There we
   show that the Landauer formula will not be obtained for 2D or 3D cases.
   Finally, examples are given, in which the Landauer formula is also valid
   for other cases of one-dimensional Markovian correlated walks.},

   find that it is possible to perform an exact SU(2) transformation for
   the Dirac Hamiltonian of the problem.  This procedure is formally
   equivalent to obtaining an exact form for the related Foldy-Wouthuysen
   Hamiltonian.  The potential problems that can be exactly diagonalized
   include the Dirac oscillator, an arbitrary, time-independent magnetic
   field, and all the odd potentials, as well as its non-Abelian
   generalizations.  We find that the internal group generators do not
   destroy the structure of the superalgebra.  We work out explicitly the

Abstract = {We study the statistics of the time evolution of the Game of Life.  We
   recognize three different time regimes of which the most interesting one
   is the long time glider regime, which has properties typical of a
   critical state.  We introduce mean field approximations able to give
   some insights on the time evolution of the density of living cells. 
   Extended simulations are reported which deal with the evolution of the
   density, damage spreading and the measurements of a finite size
   exponent.  A simple dynamical model explains some aspects of the
   asymptotic glider regime.  We study also the dependence of the
   asymptotic density on the initial density both analytically and
   numerically.},

Abstract = {Sand dune vegetation along the coast of the Mexican states of Tabasco
   and Campeche was sampled by means of 1501 releves and the data were
   analyzed with classification and ordination programs.  36 community
   types were distinguished, which were grouped into 10 higher-order
   groups.  The communities are described in a sequence reflecting the main
   vegetation zonation.  Beach, embryo dune and foredune community groups
   include 12 community types, the sheltered zone includes 16 types and the
   fixed dunes 8 types.  The ordination results reveal one main vegetation
   gradient corresponding to the increase in mean distance from the
   shoreline and elevation, and being covariant with species richness, mean
   vegetation cover and mean vegetation height.
   Additional differences are related to the geographical transition
   between the Gulf and Caribbean coastal vegetation and environmental
   conditions, mainly type of sand, occurring in the study area.  Siliceous
   sand and a Gulf climate are characteristic for most of Tabasco, and
   calcareous sand and a Caribbean-type climate are characteristic for
   Campeche.
   Disturbance caused by coconut plantations, cattle grazing and tourism
   favours the invasion of ruderal species from waste places behind the
   dunes, which attain local dominance in the dunes described here. 
   Consequently some separate community types had to be distinguished.
   The distribution of community types is analyzed in the context of the
   transitions between calcareous and siliceous substrates in the study
   area.},

Abstract = {The exact partition function per spin is obtained for a two-dimensional
   generalization of the Ising model. This general model consists of a
   unitary cell that is repeated throughout the system. The unitary cell is
   made up of spins in t columns and q rows with arbitrary energies between
   them. The exact result is given in terms of certain PSI quantities (see
   section 2), which can be determined for particular cases.
   It is always possible to transform the unit cell in order to obtain a
   desired given model. Thus, the results for several known models are
   recovered, e.g., the Utiyama and the hexagonal (with three different
   interaction parameters) models. Furthermore, explicit results are
   presented for other models hitherto not reported in the literature, as
   are the general hexagonal (with six different interaction parameters),
   the general triangular model (with six different interaction parameters)
   and the tetragonal-triangular (with seven different interaction
   parameters) models.},

Abstract = {The changes of the nuclear components caused by castration and
   testosterone injection were studied in epithelial cells of the ventral
   prostate of the rat. Castration drastically diminishes the nuclear and
   nucleolar volume, as well as the fraction of the nuclear volume occupied
   by non-nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibrils. However, in castrated
   animals the frequency of perichromatin granules (PCG) is 79\% higher
   than in controls. Testosterone injection causes a reduction of the
   number of PCG to 33\% of the castrated level in 15 min, and increases
   the non-nucleolar RNP fibrils. Other parameters such as nuclear and
   nucleolar volume and the relative volume of the compact chromatin
   present only small changes in a period of 2 h following the hormone
   administration. High resolution quantitative autoradiography
   demonstrates that the transportation of previously synthesized RNA
   increases steeper than the RNA synthesis. All these effects are similar
   to those caused by ovariectomy and estradiol injection on the nuclear
   structures of endometrial epithelial cells. These similarities and other
   observations suggest that PCGs contain mRNA, of a few genes, stored in
   the nucleus by a restriction of its transportation to the cytoplasm.},

Abstract = {1.  The present paper was aimed at studying the role of the

   2.  Using the ERG, spectral sensitivity of naive adult cryfishes was
   compared with that of sinus gland-deprived adult animals.
   3.  As opposed to naive animals, the sinus gland-deprived animals show a
   relatively high sensitivity to UV and a low sensitivity to red.
   4.  Comparison of these results with those previously obtained in
   animals during their development evidences a similar spectral
   sensitivity between the sinus gland-deprived animals and the very young
   ones.
   5.  The possible role of the neuroendocrine system in the synthesis of

Title = {THEORY OF DIFFUSION AND ELECTRIC CONDUCTION DUE TO QUANTUM TUNNELING
   ALONG THE C-AXIS OF LAYERED MATERIALS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {29},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1201-1208},
Abstract = {A lattice-kinetic theory is developed for the transport phenomena
   arising from the electron tunneling along the c-axis of a layered
   material such as wurtzite and graphite. The electron is allowed to
   tunnel through the potential barrier between the conducting layers with
   the success rate equal to the quantum transmission coefficient t if and
   only if it was proceeding toward the barrier before each transmission
   attempt. Each attempt is assumed to occur at a random time and without
   coherence. Under these conditions, the diffusion coefficient D is given
   by D = alpha-2/2<tau>t/1-t where alpha is the separation between the
   layers and <tau> is the average time between successive attempts. The
   above formula is in agreement with the macroscopic Landauer formula
   {[}Phil. Mag. 21, 863 (1970), equation (1)] but all relevant quantities
   (alpha, t, <tau>) are now defined microscopically. An explanation for
   the observed strong anisotropy in the conductivities along, and
   perpendicular to, the c-axis is proposed in terms of the charge states
   of conducting layers.},

   systems, with z = 0.04, were studied at several temperatures. The
   spectra of YBa2Cu3-xFeO-delta showed four asymmetric quadrupole doublets
   with apparently different line widths, which were fitted with four
   symmetric superimposed quadrupole doublets with the same line width, but
   assuming a small (approximately 4-6 kOe) residual magnetic field in the
   Fe sites, which are mainly the Cu(1) sites of the 1-2-3 structure. On
   the other hand, the PrBa2Cu3-xFeO-delta spectra showed only three
   asymmetric quadrupole doublets which can be fitted with three
   superimposed symmetric doublets and a residual magnetic field. In this
   case, the Fe atoms also occupy the Cu(l) sites of the 1-2-3 structure.
   The temperature variations of the Mossbauer spectra and their parameters
   seem to indicate that, in the Pr-system, a structural change takes place
   between 12 K and 40 K.},

Title = {GENERAL STABILITY CONDITIONS FOR A MULTILAYER MODEL},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {222},
Pages = {119-137},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sufficient conditions for the stability of steady solutions of a
   multi-layer model are found.  The basic flow may be either parallel,
   axisymmetric or non-parallel.  The lower boundary of the model may be
   either rigid, including the possibility of topography, or soft.  The
   latter, `reduced gravity', case represents an ideal situation in which
   the active layers are on top of an infinitely deep, motionless one.
   Two conditions are sufficient to assure the stability of the basic flow.
   It is conjectured that unstable flows for which only the first or second
   condition is violated decay through Rossby-like or Poincare-like growing
   perturbations, respectively.
   In order to understand the meaning of both conditions, assume that a
   quite general O(a) `wave' is superimposed on the basic flow:  an O(a2)
   energy integral, delta-2E can be calculated.  This wave energy is
   neither conserved, because the wave might exchange energy with the O(a2)
   varying part of the the `mean flow', nor positive definite, because the
   perturbation might lower the total energy by increasing the speed where
   it decreases the thickness, and vice versa.  Now, the first condition
   determines that delta-2E has an upper bound, and the second one implies
   that delta-2E is positive definite; hence the stability of the basic
   solution.  In the particular case of two-dimensional divergenceless
   flow, as well as for quasi-geostropic models, delta-2E is a priori
   positive definite, and therefore the first condition suffices to
   guarantee the stability of the more basic solution.  The conditions
   found here are indeed valid for more general perturbations, e.g. they
   prevent inertial (or `symmetric') instability, a phenomenon for which
   there is no distinction between wave and the varying part of the mean
   flow.},

Abstract = {1. The effect of eyestalk ablation on preadults of Callinectes similis
   exposed to a constant salinity (30 parts per thousand) and to simulated

   2. In constant salinity, crabs showed a persistent respiratory rhythm,
   with a maximum oxygen consumption during the day. Under these
   conditions, ablation significantly increased the respiratory rate but
   not the rhythm.
   3. In variable salinities, the highest respiratory rates occurred in
   salinities of 11 and 16 parts per thousand during the night. In these
   crabs, ablation of eyestalks and subsequent injection of eyestalk
   extracts did not alter the respiration rate rhythm.
   4. The circadian rhythm is controlled by the periodicity of
   environmental changes instead of the influence of eyestalk hormones.

Abstract = {1. Oxygen consumption in six crustacean species from the continental
   shelf of the NW Gulf of Mexico was related to the ash free weight per
   dry weight (afdw) gram of the tissue excluding the exoskeleton,
   suggesting a close relationship to their life strategies.
   2. Dry weight exoskeleton proportion varied among species, with highest
   values recorded in callapid brachyuran crab species (46.8-52.5\%)
   against the values recorded in portunid crab (45.8-48\%) and the shrimp
   species (26.7-35.7\%).
   3. Oxygen consumption was related to afdw in each species according to
   the expression y = ax(b), with b values ranging from 0.68 to 2.92.
   4. Rates of oxygen consumption per afdw/dw were larger in shrimps than
   in portunids and callapids, and was related to the morphophysiology and
   lifestyle of six species described; the former as the morphological
   design of the exoskeleton versus the muscle content in the species and
   the latter as the activity rate in the environment.
   5. The oxygen extraction efficiency, calculated from oxygen consumption,
   was higher in the eurytopic species Penaeus aztecus and Callinectes
   similis than in species restricted to the marine environment, hence
   considered as a response to environmental fluctuations.},

Abstract = {The analysis of biological assays has received the attention of
   statisticians for many years. However, when an indirect assay is
   considered and a continuous response variable is measured, the standard
   models lead to the problem of estimating a ratio, which has proved to be
   rather controversial if the statistical analysis is conducted under the
   classical approach. In this paper, within the Bayesian framework, the
   reference posterior distribution of slope ratio is obtained. This is the
   parameter of interest in a large class of biological assays. The results
   obtained are provided to avoid the drawbacks of the classical methods
   and generalize previous Bayesian analysis of the ratio of normal means.},

Abstract = {We present an analysis of the massive stellar population in 8 starburst

   (in part) by Sekiguchi and Anderson (1987a,b).  These lines are
   characteristic of early OB stars and represent good indicators of the
   massive stellar content.  Based on this analysis we estimate the mean
   ionizing effective temperature (T{*}ioniz) and compare these results
   with photoionization models.  Our method indicate larger values
   (approximately 8\%) for (T{*}ioniz).  We estimate the metallicities
   using different methods.  The photoionization models indicate larger
   metallicities than those derived by the other methods.  We also found
   that in the lower metallicity stellar systems there is a larger
   proportion of massive stars or a larger upper mass limit for the present
   day mass function.  This second possibility seems to agree better with
   photoionization models.},

Abstract = {We studied species composition, similarity, and structure of homegardens
   in two Yucatecan Maya communities, Tixpeual and Tixcacaltuyub, Yucatan,
   Mexico.  The number of gardens sampled per village was 20 and 22; total
   area sampled was very similar, 45,265 m2 and 40,150 m2; the number of
   trees and shrubs present was 5651 and 5603; and number of species was
   135 and 133, respectively.  Diversity was low for both sites (H' = 1.6),
   as were the correlation coefficients (r) for the species-area and
   individuals-area correlations.  The relatively low values obtained for
   the structural parameters reflect the random pattern of plant
   incorporation to the gardens, the variability in the proportion of
   constantly used and not constantly used garden area, and a certain
   uniformity in the number of species used and number of individuals
   present, and the relationship between these parameters and garden size. 
   All these reflect the uniqueness of each homegarden, which depends upon
   the cultural background of the owner.  We noticed a trend towards a
   change in homegarden structure and function in response to the
   modernization process.  Homegardens in villages in the outskirts of
   cities tend to have more ornamental species and commercial fruit plants
   than homegardens in isolated villages.},

Abstract = {Sun leaves of 68 species of trees, shrubs, and palms of the tropical
   rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico, were studied with respect
   to morphology, anatomy, and mineral levels.  The average leaf had a size
   of 0.95 dm2 and an oblongate form (three times as long as wide); per m2
   surface area it contained 79 g of dry matter, a maximum of 170 g water,
   and 13.0, 1.0, and 7.7 mg of N, P, and K, respectively.  The average
   leaf had an abaxial stomatal density of 409 mm-2, and stomata were
   21-mu-m long.  Leaf thickness was 207-mu-m, and nonpalisade mesophyll
   was 1.4 times as thick as palisade mesophyll.  Many species (75\%) had a
   multilayered palisade mesophyll, whereas the frequency of occurrence of
   trichomes (5\%) and of crystals in the lamina (15\%) was low.  Variation
   among species was moderately high, nearly all parameters had a
   coefficient of variation (CV) between 28\% and 57\%.  Leaf area, leaf
   shape, and stomatal density had a CV of over 100\% due to a skewed
   distribution.  Several parameters were correlated, especially specific
   leaf weight (SLW) and lamina thickness.  Los Tuxtlas leaves were
   compared with leaves from other tropical rain forests.  In general, the
   leaves of Los Tuxtlas had a similar leaf size, a relatively low SLW, a
   high N and P content, low N/P and K/P ratios, a high stomatal density, a
   thin lamina, and a low nonpalisade to palisade ratio.  With respect to
   leaf characteristics, the Los Tuxtlas forest may be regarded as a
   typical example of tropical lowland rain forest.},

Abstract = {The ultrastructural distribution of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
   (U1-snRNP and Sm antigen) in the nucleus of Chironomus salivary gland
   cells was investigated by means of specific antibodies and
   immunocytochemistry using colloidal gold complexes as markers.
   Particular attention was paid to the structural relationships of snRNPs
   with transcriptionally active areas in polytene chromosomes and with
   Balbiani ring granules. Our results demonstrate strong binding of
   anti-snRNP antibodies to RNP fibrils or the fibrillar network occurring
   within nuclear regions active in transcription (Balbiani rings or minor
   puffs). This confirms data reported previously on mammalian cells
   showing early association of snRNPs with nuclear fibrillar constituents
   containing newly synthesized pre-mRNA. In addition, Balbiani ring
   granules in the process of formation at the transcriptionally active
   sites were sometimes labeled on their periphery or on the transitory
   part between the granule and its precursor  RNP fibril, while free
   granules observed in the nucleoplasm were virtually devoid of label.
   These findings suggest that mRNA processing, including splicing, takes
   place prior to the formation of mature Balbiani ring granules.},

Abstract = {Sceloporus mucronatus is a high altitude viviparous lizard with a

   Mexico, provide specimens representing all stages of gametogenesis.
   Spermatogenesis was initiated in October at a time of low testicular
   volume. Spermiogenesis coincided with maximal testicular volume during
   the summer months (May through August) and spermatozoa were present in
   epididymides in June, July, and August. Interstitial cells occurred in
   greatest abundance from May-July. Vitellogenesis commenced in June with
   ovulation occurring in October. Corpora lutea persisted throughout the
   winter gestation. Atretic follicles were present in the vitellogenic
   phase and throughout embryonic development. Timing of sperm maturation
   and ovulation differs, indicating that germ cell maturation and gonadal
   cycle are not synchronized between sexes.},

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Volume = {82},

Pages = {122-127},
Abstract = {Leaf dynamics of eight tropical rain forest species seedlings was
   studied in three environments: the shaded forest understorey, a small
   gap of .+-. 50 m2, and a large gap of .+-. 500 m2. Leaf production rate
   and leaf loss rate were enhanced in gaps, and a large gap resulted in
   larger increases than a small gap. For most species net leaf gain rate
   was larger in gaps, although this rate was not always largest in the
   large gap. Leaf loss decreased, and leaf survival percentages increased
   with increasing shade tolerance of species, indicating a slower leaf
   turnover for more shade tolerant species. Leaf area growth rate was only
   partly determined by net leaf gain rate. Ontogenetic effects on leaf
   size were also important, especially in the large gap. Species which
   possessed leaves with high specific leaf weight (SLW) showed lower leaf
   loss rates and higher leaf survival percentages than species with low
   SLW leaves. Leaf life span seemed to be related to leafcost per unit
   area. The relation of specific patterns in leaf production and leaf loss
   to the regeneration mode of the species is briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {In order to analyze the mechanisms involved in the decreased
   collagenolytic activity previously observed in interstitial lung
   fibrosis, we studied the inhibitory collagenase activity and the latent
   activable collagenase in lung samples from five patients with IPF, six
   with HP, and three control subjects. Our results showed that in both
   diseases, the inhibitor levels were significantly higher than in control
   subjects. Findings suggest that in IPF low amounts of collagenase plus
   excessive enzyme-inhibitors may be operating to decrease collagen
   catabolism. In contrast, HP lungs seem to contain adequate amounts of
   the enzyme but higher levels of inhibitors play a role in the abnormal
   degradation observed in some patients.},

Abstract = {Samples of rat livers were fixed in glutaradehyde, contrasted en bloc
   with phosphotungistic acid, embedded in an epoxy resin and serially
   sectioned. The study of three-dimensional models of 20 complete nuclei
   shows that all of them share some general features:they have more than
   one nucleolus (2-4), an irregular layer of compact chromatin adjacent to
   the nuclear membrane and well-delimited clumps of chromatin both in the
   nuclear sap and surrounding the nucleoli. A space of 8 sections
   containing  the central nucleolus and a lateral one was studied in
   detail. In this space, 8 clumps of compact chromatin were found in 17
   nuclei and 9 clumps in the other 3 nuclei. No other number of clumps was
   found in those zones. In all the nuclei studied the compact chromatin
   surrounding the central nucleolus contacts the nuclear envelope. This
   contact takes place in a region almost diametrically opposed to the
   lateral nucleolus in 13 nuclei. In 7 nuclei, these structures were at
   angles between 50 and  125 degrees. These results support the existence
   of nonrandom repetitive patterns of chromatin distribution in liver
   cells.},

Abstract = {The oviduct of Ambystoma mexicanum is composed of three gross
   morphological regions: an anterior infundibulum, a middle convoluted
   region and a posterior terminal region. Histologically, the oviduct is
   composed of a luminal mucosa, a lamina propria, a circular muscle layer,
   and an outer serosa. The infundibulum is thin walled and has a highly
   folded mucosa. The mucosa is composed of low columnar ciliated cells
   anteriorly, whereas both ciliated and secretory cells occur in the
   posterior  infundibulum. The lamina propria and circular muscle layer
   are reduced in thickness, although tubular glands of the lamina propria
   occur posteriorly. The middle convoluted region is thicker walled than
   the infundibulum but has lower mucosal folds. The mucosa is composed of
   low columnar ciliated cells anteriorly, and tall columnar ciliated and
   secretory cells posteriorly. The glands of the lamina propria are
   tubular and form the major portion of the wall''s thickness. The size
   and quantity of the glands diminish posteriorly. A thin layer of
   connective tissue and circular smooth muscle surrounds the glandular
   tissue. The posterior region is short and straight, with increased
   mucosal folding composed of tall columnar epithelia of both ciliated and
   secretory cell types. Few tubular glands are observed. Thick layers of
   connective tissue and circular smooth muscle form the bulk of the wall.
   Melanocytes are scattered near the tubular glands and blood vessels.},

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS},
Year = {1989},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {103-116},
Abstract = {The evolutionary variations of nuclear structure of animals, plants,
   fungi and protoctists were studied with electron microscopy by using
   techniques preferentially staining ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles and
   chromatin. A remarkable similarity in the general morphological features
   of the RNP particles and chromatin arrangement is found in animals,
   plants and fungi. Important variations of these features were found in
   protoctists. These observations suggest that major evolutionary changes
   in  the nuclear structure predate the acquisition of plastids by the
   ancestors of green plants. Once evolved, the nuclear structural pattern
   is conserved in plants and animals. Among protoctists studied,
   Kinetoplastida, Cryptomonadida and Volvocida have RNP particles and
   chromatin arrangement resembling those of plants and animals. These
   similarities may indicate a common ancestor. Important differences in
   the nuclear structure among Euglenida, Amebida, Cryptomonadida,
   Volvocida and Kinetoplastida  support the view that Sarcomastigophora is
   a polyphyletic taxon. For the same reason Kinetoplastida and Euglenida
   must not be grouped in a monophyletic taxon. We propose that the
   variations of RNP particles may be related to the initial evolution of
   post-transcriptional processing.},

Abstract = {Nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles were studied in the central nervous

   formed of 14-nm granules related by a 7-nm thick filament were found.
   These polyparticles are positively contrasted by a preferential method
   for ribonucleoproteins and they are sensitive to RNAse. Perichromatin
   granules are loosened by this fixation and their internal structure is 
   clearly depicted. They are composed of a tangled mass of 3-nm thick
   filaments, but lack 14-nm granules. The internal filaments of the
   perichromatin granules display frequent continuities with polyparticles.
   These results show that polyparticles correspond to perichromatin
   fibrils visualized in nuclei by standard fixation procedures.},

Year = {1988},
Volume = {74},

Pages = {55-80},

Abstract = {Physiognomy, structure and floristic composition of one hectare of
   lowland tropical rain forest was studied in detail at Low Tuxtlas,
   Mexico. Physiognomically, the Los Tuxtlas forest should be classified as
   `'lowland tropical high evergreen rain forest''. The forest showed a
   closed canopy at 30-35 m. Of all woody, non-climbing species with DBH
   .gtoreq. 1.0 cm 89.4\% (94.5\% of all individuals) were evergreen,
   25.4\% (59.5\% of the individuals) had compound leaves, and over 80\% of
   species (and individuals) had leaves in the notophyll and mesophyll size
   classes. The forest structure was characterized by a low density (2976
   individuals with a DBH .gtoreq. 1.0 cm, 346 individuals with a DBH
   .gtoreq. 10.0 cm, per ha, excluding vines) with an average basal area
   (38.1 m2, DBH .gtoreq. 1.0 cm, 34.9 m2, DBH .gtoreq. 10.0 cm, per ha,
   excluding vines). This was attributed to the relative maturity of the
   forest on the study plot. The study plot contained 234 species (11,208
   individuals with a height .gtoreq. 0.5 m), of which 55.1\% (34.8\% of
   individuals) were trees, 9.4\% (6.8\%) shrubs, 3.4\% (44.3\%) palms,
   20.1\% (5.2\%) vines, 6.8\% (8.7\%) herbs and 5.1\% (0.3\%) of unknown
   lifeform. Furthermore, 58 species of epiphytes and hemi-epiphytes were
   found. Diversity of trees, shrubs and palms with a DBH .gtoreq. 1.0 cm
   was calculated as Shannon-Wiener index (4.65), Equitability index
   (0.65), and Simpson index (0.10). The dominance-diversity curve showed a
   lognormal form, characteristic for topical rain forest. The community
   structure was characterized by a relative dominance of Astrocaryum
   mexicanum in the understorey, Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria in the middle
   storeys, and Nectandra ambigens in the canopy. Species population
   structures of 31 species showed three characteristic patterns,
   differentiated by recuruitment: continuously high, discontinuously high,
   and continuously low recruitment. Height/diameter and crown
   cover/diameter diagrams suggested a very gradual shift from height
   growth to crown growth  during tree development. Forest turnover was
   calculated as 138 years. Compared to other tropical rain forests the Los
   Tuxtlas forest had 1. similar leaf physiognomical characteristics, 2. a
   lower diversity, 3. a lower density, 4. an average basal area, and 5. a
   slow canopy turnover.},

Abstract = {Legumes contain high concentrations of protein. However, in evaluating
   wild legumes as a possible food source for both humans and animals, it
   is necessary to determine true protein content, since many legumes also
   contain substantial concentrations of non-protein amino acids which
   contribute significantly to a total nitrogen measurement. As much as
   33\% of the total nitrogen was found to be non-protein nitrogen in some
   legumes we examined. Some non-protein amino acids have undesirable
   physiological effects on the animals which consume them. Therefore, the
   identity of any of them is also important if wild legumes are to be
   seriously considered for an animal diet. Several wild and cultivated
   legumes were assayed in this study and ten non-protein amino acids were
   investigated; however only three of them were found in high
   concentrations: DOPA in the seeds of velvet bean and chupabaya,
   canavanine in alverjon and cacahuanane seeds and mimosine in palo fierro
   and guaje seeds. Five non-protein amino acids were not detected in the
   legumes studied; however, some non-identified peaks appeared in the
   aminograms of several legumes that has to be investigated in future
   work.},

Abstract = {The vertical structure of one hectare of tropical rain forest was
   studied at Los Tuxtlas, State of Veracruz, Mexico. The structure was
   analysed at various scales of analysis, using different methodologies
   e.g. profile diagrams (0.1 ha) and vertical structure diagrams (1 ha).
   All prolife diagrams suggested presence of stratification to some
   extent. However, simultaneous evaluation of several adjacent profile
   diagrams showed that the use of one profile diagram only can be very
   misleading: gaps or layers apparent in a diagram did usually not reflect
   gaps or layers that could be recognized in the field. Structures
   diagrams of abundance, basal area and crown cover showed that this
   forest community is not stratified, with the exception of an understorey
   layer below 7.5 m dominated by palms. The vertical structure was
   described using arbitrarily chosen height intervals. From the forest
   floor to the canopy top basal area, percentage of deciduous species (and
   individuals), and percentage of  compound-leaved species (and
   individuals), increased, but total number of individuals and number of
   species decreased. Leaf sizes tended to decrease in the same direction,
   and crown cover was approximately evenly distributed. Species from
   different families dominated different parts along the vertical plane.
   It is concluded that the vertical structure of tropical rain forest can
   best be described as a complex gradient, involving many community
   features. Stratification can best be emphasized as  a special case of
   such a gradient.},

Volume = {75},

Pages = {625-632},
Abstract = {Growth and morphology of seedlings of ten tropical rain forest species
   were studied at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Seedlings were grown in three
   environmental conditions: the shaded forest understorey (FU, receiving
   0.9-2.3\% of the daily photosynthetic photon flux, PF, above the
   canopy), a small canopy gap of approx. 50 m2 (SG, receiving 2.1-6.1\% of
   daily PF), and a large canopy gap of approx. 500 m2 (LG, receiving
   38.6-53.4\% of daily PF). The growth of all species was enhanced in
   gaps, and in LG  the effect was stronger than in SG. Plants grown in LG
   had a sunplant morphology, with a high root-shoot ratio (R/S), a high
   specific leaf weight (SLW) and a low leaf area ratio (LAR). Plants grown
   in SG or FU showed a shade-plant morphology, with a low R/S, a low SLW
   and a high LAR. Growth responses varied from species unable to grow in
   the shade but with strong growth in the sun, to species with relatively
   high growth rates in both shade and sun conditions. Shade tolerant
   species were able to grow in the shade because of a relatively high unit
   leaf rate. The pioneer Cecropia had a high growth rate in LG because of
   a high LAR. Most species showed a complex growth response in which they
   resembled the shade intolerant extreme in some aspects of the response,
   and the shade tolerant extreme in other aspects.},

Abstract = {Multiple sightings of a distinctive but unidentified species of beaked
   whale have been made in the eastern tropical Pacific. The unidentified
   whale has two color morphs: a conspicuously marked black and white form
   (judged to be larger), and a uniformly gray-brown form. Maximum length
   estimates have been 5-5.5 m. Other features include a relatively flat
   head, with a small, distinct melon; a moderately long beak; and a low,
   wide-based, triangular dorsal fin. On most animals the trailing edge of
   the dorsal fin is only slightly falcate and often appears straight. One
   the black and white morph, a broad white or cream-colored swathe
   originates immediately posterior to the dorsal surface of the head and
   runs posterio-ventrally on either side of the animal. The prevalence of
   scarring on the black and white animals suggests sexual dimorphism and
   that these larger, more conspicuously marked animals are adult males,
   while the smaller, browner, unscarred animals are females and young. 
   Possibilities for identification include: 1) a well-marked race of a
   known Mesoplodon sp. 2) Mesoplodon (Indopacetus) pacificus or 3) an
   undescribed species.},

Abstract = {From observations of the spatial distribution of humpback whales in the
   Mexican Pacific between 1981 and 1986, it is possible to recognize four
   subregions: I) the southerm coast of Baja California; 2) the northern
   Gulf of California, including the Midriff Islands; 3) the mainland coast
   of Mexico, including the Isla Isabel and Islas Tres Marias and 4) the
   Revillagigedo Archipelago. The seasonal distribution of whales near the
   Mexican mainland and the Revillagigedo Archipelago extends from November
   to May and is similar to that of other winter breeding grounds,
   including the Hawaiian Islands {[}USA]. Along the southern coast of Baja
   California, whales have been observed from September to April, possibly
   indicating a shorter migratory route. In the northern Gulf of
   California, however, humpback whales have been reported throughout the
   year and are occasionally observed feeding during both summer and winter
   months. The degree of individual movement between the four subregions is
   still unknown. The number of individual humpback whales identified
   photographically in recent years suggests that there are more whales in
   the Mexican Pacific than previously reported.},

Volume = {128},

Abstract = {In previous works it has been shown that the striated fibers of the
   cremaster muscle undergo a calcium-dependent healing-over reaction after
   transection and that the fibers of the diaphragm under the same
   conditions do not recover. In the present work striated fibers of the
   cremaster and diaphragm are studied, using electrophysiological
   techniques, light and electron microscopy, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after
   transection in an attempt to clarify the process leading to the recovery
   of the fibers of the cremaster muscle. The recording of membrane
   potentials at different times after the lesion in the immediate vicinity
   of the cut end demonstrates that the new diffusion barrier is formed at
   the damaged surface. Light microscopy of fibers of cremaster transected
   in vitro indicates the existence of a rapid process preventing the
   outflow of particulate constituents of the cytoplasm 1 min after the
   lesion. Electron microscopy shows that this hindrance is due to a
   compact disposition of filaments  derived from altered myofibrils near
   the cut end. This filamentary plug does not exist in the diaphragm. Cell
   membrane closing is a slow phenomenon which is completed between 30 and
   60 min after the lesion in different fibers. No reconstitution of the
   cell membrane was found in the fibers of the diaphragm. Rapid and slow
   responses are interpreted as particular cases of the surface
   precipitation reaction known in several cell types for more than 40
   years.},

Abstract = {The floral biology of P. ellipticum and the foraging patterns of its
   visitors were studied near Tlayacapan, Morelos, Mexico (at 1950 m
   altitude). P. ellipticum (Bombacaceae) presents big flowers (red or
   white) that produce nectar during the night and the following morning.
   At night three species of bats (Leptonycteris sanborni, Choeronycteris
   mexicana, and Glossophaga leachtt. Family Phyllostomidae) visited the
   flowers rapidly and always carried mixed pollen loads (of P. ellipticum 
   and Ipomoea sp.). During the day the flowers were visited by three
   oriole species (Icterus wagleri, I. pustulatus, and I. galbula
   bullocki), two hummingbird species (Amazilia violiceps and Cynanthus
   sordidus), and by four species of bees. The foraging patterns of the
   birds are affected by the total amount of available nectar and by inter-
   and intraspecific agonistic interactions, whereas the foraging patterns
   of the bees depend on the availability of pollen. The visitors can be 
   classified in three categories: main pollinators (bats), minor
   pollinators (orioles), and parasites (hummingbirds and bees). Bees play
   a very important negative role by reducing oriole pollination.},

Abstract = {Spermatogenesis of Schizomus palaciosi occurs in cysts in paired tubular
   testes located ventrally in the opisthosoma. Only few germ cells
   comprise one cyst. In early spermiogenesis an acrosomal complex composed
   of a spherical vacuole and a short acrosomal filament is established
   opposite of which a 9 .times. 2+3 flagellum emerges from a flagellar
   tunnel. The latter, however, is only a short-lasting structure. A
   manchette of microtubules surrounds nucleus and part of the acrosomal
   vacuole. The alterations in the arrangement of the microtubules during
   spermiogenesis are described. The spermatid finally is an elongate cell
   with a slender acrosomal vacuole on top of the helical nucleus. A deep
   implantation fossa filled with dense material is encountered. The
   acrosomal vacuole is accompanied by an intricate paracrosomal lattice
   structure not known at present of other Arachnida. This structure
   disappears during final spermiogenesis. The acrosomal filament
   (perforatorium) reveals filamentous subunits arranged in a regular
   pattern. Large ovoid mitochondria do not establish a distinct middle
   piece. Finally the elongate spermatid is coiled to form the mature
   spherical spermatozoon. The results are discussed under functional and
   taxonomical aspects.},

Abstract = {The study of the disposition of chromatin in the interphasic nucleus
   requires the combination of serial sectioning and a specific or
   preferential chromatin staining. The staining of chromatin with
   phosphotungstic acid (PTA) chromatin was originally employed on sections
   of glycolmethacrylate-embedded samples. As it is very difficult to
   obtain ribbons with this resin, we introduced a modification which
   consisted of staining the tissue after fixation and before dehydration,
   in order that epoxy  resins can be applied. Several procedures were
   tried and the best results were attained in the following way. Standard
   fixation of samples no thicker than 1 mm was carried out with 2.5\%
   glutaraldehyde at pH 7.2 for 1 or 2 h at room temperature; tissues were
   then rinsed three times with 0.2N HCl adjusted to pH 2.1-2.3 with 0.2N
   NaOH for 15 min. Staining was held with 3\% W/V PTA in 1N HCl adjusted
   to the same pH. Samples were dehydrated in gradual ethyl alcohol
   concentrations and Epon-embedded.  Post-staining on sections with
   uranyl-acetate and lead-citrate or other methods may be used to
   demonstrate other cell components and their relations to chromatin.},

Journal = {ARCHIVOS DE INVESTIGACION MEDICA},

Abstract = {The present work reports a study on the reproductive record in the
   laboratory of the volcan mouse (Neotomodon alstoni alstoni), of females
   mated during 1 and 2 estrous cycles, in 3 successive pairings. The mice
   were captured in a region of the Sierra del Volcan Ajusco, near Cerro
   Pelado (Subdelegacion Parres, Delegacion Tlalpan, Mexico, D. F.), kept
   under standard laboratory conditions and fed with ALBI-LAB (Albinosa,
   Mexico, D. F.) supplement with carrots, lettuce and tap water. Three 
   successive pairings done by pairs were done during 1 and 2 estrous
   cycles, making the pairs at random with wild males captured
   simultaneously. The pairings of 1 cycle lasted 6 days, while those of 2
   cycles lasted 12 days; thus the females mated during 1 cycle were
   separated at the 7th day and at the 13th day those mated during 2
   cycles. The number of females mated in the three pairings were 30 and
   27, 19 and 28, and 28 for 1 or 2 estrous cycles, respectively; these
   pairings were done between  May and October 1985. The results of
   females, and the total number of young born in the 2 cycle alternative
   practically doubled those obtained in the 1 cycles alternative. 2. The
   mean litter number was similar for both alternatives in all the
   pairings. 3. The male-female ratio was near 1:1. 4. The percentage of
   youngs alive at the first week of life and at weaning, was very similar
   for the 2 alternatives of all the three pairings. The main conclusions
   of this research were: 1. In the first pairing there were no noticeable
   differences in the reproductive record of 1 cycle versus 2 cycles; 2.
   The number and percentage of pregnant females, the total number of young
   born and the total number of young alive at the first week of life and
   at weaning, showed a reproductive record markedly higher for the 2 cycle
   alternative; 3. The fact that this study establishes a superior
   reproductive record for the 2 estrous cycle alternative, represents a
   tangible advancement in the knowledge of the  biology of reproduction of
   Neotomodon alstoni alstoni and of other rodents, and at the same time
   has a definite practical importance for increasing the production of the
   volcano mouse in the laboratory.},

Abstract = {Collagen metabolism was studied in both, the developing and resorptive
   phases of carrageenin granuloma. The rate of collagen biosynthesis
   relative to the rate of total protein synthesis is almost twice as high
   during the deposit phase compared with the resorptive phase of the same
   process. Total collagenolytic activity appears to be approximately the
   same in both, deposit and resorption stages of the granuloma.
   Notwithstanding, the enzyme is fully active during resorption; whereas
   half of this activity is in a latent form during deposit. Collagenolytic
   activity increased remarkably when assayed at 30 mM CaCl2 as compared to
   10 or 50 mM.},

Journal = {ACTA ANATOMICA},

Abstract = {The effects of changes of progesterone concentration on 3H-uridine
   incorporation and on the volume or number of nuclear ribonucleoprotein
   particles of the rat endometrial epithelial cells are studied in vivo
   and in vitro. All progesterone treatments are carried out after
   estradiol priming and their results are compared with estradiol-treated
   controls sampled from the same uterus or the same pool of isolated
   cells. Progesterone induces the same changes, in the parameters studied,
   administered  in vivo or in vitro. Nuclear volume undergoes small but
   significant increases between 1/2 and 8 h of treatment. The total number
   of extranucleolar ribonucleoprotein structures as well as the
   incorporation of 3H-uridine on non-nucleolar areas are also increased by
   progesterone treatments. The numerical density of perichromatin granules
   does not change during these experiments. The nucleolar volume and the
   incorporation of 3H-uridine in this structure are increased after an
   early diminution.  Progesterone apparently induces small increases in
   the rate of transcription in the nucleolus and in non-nucleolar genes.
   The constancy of the density of perichromatin granules suggests that
   progesterone, in contrast to estradiol, does not affect the
   transcription/transportation ratio of RNA to the cytoplasm.},

   fungicides at rates of 750 and 1125 ppm of active ingredient. In another
   storage experiment seeds of the cultivar VS-524 with a moisture content
   of 12.5 were treated with the same fungicides at rates of 125 and 750
   ppm. Both storage experiments were carried out at 85\% RH {[}relative

   showed no significant differences between application rates, but
   significant differences were detected between treatments. The untreated

Abstract = {The testes of C. boneti are composed of a germinal and a secretory part.
   Epithelial cells of the latter are capable of phagocytosing mature
   spermatozoa besides secreting a proteinaceous secretory product
   delivered into the lumen of the testes. The germinal part comprises
   somatic cells surrounding cysts of germ cells. Mature spermatozoa are
   roundish cells. Their central cytoplasm is ensheathed by 2
   electron-dense intracellular plates. An elongated nucleus and an axoneme
   of the usual 9 .times. 2 + 2 pattern are rolled up within the cell. An
   acrosomal complex comprising a small acrosomal vacuole and an acrosomal
   filament is present. Early spermatogenesis shows that 8 electron-dense
   plates are derived from Golgi vesicles and are distributed to the
   spermatids during meiotic divisions. Elongation of spermatids occurs
   during chromatin condensation. The nucleus is paralleled by the axonemal
   tubules which are attached via a specialized centriolar region to the
   anterior curved acrosomal vacuole.},

Abstract = {The cytological study of the endosperm of T. corymbosa seed with the
   light microscope showed that its reserve is not mobilized during the 1st
   stages of germination. Its degradation begins 60 h after the radicle
   emerges, reaching its maximum within the following 60 h. The endosperm,
   formed by a hygroscopic polysaccharide, probably a galactomannan,
   evidently provides the necessary moisture for germination.},

   stimulus that represents a potential damage for the insect. The DR could
   be also elicited by an actual noxious (an electrical shock) and that
   this response is similar to that elicited by a potential nociceptive
   stimulus (a patterned visual stimulus). The DR elicited by the electric
   shock was used as a model for studying the analgesic effect of opiates.
   The mantis was  placed in an apparatus that gave the insect an
   electrical shock and to measure the strength of its DR. During a 1st
   session the voltage threshold necessary to induce a full DR was
   determined, and then, the insect was injected with a certain solution.
   The voltage threshold was tested 1, 2 and 4 h after injection. Mantises
   that were injected with only distilled water showed no changes in their
   voltage threshold during the 3 tests. Injections of 300, 350 and 400
   .mu.g/g of morphine-HCl increased the  voltage threshold in both a
   time-dependent and a dose related manner. A dose of 350 .mu.g/g of
   morphine-HCl produced 50\% of response inhibition after two hours of
   injections and is referred to as the median antinoxious dose (AD50).
   Naloxone (16 .mu.g/g) given in conjunction with an AD50 of morphine,
   partially blocked the effect of morphine during the 1st h and fully
   blocked it during the 2nd h. Naloxone (32 .mu.g/g) fully blocked the
   morphine effect during the 1st and the 2nd h. More than 48 .mu.g/g of 
   naloxone alone also increased the voltage threshold in insects, similar
   to those described for vertebrates.},

Abstract = {The collagenase present in experimental carrageenin granuloma in the
   guinea pig has been purified to homogeneity in acrylamide gel
   electrophoresis by a combination of ammonium sulfate salting out and
   affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B-collagen-packed columns. The
   single protein band thus obtained was used as an antigen to obtain a
   monospecific antibody in heterologous conditions. Several
   immunodiffusion, immunoaffinity chromatography and immunoinhibition
   tests of the antibody against the  specific antigen and various possible
   serum and tissue contaminants suggested that the antibody was
   specifically directed against the enzyme protein collagenase. Indirect
   immunohistochemical staining of carrageenin granulomas, sampled at
   different developmental phases with this specific anti-collagenase
   antibody, revealed that the specific antigenic protein (the enzyme
   collagenase) is universally present on the extracellular structures at
   both the collagen-deposition and the collagen-resorption  stages.
   Apparently, the enzyme collagenase is bound to its substrate (collagen)
   under both normal and pathological conditions, and the critical point of
   control of collagen degradation must be the activation of the
   collagen-bound enzyme.},

Abstract = {A mathematical model of the dynamics of plant-pollinator interaction is
   presented. The functional response of individual pollinators to the
   density of plants is considered and this makes possible the existence of
   2 equilibrium points for the association. The stability analysis is
   framed in terms of 2 parameters of the model: the nectar rewards which
   the plant offers the pollinator and the specificity of the pollinator to
   the plant. There is an optimum level of nectar production which
   maximizes the plant birth rats; increasing nectar production and/or
   decreasing pollinator specificity produce more stable associations; for
   highly specific pollinators a conflict arises between stability of
   association and optimality in nectar production.},

   IN THE SEMINAL-VESICLES OF THE CASTRATED GOLDEN-HAMSTER},
Journal = {ARCHIVOS DE INVESTIGACION MEDICA},
Year = {1980},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {361-375},
Abstract = {The possibility of preventing the abnormal, yellow-brown pigment that is
   present in the seminal vesicles of the castrated hamster was possible by
   means of vitamin E (20-500 mg\%), methylene blue (126 mg\%), SeO2
   (20-200 mcg\%) and licidril (dimethylaminoethyl-p-chlorophenol and
   acetate, 1\%) given in the basic diet was examined. Prepubertal hamsters
   (strain Ch CM) were used; they were fed during 120 experimental days
   Purine laboratory chow as a basic diet and were castrated at the
   beginning of the experiment. Apparently, 100-500 mg\% of vitamin E
   levels and methylene blue at the administered level prevents the
   macroscopic evidence of this pigment whereas SeO2 and licidril do not
   prevent the formation of this pigment at the levels administrated.

Journal = {MEDICAL HYPOTHESES},
Year = {1980},
Volume = {6},
Number = {7},
Pages = {711-726},
Abstract = {The local control of collagen degradation in mammals in vivo depends
   primarily on variations on the level of activity of specific
   collagenases. Such variations apparently depend on 3 factors: the rate
   of active collagenase synthesis and/or of activation of inactive enzyme
   precursors, the action of serum and/or tissue collagenase inhibitors
   different combinations of both mechanisms. Apparently another element
   contributing to the regulation of collagen degradation in vivo is the
   substrate susceptibility. Support for this suggestion is derived from 2
   sources: experimental data, indicating that the rate of collagen
   degradation depends on the genetic type of substrate, on its state of
   aggregation (including degree of cross-linking) the nature and amount of
   other macromolecules associated with collagen in vivo, the universal
   presence of collagen-bound collagenase, the apparent greater affinity of
   the enzyme for the more recently synthetized substrate molecules and the
   increased amounts of intact collagen that may be solubilized from some
   tissues undergoing massive collagen degradation; analogy with
   intracellular protein catabolism mechanisms, which cannot be rejected a
   priori as irrelevant to the problem.},

Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 3},
Abstract = {Spatial distribution pattern was studied for Ceratozamia fuscoviridis,
   an endangered species in Mexico. The conservation importance of this
   species lies in the fact that it is endemic to a relatively small
   geographic area in which changes in land use negatively impact the
   populations. Based on Ripley's K (t) and K (12) analysis, the spatial
   distribution patterns of five populations of C. fuscoviridis were
   studied as follows: (a) the population as a whole (K (t) function); (b)
   by each size class (K (t) function); and (c) between pairs of categories
   (K (12) function). For C. fuscoviridis, the distribution pattern of the
   group of individuals was aggregated. Cluster patterns are related to a
   lack of dispersal and/or indicate places more suitable for cycads.
   Comparison between categories (Ripley's K (12)) indicated that they were
   mainly independent but sometimes dependent and, at certain distances,
   there was inhibition. It is the first record of inhibition in cycads in
   Mexico, suggesting intraspecific competition. The value of Ripley's K
   (t) and K (12) for conservation purpose is discussed. The results of the
   spatial distribution analysis can be applied to restoration strategies
   to facilitate conservation of the species.},

Title = {Population dynamics of the nonnative damselfish Neopomacentrus

Journal = {BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {101},

Abstract = {of nonnative species are known to negatively impact coral reef
   ecosystems. The planktivorous Indo-Pacific damselfish Neopomacentrus
   cyanomos has spread throughout the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) over the past
   decade. However, its population dynamics and potential adverse effects
   on native reef fish communities have not been assessed. Here, we
   examined temporal changes in the occurrence, density, and social-group
   size of N. cyanomos on reefs in the southern GoM and assessed its
   possible impact on native species by (i) modeling the occurrence and
   densities of N. cyanomos and syntopic native fish species and (ii)
   evaluating differences in the species composition of the broader reef
   fish community on the Veracruz reef system (PNSAV) before and after N.
   cyanomos established there. Neopomacentrus cyanomos became more widely
   dispersed and abundant on PNSAV reefs from 2014 to 2021. Between 2006
   and 2013 seven native fishes (four planktivores and three
   nonplanktivores) on PNSAV reefs experienced varying population trends.
   However, from 2014 onwards, populations of those seven species declined,
   although the 162-species PNSAV reef fish community did not exhibit
   notable shifts in species composition. Our results indicate that while
   N. cyanomos has become an increasingly common inhabitant of reefs in the
   southwestern GoM, it has had no measurable impact on native
   planktivorous fishes. Instead, changes in the populations of native
   species are likely related to the increasing habitat degradation of
   reefs immediately adjacent to a large city experiencing expanding
   industrial development. Detailed and mechanistic explorations are
   required to determine if N. cyanomos has negative ecological effects on
   wider Caribbean reefs.},

Title = {Somatic Landscape of Oncogenic Variants Across the Main Cancer Subtypes
   in Latin America: A Narrative Review},
Journal = {JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Variations in somatic genetic alterations can be observed across
   different cancer types and diverse populations. Understanding the
   frequency of oncogenic variants in specific populations helps elucidate
   carcinogenesis and risk factors, with somatic variants often serving as
   treatment markers. Data regarding the somatic landscape across the main
   tumor subtypes in patients from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
   have increased recently, highlighting important differences from
   contrasting populations in North America, Europe, and Asia. Many of
   these differences have pressing implications regarding screening, risk
   factor management, targeted therapies, and health care policy. This
   review aims to synthesize the existing information on somatic oncogenic
   variants in patients' tumors from LAC. We included the frequency of
   somatic oncogenic variants of the most frequent tumors in LAC: prostate
   cancer, female breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and lung
   cancer. Furthermore, we add information from tumors that are relevant in
   LAC because of their high incidence, specific subtypes, or aggressive
   phenotypes, namely gallbladder cancer, acral melanoma, and hematologic
   neoplasms, respectively. The data highlight distinct differences in the
   reported prevalences of various somatic variants across a spectrum of
   neoplasms. Moreover, it demonstrates that an extensive number of genetic
   and molecular studies have been carried out in the region, improving the
   level of characterization for this complex, admixed population.
   Nonetheless, data from many individual countries are still scarce or
   altogether missing, underscoring the need to establish collaborative
   groups to further advance progress in LAC. The need for further
   comprehensive research in the area should not be substituted with data
   from other regions as we seek to empower the choices to improve our
   health care outlook.},

Abstract = {Eleven sponge species from the Las Delicias Formation, Coahuila,
   northern Mexico, are described. Seven are thalamid sponges:
   Amblysiphonella guadalupensis, Guadalupia zitteliana, Lemonea
   cylindrica, Imbricatocoelia paucipera, Discosiphonella mammilosus,
   Girtyocoelia sp., and Colospongia americana. In addition, we report the
   presence of three poriferan taxa: Chaunactis aff. foliata and
   Heliospongia sp. sponges related to Demospongia; and the chaetetid
   Chaetetes mackrothii. For the first time in Paleozoic specimens, in the
   descriptions of Amblysiphonella guadalupensis, the presence of siliceous
   monaxon spicules is reported. The fossils have a high grade of
   diagenesis and chemical replacement of microstructure, possibly in a
   context of high tectonic and diagenetic activity. The described species
   are closely related with others from Grandian localities such as the
   Guadalupe Mountains from Texas and New Mexico, and Mediterranean
   localities. Most abundant species in Las Delicias Formation are
   Amblysiphonella guadalupensis and Lemonea cylindrica, contrasting with
   Texas/New Mexico communities where Guadalupia species prevailed.},

Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {This article provides personal and professional assessments from
   disciples, colleagues and friends of Jaume Porta Casanellas (Barcelona,
   1944; Lleida, 2023), a prominent soil scientist. He began his
   agricultural engineering studies at the Polytechnic University of Madrid
   (UPM) where he met Marta L \& oacute;pez-Acevedo, his wife and
   outstanding collaborator. At UPM, he started his early work in soil
   science under the guidance of Professor Carlos Roquero who became his
   mentor and friend. Jaume Porta was a dedicated, passionate soil
   scientist who engaged extensively in teaching and research in Soil
   Science, while also excelling as a manager. He emerged as a leader due
   to his initiatives in promoting Soil Science in Catalonia and Spain, and
   for his forward-thinking vision, evident in his decisions as Rector of
   the University of Lleida, which have significantly contributed to the
   city's development. From the beginning, he advocated for detailed
   (1:25,000) soil mapping of Catalonia to enhance territorial planning and
   agricultural progress. His primary research focus was on salt-affected
   soils and soils with gypsum, alongside soil erosion and conservation.
   Porta devoted a lot of effort to improve soil field descriptions with
   his Agenda de campo. He played a key role in standardizing soil
   analytical methods, establishing large series laboratories in Spain,
   notably the LAF in Sidamon (Lleida), and aligning Spanish soil labs with
   the international GLOSOLAN network. As president of the SECS, he
   energized activities and encouraged member participation. His
   educational publications, mainly his comprehensive textbook Edafolog \&
   iacute;a, are considered fundamental in Soil Science across
   Spanish-speaking countries, as is the Multilingual Dictionary of Soil
   Science, representing the pinnacle of his efforts to rigorously
   disseminate soil science concepts and terms in Spanish, Catalan,
   Galician, and Portuguese. He contributed significantly to international
   Soil Science courses in Mexico and played a key role in establishing the
   JADE postgraduate training program. He facilitated the creation and
   international visibility of the Spanish Journal of Soil Science.
   Additionally, he advocated for the establishment of the Soil Sciences
   Documentation Centre (Ce.SECS) to preserve historical publications and
   the legacy of soil scientists. Jaume Porta's enduring impact, both
   professionally and personally, will be felt for years to come.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are under constant and increasing environmental stress.
   Symbiotic relationships between coral and dinoflagellates of the family
   Symbiodiniaceae help corals resist stressors and survive. Therefore, it
   is essential to implement conservation and restoration programs that use
   genetic diversity and response mechanisms at the molecular level of
   corals and their symbionts. This study assessed the thermal stress
   response through the expression of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in
   Montastraea cavernosa corals and their symbionts from the Mexican
   Caribbean. We observed variation in the expression level and that corals
   have high HSP70 levels, while symbionts exhibit low HSP70 values.
   Additionally, the ability of the symbiont to acclimatize to thermal
   stress conditions is evident, which may allow the coral to resist
   environmental stressors; a joint response in both host and symbionts can
   also reduce cell damage and prevent bleaching. Detecting and spreading
   stress-resistant organisms can enhance coral reef restoration by
   reducing bleaching, mortality, and promoting adaptive genes.},

Title = {2D Generating Surfaces in a Quartic Hamiltonian System with Three

Abstract = {In previous studies, we developed two techniques aimed at expanding the
   scope of constructing a periodic orbit dividing surface within a
   Hamiltonian system with three or more degrees of freedom. Our approach
   involved extending a periodic orbit into a torus or cylinder, thereby
   elevating it into a higher-dimensional entity within the energy surface
   (see {[}Katsanikas \& Wiggins, 2021a, 2021b, 2023a, 2023b]). Recently,
   we introduced two alternative methods for creating dividing surfaces,
   distinct from the utilization of periodic orbits, by employing 2D
   surfaces (geometric entities) or 3D surfaces within a Hamiltonian system
   with three degrees of freedom (refer to {[}Katsanikas \& Wiggins, 2024a,
   2024b, 2024c]). In these studies, we applied these surfaces in a
   quadratic normal form Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom.
   In this series of two papers, we extend our results to 2D generating
   surfaces for quartic Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom.
   This paper presents the first method of constructing 2D generating
   surfaces.},

Title = {Analysis of Shannon's entropy to contrast between the Embodied and
   Neurocentrist hypothesis of conscious experience},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {246},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We usually accept that consciousness is in the brain. This statement
   corresponds to a Neurocentrist view. However, with all the physical and
   physiological data currently available, a convincing explanation of how
   consciousness emerges has not been given this topic is aborded by Anil
   Seth (2021). Because of this, a natural question arises: Is
   consciousness really in the brain or not? If the answer is no, this
   corresponds to the Embodied perspective. We cannot discriminate between
   these two points of view because we cannot identify how the organism
   processes the information. If we try to measure information processing
   in the brain, then the Neurocentrist view is unavoidable. For example,
   the information integration theory of Tononi's research group and the
   global work area theory developed by Dehaene and Baars, focus solely on
   the brain without considering aspects of Embodied vision (See Tononi,
   2021; Dehaene, 2021). In this article, we propose an index based on
   Shannon's entropy, capable of identifying the leading processing
   elements acting: Are they mainly inner or external? In order to validate
   it, we performed simulations with networks accounting for different
   amounts of internal and outer layers. Since Shannon's entropy is an
   abstract measure of the information content, this index is not dependent
   on the physical network nor the proportion of different layers.
   Therefore, we validate the index as free of bias. This index is a way to
   discriminate between Embodied from Neurocentrist hypotheses.},

Title = {Evaluation of Octopus maya enzyme activity of the digestive gland and

Journal = {BIOLOGY OPEN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As the demand for Octopus maya grows, sustainable farming practices
   become essential to prevent overexploitation, so that farming can be
   developed as a sustainable alternative to traditional fishing.
   Understanding the digestive dynamics of the octopus is essential for
   devising optimal dietary formulations in aquaculture. Despite the
   progress in understanding cephalopod digestion, little is known about
   the specific functioning of the digestive enzymes responsible for
   breaking down protein substrates. This knowledge gap underscores the
   need for further research to support sustainable O. maya population
   management. In this paper, dietary formulations are identified for
   cephalopods by characterizing O. maya digestive enzymes present in the
   digestive gland and gastric juice. The investigation revealed that
   acidic proteases showed a peak activity at higher temperatures than
   alkaline proteases. Inhibitors confirmed the presence of H, L, and D
   cathepsins. The lower activation energy of alkaline enzymes compared to
   acidic ones observed highlights an intriguing aspect of O. maya's
   digestive physiology. This research provides valuable insights into O.
   maya digestive enzyme functions, representing a significant advancement
   in formulating diets crucial for successful octopus farming that may
   help to fully understand its physiology.},

Title = {Life history strategies of two springtails species (Hexapoda:

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Springtails are a very common, widely spread component of soil fauna
   that play a significant role in numerous physical, chemical, and
   biological processes in the soil. Therefore, it is important to
   understand how their evolution and demographic parameters have changed
   throughout time. Since salinity is a relevant condition in the soils
   around the World and particularly in Mexico, the major goal of the
   current research is to understand the life cycle strategies of two
   springtail species from saline soils in Mexico. The studied species are
   Clavisotoma filifera and Brachystomella gabrielae, both widely
   distributed in Mexico, but their development or life history strategies
   are unknown. We found from laboratory cultures that C. filifera had a
   shorter life cycle and a faster reproduction rate than B. gabrielae.
   Nevertheless, both species show the same number of developmental stages,
   but there are interspecific differences in their duration. Although both
   species continuously reproduce throughout the year, the reproductive
   rate is lower in the months that are associated with the dry season at
   the source site. Additionally, we discovered variations in both the size
   and number of eggs in each species. It was found that the species under
   study had various life strategies for growth in the same environment.
   Clavisotoma filifera shows a more r-focused strategy (high fecundity,
   numerous offspring, shorter gestation and faster maturity), B. gabrielae
   shows an opposite strategy, closer to q strategy, with a lower
   fecundity, larger eggs, fewer reproductive events and slower maturity.},

Abstract = {We evaluate the effect of some variables related to fruit morphology,
   tree structure, and forest cover on fruit consumption by birds in the
   tree species Conostegia xalapensis (Melastomataceae) and Bursera
   simaruba (Burseraceae), in a semi-humid forest of southern Mexico.
   Foraging observations were made in 20 trees per species from November
   2020 to June 2021. We recorded a total of 18 and 22 bird species
   consuming the fruits of B. simaruba and C. xalapensis, respectively.
   Flycatchers preferred fruits of B. simaruba, while thrushes largely
   consumed fruits of C. xalapensis. For large birds, crop size and foliar
   height diversity were the most influential variables in the removal of
   B. simaruba fruits, while small birds were positively correlated with
   the foliar coverage. For C. xalapensis, forest cover negatively
   influenced fruit consumption by large birds, while the fruit polar
   diameter had a positive effect on fruit consumption by small birds.
   Fruit consumption of C. xalapensis by specialist birds showed a positive
   relationship with forest cover, while the generalists showed a negative
   relationship. Decreased fruit removal was observed for B. simaruba by
   both specialist and generalist birds in forest landscapes. Our results
   can help understand the drivers of the frugivore-plant relationship in
   semi-humid tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The Sierra Santa Teresa is located 20 km southeast of
   Hermosillo in the central region of Sonora state, Mexico. The
   sedimentary strata mainly correspond to limestone, mudstone, wackestone
   and packstone texture, from the upper Paleozoic. The biota is
   represented by crinoids of the morphospecies Baryschyr anosus,
   Cyclocaudex insaturatus, Floricyclus angustimargo, Cyclocion distictus,
   Lamprosterigma erathense, Preptopremnum rugosum in association with
   algae, fusulinid foraminifera, coralline sponges (Chaetetes sp.),
   solitary corals (Lophophyllidium sp., Fomichevella sp.), fenestellid
   bryozoans (Archimedes stoyanowi), and brachiopods (Antiquatonia sp.).
   Objective: The principal aim of this study is to analyze the biotic
   composition in the Sierra Santa Teresa and its paleoecological and
   paleogeographical considerations. Methods: In this study we synthetize
   information about the principal taxa collected in outcrops of the
   Carboniferous of the Sierra, Santa Teresa. Results: The distribution of
   the biota, and particularly the crinoid morphospecies, allowed
   paleobiogeographical correlations to be made with other
   Mississippian-Pennsylvanian localities of Mexico and different regions
   of the United States of America in Texas, Colorado, Illinois and
   Oklahoma, which were located in the southwestern of the North American
   Craton. Conclusions: It is considered that the paleoenvironment inferred
   based on the paleontological records of the Sierra Santa Teresa were
   shallow seas that allowed the development of communities of crinoids, as
   well as other invertebrates such as coralline sponges, solitary corals,
   fenestellid bryozoans and brachiopods, with a range stratigraphic from
   the Middle-Upper Mississippian (Chesterian) to the Middle Pennsylvanian
   (Desmoinesian).},

Abstract = {Springtails (Collembola) inhabit soils from the Arctic to the Antarctic
   and comprise an estimated similar to 32\% of all terrestrial arthropods
   on Earth. Here, we present a global, spatially-explicit database on
   springtail communities that includes 249,912 occurrences from 44,999
   samples and 2,990 sites. These data are mainly raw sample-level records
   at the species level collected predominantly from private archives of
   the authors that were quality-controlled and taxonomically-standardised.
   Despite covering all continents, most of the sample-level data come from
   the European continent (82.5\% of all samples) and represent four
   habitats: woodlands (57.4\%), grasslands (14.0\%), agrosystems (13.7\%)
   and scrublands (9.0\%). We included sampling by soil layers, and across
   seasons and years, representing temporal and spatial within-site
   variation in springtail communities. We also provided data use and
   sharing guidelines and R code to facilitate the use of the database by
   other researchers. This data paper describes a static version of the
   database at the publication date, but the database will be further
   expanded to include underrepresented regions and linked with trait data.},

Title = {Fish assemblage structure related to habitat heterogeneity in rocky

Journal = {NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {One of the major paradigms in ecology is the understanding of processes
   and patterns related to the structure of biological communities. Reef
   ecosystems, with their high productivity, habitat heterogeneity, and
   fish diversity provide a model for studying these processes. We sampled
   four sites three times during the season associated with the California
   Current and two times associated with the North Equatorial Current using
   video-transects on the coast of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, Mexico to
   determine the relationship between the habitat characteristics and the
   structure of the fish assemblage. We recorded a total of 26 families and
   54 species and estimated fish richness and abundance. In addition to
   measuring local water variables such as temperature (degrees C),
   salinity (PPT), pH and dissolved oxygen (O2\%), we determined habitat
   heterogeneity by processing photographs of the substrate and calculated
   rugosity using the tape chain. Oxygen and temperature were the variables
   associated to sea water conditions that differentiated the sampled
   sites. The fish community structure presented high correlations with
   temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, followed by the
   heterogeneity components such as rugosity and substrate diversity. Our
   results showed that seasonal changes in water conditions and physical
   components in the coast of Zihuatanejo promotes changes in the fish
   community.},

Abstract = {The problem of semantics concerns the way in which society is described
   and, therefore, how the selected is actualized. From the General Theory
   of Social Systems, the question is approached through the
   structure/semantics difference. The questions that constitute the
   research address this relationship, or more precisely, the
   correspondence (or not) between social evolution and the evolution of
   ideas. The aim is to answer the questions of in what kind of order and
   social structures is the concept of childhood produced and stabilized?
   and, in turn, to what extent do these semantics guide the experiences
   and expectations of the structures to which they refer? Based on this
   case, the conditions of possibility of consolidation for a cultivated
   semantics (concept/word difference) unfold through three structural
   conditions: the differentiation between psychic systems and social
   systems, the systemic differentiation of society by functions, and the
   decoupling between self- reference and binary schemata.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {103},

Abstract = {Ctenophores are one of the least known invertebrate phyla in Mexico,
   especially the benthic forms in which studies are incomplete and
   infrequent, lacking information about their ecology and diversity. As
   part of the environmental monitoring project `Biodiversidad Marina de
   Yucatan' conducted in the southern Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Caribbean
   Sea, the benthic ctenophore Vallicula multiformis (Coeloplanidae) was
   identified in association with green algae in the southern Gulf of
   Mexico, and on an autonomous reef monitoring structure in the Mexican
   Caribbean Sea. This finding represents the first record of the
   occurrence of a benthic ctenophore species in Mexican waters. We provide
   morphological characteristics of V. multiformis in both reef areas.
   Recording this species increases the known number of Mexican ctenophore
   fauna from 33 to 34 taxa and represents baseline information for the
   continuous study of the ecology and diversity of benthic ctenophores in
   Mexico.},

Title = {Benthic mollusc communities across space and through time in a

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {290},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The coast of the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) has undergone numerous
   changes over the last century as a result of population growth, shifts
   in land use, establishment of industries, and storm impacts. To
   understand how the mollusc fauna responded to these changes over time,
   paleoecological studies were conducted to compare historical and modern
   data, and to reveal information on past environmental conditions. We
   analyzed mollusc assemblages in sediment cores from Rio Lagartos coastal
   lagoon, which span the last similar to 70 years. Mollusc assemblages in
   the sediment cores were compared to a modern inventory of Mollusca
   fauna, which was compiled to assess species distributions associated
   with multiple environmental variables. Mollusc assemblages from the
   sediment cores (17,089 specimens), which represent 19 bivalve and 43
   gastropod species, and modern inventory datasets possess the same
   ubiquitous species and the same feeding guilds, i.e., groups that
   exploit the same food resources. Nearly twice as many species were
   identified in the sediment cores as in the modern inventory. This
   finding probably reflects the fact that the mollusc community changed
   through time at the core sites in response to shifting environmental
   conditions. Nevertheless, we encountered a number of taxa in the modern
   survey samples, which were absent from the sediment cores. This was
   probably a consequence of the limited spatial coverage of the cores and
   small diameter of the core barrels, which precluded sampling of large
   taxa. We report differences in mollusc abundance and taxonomic
   composition in the cores across space and time, which may be related to
   salinity changes in the lagoon and modifications of the nearby
   terrestrial environment.},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {For each separable space X, we consider the family of all countable
   dense sets of X modulo an equivalence relation defined as follows: we
   say that M \& SIM; N if and only if there is a homeomorphism h : X \&
   RARR; X such that h{[}M] = N. The countable dense homogeneity degree of
   X is defined as the cardinality of the set of the equivalence classes
   under the relation \& SIM;. In case such degree equals 1, the space is
   said to be countable dense homogeneous. Countable dense homogeneity has
   become a classical concept and has been studied with interest in the
   last decades. In this paper we present a full characterization of the
   countable dense homogeneity degree for the class of dendrites.\& COPY;

Title = {Preventable risk factors for type 2 diabetes can be detected using

Abstract = {Given the ever-increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity, the
   pressure on global healthcare is expected to be colossal, especially in
   terms of blindness. Electroretinogram (ERG) has long been perceived as a
   first-use technique for diagnosing eye diseases, and some studies
   suggested its use for preventable risk factors of type 2 diabetes and
   thereby diabetic retinopathy (DR). Here, we show that in a non-evoked
   mode, ERG signals contain spontaneous oscillations that predict disease
   cases in rodent models of obesity and in people with overweight,
   obesity, and metabolic syndrome but not yet diabetes, using one single
   random forest-based model. Classification performance was both
   internally and externally validated, and correlation analysis showed
   that the spontaneous oscillations of the non-evoked ERG are altered
   before oscillatory potentials, which are the current gold-standard for
   early DR. Principal component and discriminant analysis suggested that
   the slow frequency (0.4-0.7 Hz) components are the main discriminators
   for our predictive model. In addition, we established that the optimal
   conditions to record these informative signals, are 5-minute duration
   recordings under daylight conditions, using any ERG sensors, including
   ones working with portative, non-mydriatic devices. Our study provides
   an early warning system with promising applications for prevention,
   monitoring and even the development of new therapies against type 2
   diabetes.},

Title = {Bioinformatics-based Characterization of the Sequence Variability of
   Zika Virus Polyprotein and Envelope Protein (E)},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Zika virus, which is widely spread and infects humans
   through the bites of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti female
   mosquitoes, represents a serious global health issue. Objective: The
   objective of the present study is to computationally characterize Zika
   virus polyproteins (UniProt Name: PRO\_0000443018 {[}residues 1-3423],
   PRO\_0000445659 {[}residues 1-3423] and PRO\_0000435828 {[}residues
   1-3419]) and their envelope proteins using their physico-chemical
   properties. Methods: To achieve this, the Polarity Index Method (PIM)
   profile and the Protein Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition (PIDP) profile
   of 3 main groups of proteins were evaluated: structural proteins
   extracted from specific Databases, Zika virus polyproteins, and their
   envelope proteins (E) extracted from UniProt Database. Once the PIM
   profile of the Zika virus envelope proteins (E) was obtained and since
   the Zika virus polyproteins were also identified with this profile, the
   proteins defined as ``reviewed proteins{''} extracted from the UniProt
   Database were searched for the similar PIM profile. Finally, the
   difference between the PIM profiles of the Zika virus polyproteins and
   their envelope proteins (E) was tested using 2 non-parametric
   statistical tests. Results: It was found and tested that the PIM profile
   is an efficient discriminant that allows obtaining a ``computational
   fingerprint{''} of each Zika virus polyprotein from its envelope protein
   (E). Conclusion: PIM profile represents a computational tool, which can
   be used to effectively discover Zika virus polyproteins from Databases,
   from their envelope proteins (E) sequences.},

Title = {Sleep loss and addiction},
Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Reducing sleep hours is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular,
   metabolic, and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, previous studies have
   shown that reduction in sleep time is a factor that favors relapse in
   addicted patients. Additionally, animal models have demonstrated that
   both sleep restriction and sleep deprivation in-crease the preference
   for alcohol, methylphenidate, and the self-administration of cocaine.
   Therefore, the present review discusses current knowledge about the
   influence of sleep hours reduction on addictivebehaviors; likewise, we
   discuss the neuronal basis underlying the sleep reduction-addiction
   relationship, like the role of the orexin and dopaminergic system and
   neuronal plasticity (i.e., delta FosB expression). Potentially, chronic
   sleep re-striction could increase brain vulnerability and promote
   addictive behavior.},

Abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most worrisome infectious bacteria
   due to its intrinsic and acquired resistance against several antibiotics
   and the recalcitrance of its infections; hence, the development of novel
   antimicrobials effective against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa is
   mandatory. In this work, silver nanoparticles obtained by green
   synthesis using a leaf extract and fungi were tested against a battery
   of clinical strains from cystic fibrosis, pneumonia and burnt patients,
   some of them with multidrug resistance. Both nanoparticles showed a
   potent antibacterial effect, causing severe damage to the cell wall,
   membrane and DNA, and inducing the production of reactive oxygen
   species. Moreover, the nanoparticles derived from fungi showed
   synergistic antibacterial effects with the antibiotics meropenem and
   levofloxacin for some clinical strains and both kinds of nanoparticles
   were nontoxic for larvae of the moth Galleria mellonella, encouraging
   further research for their implementation in the treatment of P.
   aeruginosa infections.},

Abstract = {The is aim of this study was to evaluate if vitamin E supplementation to
   diet could improve the spermatic quantity and quality in males of
   Litopenaeus vannamei. A basal diet with 171.5 mg/kg (included in
   commercial vitamin premix) and experimental diets with 3 concentrations
   of vitamin E: 620 (diet A), 1069 (diet B) and 1517 (diet C) mg/kg were
   tested by 30 days. 500 L tanks were set up for each treatment, and seven
   males were set in each tank. Circulant cholesterol, triglyceride (TG),
   glucose, total protein was measured. Sperm quantity and quality were
   classified as normal, abnormal, or dead. In reproductive tract was
   measured the activity and differential expression lipid soluble
   antioxidant system (LSAS) and of immune genes system. The higher sperm
   quantity was obtained in A diet and decreased in shrimp fed B and C
   diets (p < 0.05). Males fed diets B and C presented a higher activity
   and relative expression of lipid system oy suggesting oxidative stress.
   A significant increment of prophenol oxidase (proFo) and
   alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha-2 M) transcripts were observed in males fed
   C diet (p < 0.05). All these variables were present in males with low
   sperm amount and low hemocyanin gene expression (p < 0.05). Therefore,
   diet A supplemented with 620 mg/kg vitamin E could benefit males L.

   Pine-Oak forest (Z), Agricultural (V), Erosion (E), Mine (M), in Sierra
   Nevada (Tepetlaoxtoc, Mexico), in order to know their relationship with
   both physical and chemical parameters, and also their potential as
   bioindicators, using the values of the QBS-ar index, in stony mining
   areas. A positive and significant relationship was found with the
   abundance and moisture and organic matter percentages. Groups described
   as bioindicators, hyperparasitoids and predators were identified in
   sites with more conservation than those with greater degradation. The
   QBS-ar index values were higher in the area B. Three zones, B, M and E,
   were identified, according by their suitability for ecological
   rehabilitation action. The potential of soil microarthropods to be
   integrated into management programs and conservation and rehabilitation
   strategies in areas of stone mining was recognized.},

Title = {The thermal tolerance of a tropical population of blue crab
   (Callinectes sapidus) modulates aerobic metabolism during hypoxia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The blue crab Callinectes sapidus is a widespread ectothermic species
   that supports large fisheries. Physiology of temperate and subtropical
   populations of blue crabs are well studied; however, a lack of
   information exists on tropical populations. Given the low locomotion
   capabilities of C. sapidus adult blue crabs, natural selection should
   favor traits that shape a particular thermal niche reflected through
   tolerance modulation to dissolved oxygen (DO). This study was designed
   to evaluate the thermal window and hypoxia sensitivity of the blue crab
   population in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The effect of acclimation
   temperatures from 20 degrees C to 34 degrees C on thermal preference
   (TP), critical thermal limits (CT), and thermal metabolic scope (TMS)
   was assessed in normoxia. Metabolic rate regulation over oxygen partial
   pressure (pO(2)) gradient was evaluated through oxygen consumption
   measurements at different degrees of acute hypoxia. Callinectes sapidus
   was observed tending to specialize towards higher temperatures, showing
   a mean TP from 26 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The lowest performance of
   aerobic pathways was observed at the coldest regimes and the highest at
   the warmest ones with mean TMS value being 35 \% greater at 34 degrees C
   than 20 degrees C. Patterns for metabolic regulation were dependent on
   the interaction between environmental temperature and DO, in which the
   interval from 29 degrees C to 34 degrees C provoked a 50 \% reduction in
   oxygen consumption when exposed to similar to 20\% air saturation
   levels. The results obtained showed that blue crabs distributed in the
   southern Gulf of Mexico could be close to their oxygen-temperature
   tolerance limits, which has important implications when climate change
   effects on species re-distribution is considered.},

Abstract = {The common snook (C. undecimalis) is a highly valuable commercial and
   sport fishing species in marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats.
   Despite its abundance in freshwater ecosystems, the information on the
   reproductive biology comes mainly from studies in the marine habitat. In
   this work, the reproductive cycle at the gametogenic and hormonal level
   is addressed in specimens captured in contrasting environments
   interconnected by the Grijalva-Usumacinta fluvial system. Adult common
   snook presented a similar temporal pattern in sex steroid concentrations
   in both environments. Likewise, females and males were observed
   undergoing advanced maturity simultaneously in both environments.
   However, females in the freshwater environment did not reach final
   maturation, and no post-ovulatory follicles were found, indicating that
   spawn did not happen. Therefore, organisms are synchronized with gonads
   developing in both habitats, implying migrations of at least 300 km from
   the freshwater environment to the spawning grounds in the Gulf of
   Mexico.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Use of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS)
   for Describing the Species Diversity of Two Coral Reefs in the Yucatan
   Peninsula, Mexico},

Abstract = {Autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) have been proposed as a
   standardized, passive, nondestructive sampling tool. This study assessed
   the ability of ARMS to capture the cryptic species diversity of two
   coral reefs by recording species richness and taxonomic
   representativeness using conventional taxonomy. The capacity of ARMS, as
   artificial substrates, to favor the establishment of nonindigenous
   species over native species was also evaluated. The use of ARMS allowed
   the detection of 370 species morphotypes from nine phyla, yielding 13
   new records of geographic distribution expansion, one exotic species for
   the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and six newly described
   species. It was also possible to make spatial comparisons of species
   richness between both reefs. ARMS captured cryptic diversity
   exceptionally well, with the exception of echinoderms. Furthermore,
   these artificial structures did not hinder the colonization ability of
   native species; in fact, the colonization patterns on the structures
   themselves represented the spatial differences in the structure of
   benthic assemblages. This study represents the first effort to make a
   conventional taxonomic description of the cryptic fauna of the Yucatan
   Peninsula using ARMS. It is recommended to assess coral reef species
   diversity, but more taxonomists specialized in marine invertebrates are
   needed.},

Title = {Testing competing hypotheses about the behaviour of floral visitors in
   mixed-flower stands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {158-169},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. Plants occur in mixed stands and flower simultaneously. Most
   hypotheses about how flowers affect the visitation rates of conspecific
   or heterospecific neighbours involve attractiveness. Attractive flowers
   are thought to monopolise visitors, but also to act as magnets
   increasing visits to unattractive neighbours. Attractiveness may be
   density-dependent: Visitors could profit from focusing on abundant
   species, sometimes forming search images that make rare flowers less
   detectable. 2. We tested four hypotheses using data on visitation rates
   by honeybees (Apis melifera) and bee flies (Bombyliidae) to 1072 stands
   comprising six plant species in different densities. Hypotheses were
   compared through multi-model inference using the disc equation (a
   functional response model) modified for co-flowering species and
   density-dependent attractiveness. 3. We found that the most attractive
   flowers had attributes (colour, position, mobility) that elicit strong
   responses in the sensory apparatus of each type of visitor. 4.
   Attractiveness usually increased with conspecific floral density,
   indicating that visitors focus on abundant species. The most attractive
   flowers strongly reduced the attractiveness of their neighbours,
   reinforcing visitor monopolisation. However, mildly attractive species
   increased the attractiveness of less alluring flowers, acting as
   magnets. 5. In bombyliids, flowers increased the attractiveness of
   same-coloured heterospecifics but reduced it when colours differed,
   suggesting search-image formation. The results were similar for both
   types of visitors but were weaker and less consistent in honeybees. This
   suggests that Apis behaviour is not as rapidly adjusted to local
   densities as that of bombyliids, perhaps because of longer-term memory
   or a strong role of sociality in determining individual behaviour.},

Title = {The pollination of the gynomonoecious Bdallophytum oxylepis
   (Cytinaceae, Malvales)},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Bdallophytum oxylepis is a rare and endemic species belonging to the
   Cytinaceae family, a root holoparasitic plant in which most resources
   are allocated to attracting pollinators. This species is gynomonoecious
   with intraindividual variation in flower size and sex. Moreover, the
   flowers exhibit sapromyophilous traits, as do other species of
   Bdallophytum. Firstly, this study aimed to determine whether all floral
   morphs can form seeds and be pollen donors (in the case of bisexual
   flowers). Secondly, as this species has floral traits hypothesized to
   adapt to particular types of pollen vectors (carrion flies), we also
   studied the pollination of B. oxylepis to confirm whether the syndromes
   correspond to what occurs in nature. Through pollination treatments, we
   determined that all floral morphs are functional. By monitoring the
   inflorescences, we found that pollination is specialized in the studied
   population. Stingless bees performed pollination, as they have a high
   visitation rate, frequency, and constancy, and they are unique visitors
   that deposit pollen on the stigmas. Thus, they appear to be effective
   pollinators rather than carrion flies, as predicted by the syndrome. As
   shown here, animal-plant interaction studies can help establish a basis
   for conserving rare species such as holoparasites. Moreover, knowledge
   about the reproductive aspects of B. oxylepis reveals essential clues
   about its life cycle and role in maintaining native pollinators with
   economic and cultural value, such as stingless bees.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Peritrichs usually settle on the external surface and gills of
   crustaceans. However, their physiological effect on the host has not
   been studied. Respiratory rate is a susceptible index for some factors
   that affect an organism. To test if ciliates attached to the crustacean
   gills have a physiological effect, we measured crustacean oxygen
   consumption in a closed system. Crayfish Cambarellus (Cambarellus)
   montezumae were collected in Lago Xochimilco in Mexico City and were
   isolated in chambers. Two peritrich species, Cothurnia variabilis
   (32.5\%) and Epistylis gammari (67.5\%), were observed on the gills. The
   metabolic rate was evaluated by oxygen consumption with a polarimetric
   oximeter. Statistical analyses demonstrated that a density of ciliates
   attached to the gills of the crayfish above similar to 50 individuals
   increased oxygen consumption with a positive correlation to epibiont
   density. We conclude that C. variabilis and E. gammari ciliate epibionts
   attached to the gill of the crayfish Cambarellus (Cambarellus)
   montezumae cause an increase in metabolic rate.},

Abstract = {A dynamic model to study shear vertical waves in laminated coupled
   electro-mechanical materials is proposed. The mechanical imperfections
   at the interface between two materials or phases that constitute an
   heterogeneous medium are considered. The behavior of vertical transverse
   waves is analyzed by considering two types of imperfect contact. On the
   one hand, imperfect contact is taken into account through the motion of
   layers in the perpendicular direction to the interface. On the other
   hand, imperfect contact is considered through the motion of layers in a
   tangential direction to the interface. The layers are coupled through a
   spring obeying Hooke's law. The degree of imperfection is incorporated
   through the magnitude of the spring's elastic constant in both
   scenarios. The stress is proportional to the jump of the displacement
   vector at the layer interface and to the magnitude of the spring's
   elastic constant. Dispersion relations for different volumetric
   fractions of the piezoelectric phase and different degrees of
   imperfection are obtained. Crossover regions are observed in the
   dispersion curves. Changes in the oscillation modes could be identified
   through the material displacements in these regions. Displacements
   within the composite material, used to describe the nature of the
   oscillations, are illustrated in some cases. Additionally, the perfect
   contact case is reproduced by solving the proposed model for large
   values of the spring's elastic constant, showing a good agreement when
   compared with the solutions to models proposed by other authors. A
   comparison between theory and experimental results for the
   electromechanical coupling factor is presented. Finally, the
   experimental data for the coupling factor can be better explained by
   including the degree of imperfection through the model proposed in this
   work.},

Title = {Exploring the effects of warming seas by using the optimal and pejus
   temperatures of the embryo of three Octopoda species in the Gulf of
   Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Using data related to thermal optimal and pejus of the embryos of
   Octopus americanus from Brazil and O. insularis and O. maya from Mexico,
   this study aimed to project the potential distribution areas in the Gulf
   of Mexico and predict distribution shifts under different Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 6 and 8.5) for the years 2050 and
   2100. The different thermal tolerances elicited different responses to
   current and future scenarios. In this sense, O. insularis and O. maya
   thermal niches stretch from the Caribbean to Florida. Nevertheless, O.
   insularis may inhabit warmer areas than O. maya. Surprisingly, no area
   was considered thermally habitable for O. americanus, which could have
   been associated with the use of data of populations thermally adapted to
   temperate conditions south of Brazil. According to models, a warming
   scenario would cause a restriction of the available thermal niche of O.
   maya, while O. insularis could expand under RCP 6 scenarios. This
   restriction was more substantial in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Nevertheless,
   under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the temperature in 2100 may negatively
   affect even O. insularis, the species most thermal tolerant. If our
   results are accurate, the fishing yield of O. insularis will increase in
   the future, replacing the heavily exploited O. maya in the coasts of the
   southern Gulf of Mexico. Regarding O. americanus, no inference might be
   made until thermal tolerances of locally adapted populations can be
   studied.},

Title = {Using realized thermal niche to validate thermal preferences from
   laboratory studies. How do they stand?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Temperature is recongnised as the main factor controlling the species
   fitness and performance. Naturally, the thermal preferences (TP) of
   aquatic organisms obtained in controlled conditions have been used to
   relate physiological performance with field data since they are a good
   proxy to the fundamental niche. Literature suggests that dispersal
   capabilities, biological interactions, acclimatisation, adaptation,
   among others might play a role in species distribution; thus, in
   reality, species are usually occupying a realized thermal niche (RTN).
   Therefore, this study was designed to inquire into the following
   questions: Are the TP of tropical aquatic ec-totherms found in
   laboratory conditions similar to their RTN? Can TP be validated with
   occurrences in the wild? To answer these questions, this study compared
   the TP obtained from previously published works with the RTN of the
   crabs Callinectes similis and C. sapidus, the fishes Centropomus
   undecimalis and Ocyurus chrysurus, the lobster Panulirus argus, and the
   octopus Octopus maya obtained from occurrences from 1693documents. When
   RTN values were tested against the TPs obtained in laboratory, no
   significant differences were found for fish species (P > 0.05); in
   contrast, differences for the benthic invertebrates were reported (P <
   0.05). At least two factors could have been affecting these results:
   differences in the average tolerances between geographically distinct
   populations (local adaptation) and the dispersal capabilities that might
   have been forcing a differentiation between populations If, as proposed,
   fishes can actively follow thermal optimum, their response to warming
   scenarios could be faster than benthic organisms. If our hypothesis is
   true, the uncertainty of climate change could be reduced when the local
   adaptation is taking into consideration.},

   open problems in the field of robotics. Application areas include

   In this survey article, we start by providing a tutorial on foundational
   aspects of models of shape and shape dynamics. We then use this as the
   basis for a review of existing work on learning and estimation of these
   models and on motion planning and control to achieve desired
   deformations. We also discuss potential future lines of work.},

Journal = {TOPOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {281},
Number = {SI},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Let S be a topological property of sequences (such as, for example, ``to
   contain a convergent subsequence{''} or ``to have an accumulation
   point{''}). We introduce the following open-point game OP(X,S) on a
   topological space X. In the nth move, Player O chooses a non-empty open
   set U-n subset of X, and Player P responds by selecting a point x(n) is
   an element of U-n. Player P wins the game if the sequence \{x(n) : n is
   an element of N\} satisfies property S in X; otherwise, Player O wins.
   The (non-)existence of regular or stationary winning strategies in OP(X,
   S) for both players defines new compactness properties of the underlying
   space X. We thoroughly investigate these properties and construct
   examples distinguishing half of them, for an arbitrary property S
   sandwiched between sequential compactness and countable compactness. (C)

Title = {Synchronization of the circadian clock by time-restricted feeding with
   progressive increasing calorie intake. Resemblances and differences

Abstract = {Circadian rhythms are the product of the interaction of molecular clocks
   and environmental signals, such as light-dark cycles and eating-fasting
   cycles. Several studies have demonstrated that the circadian rhythm of
   peripheral clocks, and behavioural and metabolic mediators are
   re-synchronized in rodents fed under metabolic challenges, such as
   hyper- or hypocaloric diets and subjected to time-restricted feeding
   protocols. Despite the metabolic challenge, these approaches improve the
   metabolic status, raising the enquiry whether removing progressively the
   hypocaloric challenge in a time-restricted feeding protocol leads to
   metabolic benefits by the synchronizing effect. To address this issue,
   we compared the effects of two time-restricted feeding protocols, one
   involved hypocaloric intake during the entire protocol (HCT) and the
   other implied a progressive intake accomplishing a normocaloric intake
   at the end of the protocol (NCT) on several behavioural, metabolic, and
   molecular rhythmic parameters. We observed that the food anticipatory
   activity (FAA) was driven and maintained in both HCT and NCT.
   Resynchronization of hepatic molecular clock, free fatty acids (FFAs),
   and FGF21 was elicited closely by HCT and NCT. We further observed that
   the fasting cycles involved in both protocols promoted ketone body
   production, preferentially beta-hydroxybutyrate in HCT, whereas
   acetoacetate was favoured in NCT before access to food. These findings
   demonstrate that time-restricted feeding does not require a sustained
   calorie restriction for promoting and maintaining the synchronization of
   the metabolic and behavioural circadian clock, and suggest that
   metabolic modulators, such as FFAs and FGF21, could contribute to FAA
   expression.},

Abstract = {Particle size distributions in the 10-400 nm diameter size range were
   measured at a site south of Mexico City, during 30 non-consecutive days
   from October to December 2016 using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer,
   together with meteorological parameters and criteria pollutants
   concentration. Particles were classified into three modes depending on
   their diameter: (D) over bar (p) <= 20 nm (M-1, nucleation mode), 20 >
   (D) over bar (p) > 100 nm (M-2, Aitken mode), and (D) over bar (p) > 100
   nm (M-3, accumulation mode) to describe their concentration variability
   and discuss its connection with meteorology and atmospheric chemistry.
   In general, M-1 and M-3 concentrations showed maximum variability during
   the sampling period and were linearly anticorrelated. Concentrations of
   M-3, black carbon, and PM2.5 showed a similar trend, which indicates
   that M-3 represents the largest fraction of the particle mass
   concentration. The concentration fraction of M-2 was relatively
   constant. The three modes showed a primary character during peak traffic
   hours in the morning; M-2 also showed an important secondary character
   during the hours of highest photochemical activity. We only observed one
   nucleation event, which coincided with an unusually high concentration
   of SO2. On the other hand, we identified several days with typical
   condensational growth behavior at noon, and sometimes in the afternoon,
   associated with the highest values of O-3, SO2, NO2, and PM2.5
   concentrations, as well as of radiation and temperature.},

Abstract = {Nests of ants in the Ponerinae subfamily harbor a rich diversity of
   invertebrate commensals that maintain a range of interactions which are
   still poorly known in the Neotropical Region. This study aims to
   investigate the diversity of these invertebrates in nests of several
   species of the genus Neoponera and search for possible differences in
   their commensal fauna composition in two distinct habitats: the
   understory and the ground level of cocoa tree plantations. From March to
   December, 2017, nests of Neoponera spp. were collected through
   inspection of different substrates in a cocoa tree plantation. We
   compared the composition of the assemblage of commensal invertebrates
   according to the environment stratum, the substrate of nesting and the
   species of Neoponera. Twenty-one nests of four species were collected:
   N. apicalis (1), N. curvinodis (1), N. inversa (3) and N. verenae (16).
   The invertebrates recorded in the nests of the ants belong to the
   following taxa - Mollusca: Gastropoda; Annelida: Haplotaxida; Arachnida:
   Acari, Araneae, Opiliones, Pseudoscorpionida; Chilopoda:
   Scolopendromorpha; Collembola: Entomobryomorpha, Poduromorpha;
   Hemiptera; Psocoptera; Hymenoptera; Diptera; and Coleoptera. Nests of
   Neoponera harbor a large variety of commensals, such as previously
   unknown species of Collembola in the genera Cyphoderus, Friesea and
   other Poduromorpha. Differences regarding the diversity of these
   invertebrates between the two strata were highlighted.},

Abstract = {Intermediate filaments (IFs) represent a major cytoskeletal network
   contributing to force transmission, cell shape and structure, adhesion
   and motility, subcellular scaffolding and tissue resilience, thereby
   modulating a range of cellular activities. Life-threatening disorders
   associated with IF mutations have pushed investigations to study IFs of
   mammalian cells in culture and in vivo. Keratin and Lamin related
   disorders, Desmin-related myopathy, Muscular Dystrophies, Alexander
   disease are just examples of pathologies related to IFs. Synemin, a type
   IV IF has become a target for research since its AKAP role in the heart
   was reported. Here we summarize our results with Synemin ``knock-out{''}
   mice showing that Synemin plays a significant role in skeletal and
   cardiac muscle, leading to a mild skeletal myopathy and a mixed
   cardiomyopathy. We also report an important role of Synemin, with the
   absence of Synemin leading to osteopenia.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the community structure of edaphic oribatid mites
   from the tropical forest at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, showing its monthly
   variation during only one year, considering two contrasting tree species
   and their relation with abiotic edaphic parameters. Randomly, five
   Astrocaryum mexicanum and Guarea glabra plants were chosen and near the
   stem of each one, a sample of soil was taken and processed in the same
   biological station with Berlese-Tullgren funnels. The most abundant
   families were Scheloribatidae, Oppiidae, Xylobatidae, Arceremaeidae, and
   Galumnidae. The Kruskall-Wallis test showed that structure of oribatid
   mite community is not significative related to tree identity, which they
   are associated. Pearson's multiple correlation showed that the edaphic
   temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors in the
   structuring of oribatid mites communities. The abiotic variables
   explained 58\% of oribatid community variance in its first two axes,
   with temporality and CO2 being the factors with most influence over the
   community. It is concluded that tree identity is not a factor that
   affects the structuring of oribatid mite communities in this tropical
   forest, while temporality, soil temperature and CO2 are the factors that
   most influence its establishment, this last factor as an indirect
   indicator of system productivity.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a large increase in the amount of
   experimental evidence for diverse archaeal organisms, and these findings
   allow for a comprehensive analysis of archaeal genetic organization.
   However, studies about regulatory mechanisms in this cellular domain are
   still limited. In this context, we identified a repertoire of 86
   DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) in the archaeon Pyrococcus
   furiosus DSM 3638, that are clustered into 32 evolutionary families. In
   structural terms, 45\% of these proteins are composed of one structural
   domain, 41\% have two domains, and 14\% have three structural domains.
   The most abundant DNA-binding domain corresponds to the winged
   helix-turn-helix domain; with few alternative DNA-binding domains. We
   also identified seven regulons, which represent 13.5\% (279 genes) of
   the total genes in this archaeon. These analyses increase our knowledge
   about gene regulation in P. furiosus DSM 3638 and provide additional
   clues for comprehensive modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks
   in the Archaea cellular domain.},

Title = {Habitat preferences in freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates: Algae as
   substratum and food resource in high mountain rivers from Mexico},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {10-17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems is closely
   related to the availability and heterogeneity of habitats. These
   habitats may be of inorganic origin, such as the rocky substratum
   associated with the river bed, or organic such as macroscopic algae. The
   objective of this study was to determinate the importance of five
   species of algae that differ in their morphological type as a substratum
   and food resource regarding the associated establishment of
   macroinvertebrate assemblages taking account the climatic seasonality
   (warm dry, cool dry and rainy). We then evaluate the differences in
   macroinvertebrates assemblages with respect to the inorganic substratum
   by sampling high mountain rivers in central Mexico. The mucilaginous
   colonies of Nostoc parmelioides and Placoma regulare, the
   pseudoparenchymatous bambusiform thallus of Paralemanea mexicana and the
   laminate thallus of Prasiola mexicana had the highest densities of
   macroinvertebrates, represented by the genera Cricotopus, Paramerina,
   Simulium and Tanytarsini tribe. The relationship between algal
   morphological type and the richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates
   was positively related to specific conductivity, total dissolved solids
   and discharge variables. The dominant taxa associated with the inorganic
   substratum belonged mainly to the Trichoptera, Diptera and Ephemeroptera
   orders. Water temperature, discharge and concentration of
   orthophosphates were the main environmental variables able to explain
   the diversity of macroinvertebrates on this substratum. The dominance of
   detritivorous macroinvertebrates in these mountain rivers suggests the
   contribution of allochthonous organic matter possibly of anthropogenic
   origin. The assemblages of macroinvertebrates on inorganic substratum
   did not significantly differ among sites or climatic seasons.},

   AFFECT THE COLLEMBOLA COMMUNITY?},
Journal = {APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {4357-4373},
Abstract = {The abundance of Collembola families were studied in three localities
   with four different land-use types: forest, agroforestry, grassland and
   corn crop, all located in the Santa Marta Range, Los Tuxtlas Biosphere
   Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico. Samples of litter and soil were collected in
   each land use during the dry season, February and March 2005, and
   processed by Berlese-Tullgren funnels. In addition, physical and
   chemical parameters of soil were measured. A nested MANOVA was applied
   to evaluate land-use and site effect on edaphic parameters, and a nested
   ANOVA was used to evaluate their effect on the Collembola abundance. In
   addition to this, a Cluster Analysis (CA) and Canonical Correspondence
   Analysis (CCA) were used. Besides, Shannon diversity index was
   calculated. A total of 1,088 collembolans from seven families were
   gathered, with the most abundant being Isotomidae, Entomobryidae and
   Hypogastruridae. The nested MANOVA and ANOVA revealed significant effect
   of the site and land-use on the soil parameters and Collembola
   abundance, respectively. CA formed two main groups based mainly on sites
   and biotopes. The CCA, showed that abundance of Onychiuridae and
   Odontellidae are related with altitude, Na and Cation Exchange Capacity
   (CEC). Diversity was higher in forest than in corn crop and grassland.
   The corn crop showed a higher incidence of Isotomidae and Entomobryidae
   than the other sites. Thus, the changes in the Collembola community at
   family level can be useful to recognize the quality of soil in different
   land uses.},

Abstract = {Several populations of a non-tapering and tapering, fasciculated, single
   and geminate false branching heterocytous cyanobacterium were collected
   from rocky shores in the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. The
   populations were provisionally placed in Brasilonema based on
   morphology, but upon sequencing of both environmental and culture
   material it was discovered that the populations/cultures belonged to the
   Rivulariaceae, in a marine subclade of the family containing Kyrtuthrix
   huatulcensis. In culture, the taxon exhibited tapering in isopolar
   filaments, providing further evidence that it was a member of the
   rivulariacean Glade. Based on molecular data for other cyanobacteria
   within the rivulariacean clade, we identified at least three more
   species morphologically distinguishable from the Binsilonema-like
   material, all of which show more pronounced tapering. These
   cyanobacteria include not only tropical marine strains, but also a
   strain isolated from the English coastline in the Atlantic Ocean. We
   propose a new genus and four species for members of this distinctive
   Glade, Nunduva fasciculata gen. nov., sp. nov., N. kania sp. nov., N.
   biania sp. nov., and N. britannica sp. nov. Other strains that others
   and we have isolated are sister to Nunduva and may eventually be placed
   within this genus, but at present, we consider the evidence for
   inclusion in Nunduva to be insufficient.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Occlusal pits and fissures of permanent molars are considered to have
   higher risk of developing caries. Enamel demineralization can be
   prevented by applying remineralizing agents, and their absorption
   increases with prior irradiation. This work evaluates the chemical
   changes produced by treating occlusal surfaces with sodium fluoride
   (NaF), hydroxyapatite-NaF-xylitol (HA-NaF-X), Er:YAG laser irradiation
   (L), and combinations thereof. Fifty enamel samples were randomly
   assigned to five groups (n = 10): NaF, HA-NaF-X, L, L + NaF, and L +
   HA-NaF-X. The chemical composition of human enamel was evaluated before
   (BT) and after (AT) treatment using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDS) and expressed in atomic percentages (at\%). For combined treatment
   groups, the products were applied after laser irradiation. The
   statistical analyses included a paired t-test and ANOVA (p <= 0 05).
   After treatment, a significant increase in F at\% was observed in the
   NaF group (2.71 +/- 1.41). The irradiated groups showed significant
   increases in Ca and P at\% and the Ca/P ratio. The highest values
   occurred for L + NaF (30.44 +/- 4.28 Ca at\%, 11.97 +/- 1.45 P at\%, and
   2.55 +/- 0.22 Ca/P ratio). Er:YAG laser irradiation alone or in combined
   protocols increased the Ca and P content of dental enamel, in vitro.},

Title = {Optical absorption, luminescence, and energy transfer processes studies
   for Dy3+/Tb3+-codoped borate glasses for
   solid-state lighting applications},

Abstract = {By using melt quenching technique, good optical quality singly doped
   Dy3+ or Tb3+ and Dy3+/Tb3+-codoped borate glasses were synthesized and
   studied by optical absorption, excitation, emission and decay lifetimes
   curve analysis. Following the absorption spectrum, the evaluated
   Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters (Omega(lambda) (lambda = 2, 4 and
   6)) were used to calculate the transition probability (A(R)), the
   branching ratio (beta(R)), and the radiative lifetime (tau(R)) for
   different luminescent transitions such as I-4(15/2) -> H-6(15/2),
   F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(11/2) and
   F-4(9/2) -> H-6(9/2), F-6(11/2) for the 0.5 mol \% singly Dy3+-doped
   glass. The beta(R) calculated (65\%) indicates that for lasing
   applications, F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) emission transition is highly
   suitable. For all the Dy3+/Tb3+-codoped glasses, Tb3+: D-5(3) -> F-7(6)
   emission decay lifetime curves are found to be non-exponential in nature
   for different concentrations of Dy3+ codoping. Using the
   Inokuti-Hirayama model, these nonexponential decay curves were analyzed
   to identify the nature of the energy transfer (ET) processes and here
   the electric dipole-dipole interaction is dominant for the ET. Based on
   the excitation and emission spectra and decay lifetimes curve analysis,
   the cross relaxation and ET processes between Dy3+ and Tb3+ were
   confirmed. For the 0.5 mol \% Tb3+ and 2.0 mol \% Dy3+-codoped glass,
   the evaluated Tb3+ -> Dy3+ ET efficiency (eta) is found to be 45\% under
   369 nm excitation. Further, for Tb3+/Dy3+-codoped glasses, an
   enhancement of Tb3+ green emission is observed up to 1.5 mol \% Dy3+
   codoping, and this is due to the non-radiative resonant ET from Dy3+ to
   Tb3+ upon 395 nm excitation. For singly 0.5 mol \% Dy3+ or 0.5 mol \%
   Tb3+-doped glass, the calculated color coordinates (x,y) and correlated
   color temperatures (CCT) represent the neutral white or warm white light
   regions, whereas Dy3+/Tb3+-codoped glasses (x,y) and CCT values fall in
   the yellowish green region with respect to the different Dy3+
   concentrations under 350 and 395 nm excitations. Following the analyzed
   optical data, the singly Dy3+ or Tb3+-doped and Dy3+/Tb3+-codoped
   glasses could be suggested as promising materials for their applications
   in solid state light emitting diodes and luminescent display devices.

Title = {Tracing the Repertoire of Promiscuous Enzymes along the Metabolic
   Pathways in Archaeal Organisms},
Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The metabolic pathways that carry out the biochemical transformations
   sustaining life depend on the efficiency of their associated enzymes. In
   recent years, it has become clear that promiscuous enzymes have played
   an important role in the function and evolution of metabolism. In this
   work we analyze the repertoire of promiscuous enzymes in 89
   non-redundant genomes of the Archaea cellular domain. Promiscuous
   enzymes are defined as those proteins with two or more different Enzyme
   Commission (E.C.) numbers, according the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes (KEGG) database. From this analysis, it was found that the
   fraction of promiscuous enzymes is lower in Archaea than in Bacteria. A
   greater diversity of superfamily domains is associated with promiscuous
   enzymes compared to specialized enzymes, both in Archaea and Bacteria,
   and there is an enrichment of substrate promiscuity rather than
   catalytic promiscuity in the archaeal enzymes. Finally, the presence of
   promiscuous enzymes in the metabolic pathways was found to be
   heterogeneously distributed at the domain level and in the phyla that
   make up the Archaea. These analyses increase our understanding of
   promiscuous enzymes and provide additional clues to the evolution of
   metabolism in Archaea.},

   and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Attenuated Total
   reflectance-Fourier transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman
   spectroscopy, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC). Also, the radiation shielding parameters
   such as mass attenuation coefficient (mu/rho), half value layer (HVL),
   mean free path (MFP) and exposure buildup factor (EBF) values were
   explored within the energy range 0.015 MeV-15 MeV using both XCOM and
   MCNPX code to determine the penetration of gamma and neutron radiations
   in the prepared glasses. The main BO3, BO4, BiO6, and ZnO4 structural
   units and Al-O-Al bonds were confirmed by ATR-FTIR and Raman
   spectroscopy. Weight loss, and the glass transition (T-g), onset
   crystallization (T-x), and crystallization (T-c) temperatures were
   determined from TGA and DSC measurements, respectively. The stability of
   the glass against crystallization (Delta T) is varied within the
   temperature range 114-135 degrees C for the studied glasses. In
   addition, the shielding parameters like the (mu/rho) values investigated
   using both MCNPX Monte Carlo and XCOM software are in good agreement
   with each other. The (mu/rho) values calculated using XCOM software were
   used to evaluate the HVL and MFP in the photon energy range 0.015 MeV-15
   MeV. It is found that all the synthesized glasses possess better
   shielding properties than ordinary concrete, zinc oxide soda lime silica
   glass and lead zinc phosphate glass indicating the high potentiality of
   the prepared glasses to be utilized as radiation shielding materials.},

Title = {Structural and optical studies of Er3+-doped alkali/alkaline

Abstract = {In the present work, we report on the optical spectral properties of
   Er3+-doped zinc boro-aluminosilicate glasses with an addition of 10 mol
   \% alkali/alkaline modifier regarding the fabrication of new optical
   materials for optical amplifiers. A total of 10 glasses were prepared
   using melt-quenching technique with the compositions (40-x)B2O3 -
   10SiO(2) -10Al(2)O(3)- 30ZnO- 10Li(2)O- xEr(2)O(3) and (40-x)B2O3-
   10SiO(2)-10Al(2)O(3) - 30ZnO- 10MgO- xEr(2)O(3) (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,1.0,
   and 2.0 mol \%). We confirm the amorphous-like structure for all the
   prepared glasses using X-ray diffraction (XRD). To study the functional
   groups of the glass composition after the melt-quenching process, Raman
   spectroscopy was used, and various structural units such as triangular
   and tetrahedral-borates (BO3 and BO4) have been identified. All the
   samples were characterized using optical absorption for UV, visible and
   NIR regions. Judd-Ofelt (JO) intensity parameters (Omega(lambda), lambda
   = 2,4 and 6) were calculated from the optical absorption spectra of two
   glasses LiEr 2.0 and MgEr 2.0 (doped with 2 mol \% of Er3+). JO
   parameters for LiEr 2.0 and MgEr 2.0 glasses follow the trend as
   Omega(6)>Omega(2)>Omega(4). UsingJudd-Ofelt intensity parameters, we
   obtained radiative probability A (S-1), branching ratios (beta),
   radiative decay lifetimes tau(rad) (mu s) of emissions from excited Er+3
   ions in LiEr 2.0 and MgEr 2.0 to all lower levels. Quantum efficiency
   (eta) of I-4(13/2) and S-4(3/2) levels for LiEr 2.0 and MgEr 2.0 with
   and without D-4(7/2) level was calculated using the radiative decay
   lifetimes tau(rad). (mu s) and measured lifetimes tau(exp), (mu s). We
   measured the visible photoluminescence under 377 nm excitation for both
   LiEr and MgEr glass series within the region 390-580 nm. Three bands
   were observed in the visible region at 407 nm, 530 nm, and 554 nm, as a
   result of H-2(9/2) -> I-4(15/2), H-2(11/2) -> I-4(5/2) and S-4(3/2) ->
   I-4(5/2) transitions, respectively. Decay lifetimes for emissions at 407
   nm, 530 nm, and 554 nm were measured and they show single exponential
   behavior for all the LiEr and MgEr glass series. From the
   photoluminescence and radiative decay lifetimes (tau(rad)), we
   calculated the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), emission cross-section
   (4) and bandwidth gain (FWHM x 4) parameters. Near-infrared
   photoluminescence under 980 nm excitation was measured for all the LiEr
   and MgEr glass series in the region 1420-1620 nm. NIR emissions show a
   broadband centered at-1530 nm due to the transition of Er3+: I-4(13/2)
   -> I-4(15/2). Decay lifetimes for NIR emission at-1530 nm were measured
   and they show a quite exponential nature for all the LiEr and MgEr glass
   series. From the NIR emission spectra and decay lifetimes, we calculated
   the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), the emission cross-section (4)
   and the bandwidth gain (FWHM x 4) for the NIR emission and it shows FWHM
   of 50-70 nm for prepared glasses, emission cross-section of (similar to
   3.

Title = {Structural, thermal and optical investigations of Dy3+-doped

Abstract = {Optically transparent Dy3+-doped borate glasses with the chemical
   composition (60-x) B2O3-10 WO3-10 ZnO-10 Li2O-10 Na2O-x Dy2O3 (x=0.1,
   0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mol \%) have been synthesized by melt
   quenching technique and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis
   (SEM-EDX), Attenuated Total reflectance-Fourier transform Infrared
   (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Thermo-gravimetric analysis
   (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical absorption and
   luminescence techniques. The amorphous nature of the prepared glasses
   has been confirmed through XRD and SEM measurements, and the EDX spectra
   show all the elements present in the respective glasses. The vibrational
   features of various functional groups like stretching vibrations of B-O
   linkages in BO4 tetrahedra, asymmetric stretching vibrations of B-O bond
   in trigonal BO3 units, stretching vibrations of W-O-W in WO4 or WO6
   units, vibrations of Zn-O bonds from ZnO4 groups, bending modes of ZnO4
   units, and vibrational modes of BO3 and BO4 due to alkali borates were
   identified by ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. For the prepared glasses;
   weight loss, and the glass transition (T-g), onset crystallization
   (T-x), crystallization (T-c) and melting (T-m) temperatures were
   determined from TGA and DSC measurements, respectively. Following the
   obtained T-g, T-x, T-c, and T-m values, the thermal stability (Delta T)
   and Hruby's values (H-R) were determined, the calculated Delta T values
   increased in the temperature range 131-143 degrees C and H-R values
   varied in the range 0.766-1.014 with Dy3+ concentration increment from
   0.1 to 1.5 mol \%, and the increasing stability of the glasses shows
   that they are thermally resistant. The optical properties of the titled
   glasses have been explored from the absorption, photoluminescence
   excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. For the 0.5 mol \%
   Dy3+-doped glass, to obtain the information concerning the nature of the
   ligand field environment around the Dy3+ ions, the Judd-Ofelt (JO)
   intensity parameters ohm(lambda) (lambda=2, 4 and 6) were evaluated from
   the measured oscillator strengths (f) of various absorption bands.
   Further, the radiative parameters such as radiative transition
   probabilities (A(R)), branching ratios (beta(R)), and the radiative
   lifetimes (tau(R)) of F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2),
   F-4(9/2) -> H-6(11/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(9/2) main emission transitions
   were calculated by using JO parameters. The photoluminescence properties
   were examined under ultraviolet (UV)/near UV (NUV) and blue excitations.
   Luminescence spectra measured for different concentrations of Dy3+-doped
   glasses by exciting the glasses at 350, 364, 386, 400, 425 and 452 nm
   wavelengths show concentration quenching beyond 0.5 mol\% and the
   luminescence quenching has been explained by using cross-relaxation (CR)
   channels and resonant energy transfer (RET). For the 0.
   5 mol\% Dy3+-doped glass, the measured decay lifetime and the evaluated
   quantum efficiency values are similar to 211.8 mu s and 68.1\%,
   respectively. Following the luminescence spectra, the yellow-to-blue
   (Y/B) luminescence intensity ratios, color chromaticity coordinates (x,
   y) and correlated color temperatures (CCT) of the glasses have also been
   estimated to evaluate the white light generation with respect to Dy3+
   ion concentration. The color coordinates and CCT values for 0.5 mol\%
   Dy3+-doped glass (optimum concentration) represent the warm white light
   region for all the selected UV and blue excitation wavelengths. The
   obtained results indicate that the optimized 0.5 mol\% Dy3+-doped glass
   may be useful for the warm white light emitting applications as well as
   for solid state yellow laser emission and luminescent display devices.

Abstract = {Zinc molybdenum borotellurite glasses containing different network
   modifiers with the nominal composition of 60 TeO2-10 B2O3-10 MoO3-10
   ZnO-10 MO (MO = Li2O, Na2O, K2O, MgO, CaO, and PbO) were prepared by
   melt quenching method. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   studies allow to monitor the structural modifications leading to the
   formation of bridging oxygens (Te-O-Te, B-O-B, Mo-O-Mo, and Te-O-Mo
   bonds) and nonbridging oxygens (Te = O, Te-O-M+, Mo-O- bonds in the MoO6
   octahedral units, Zn-O bonds from ZnO4) with the addition of alkali (Li,
   Na, and K), alkaline (Mg, Ca), or heavy metal (Pb) oxides. The Te 3d
   localized core-levels spectra show an asymmetry due to the existence of
   different Te-based structural clusters and were fitted with three
   contributions such as Te ions in TeO4 trigonal bipyramid configuration,
   Te ions in TeO3 (-) trigonal pyramid configuration and TeO3+1 polyhedra,
   respectively. The analysis of the Mo 3d spectra indicates prevailingly
   Mo6+ ions only. The Zn 2p core-level XPS spectra demonstrate that the
   zinc is mainly coordinated by four oxygen atoms. The essential radiation
   shielding parameters were studied for the prepared glasses in the photon
   energy range 1 keV to 100 GeV using WinXCom software program. Parameters
   like mass attenuation coefficient (mu/rho), effective atomic number (Z
   (eff)), and mean free path (MFP) are evaluated. Further, by using
   geometric progression method, exposure buildup factor (EBF) values were
   also calculated in the incident photon energy range 0.015-15 MeV, up to
   penetration depth of 40 mfp (mean free path). The macroscopic effective
   removal cross sections (a(R)) for fast neutrons have been calculated.
   The maximum values of mu/rho and Z (eff) were found for PbO-introduced
   glass though it possesses a lower value for MFP and EBF. The obtained
   results indicate that PbO-based glass is the best radiation shielding
   material among the studied glasses.},

Title = {Daytime restricted feeding modifies the daily regulation of fatty acid

Abstract = {Daytime restricted feeding (2 h of food access from 12.00 to 14.00 hours
   for 3 weeks) is an experimental protocol that modifies the relationship
   between metabolic networks and the circadian molecular clock. The
   precise anatomical locus that controls the biochemical and physiological
   adaptations to optimise nutrient use is unknown. We explored the changes
   in liver oxidative lipid handling, such as beta-oxidation and its
   regulation, as well as adaptations in the lipoprotein profile. It was
   found that daytime restricted feeding promoted an elevation of
   circulating ketone bodies before mealtime, an altered hepatic daily
   rhythmicity of (CO2)-C-14 production from radioactive palmitic acid, and
   an up-regulation of the fatty acid oxidation activators, the
   alpha-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the deacetylase
   silent mating type information regulation homolog 1, and the
   transcriptional factor PPAR gamma-1 alpha coactivator. An increased
   localisation of phosphorylated alpha-subunit of AMPK in the periportal
   hepatocytes was also observed. Liver hepatic lipase C, important for
   lipoprotein transformation, showed a change of daily phase with a peak
   at the time of food access. In serum, there was an increase of LDL,
   which was responsible for a net elevation of circulating cholesterol. We
   conclude that our results indicate an enhanced fasting response in the
   liver during daily synchronisation to food access, which involves
   altered metabolic and cellular control of fatty acid oxidation as well a
   significant elevation of serum LDL. These adaptations could be part of
   the metabolic input that underlies the expression of the food-entrained
   oscillator.},

   MoO4- tetrahedral units including stretching vibrations of ZnOT
   structural units, and non-hygroscopic nature of the glasses are
   confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared
   (ATR-FTIR) and Raman spectra, respectively. The thermal properties of
   the glasses were studied by simultaneous thermal analysis (STA)
   technique and from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles
   the glass transition temperature (Tg), onset crystallization temperature
   (T-x), and crystallization temperature (Ta) are identified and from
   these values, the calculated thermal stability values are varied in the
   temperature range 88-103 C with different rare earth ions incorporation.
   From the measured optical absorption spectrum of the host glass, direct
   and indirect optical band gap energies were evaluated and the values of
   indirect optical band gap energies calculated from the absorption
   spectrum (E-opt) matches well with the values of optical band gap
   energies (Eg,) calculated from absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) method,
   and the glass has Urbach energy value 0.627 eV. The fundamental
   absorption edge wavelength (lambda(edge)) shows red-shift with RE ions
   doping into the host glass due to the formation of non-bridging oxygens.

Abstract = {Six optically transparent zinc molybdenum borotellurite glasses
   containing different network modifier ions (alkali, alkaline, and heavy
   metal oxides) with compositions, 60TeO(2)-10B(2)O(3)-10MoO(3)-10ZnO -10M
   (mol\%) (M = Li2O, Na2O, K2O, MgO, CaO, and PbO) were prepared by melt
   quenching technique. For all these glass matrices, physical, structural,
   thermal, and optical properties have been studied. The physical
   properties of all the glasses were evaluated with respect to the glass
   composition. The structure of the glasses was monitored by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy
   dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier
   transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD and SEM
   measurements reveal the amorphous nature for all the prepared glasses
   and EDAX confirms that all the elements present in the respective
   glasses. The presence of various functional groups such as stretching
   vibrations of the TeO4 trigonal bi-pyramid structure, asymmetrical
   stretching vibrations of the TeO3 trigonal structural units, B-O bond
   stretching in BO4 groups, asymmetric stretching vibrations of B-O bond
   in trigonal BO3 units from various types of borate groups, stretching
   vibrations of Mo-O-Mo linkages, corner shared MoO6 octahedra units,
   stretching vibrations of Mo-O- bonds in MoO6 units, including stretching
   vibrations of ZnO4- structural units, and non-hygroscopic nature of the
   glasses are confirmed by ATR-FTIR and Raman spectra, respectively. It is
   established that the glass network is primarily a mixture of TeO4,
   TeO3/TeO3+1 and BO4, BO3 structural units. The thermal properties, of
   the glasses were obtained by performing simultaneous thermal analysis
   (STA). For these glasses, from the differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) profiles the glass transition temperature (T-g), onset
   crystallization temperature (T-X), crystallization temperature (T-C),
   and melting temperature (T-m) are identified and from these values, all
   relevant thermal parameters were evaluated to obtain complete thermal
   behavior of the synthesized glasses. The calculated thermal stability
   values have been varied in the temperature range of 106-189 degrees C
   with different modifier ions incorporation. For alkali metal oxides
   incorporated glasses reduced glass transition temperature (T-rg) values
   almost coincide with classical two-third rule while alkaline and heavy
   metal oxides based glasses weakly obey this rule in our study of
   relationship between glass transition temperature (T-g) and melting
   temperature (T-m). From the measured optical absorption spectra of all
   the glasses, direct and indirect optical band gap energies were
   evaluated and the value's of indirect optical band gap energies
   calculated from absorption spectra (E-opt) match well with the values of
   optical band gap energies (E-opt(asf)) calculated from absorption
   spectrum fitting (ASF) method. The optical absorption cut-off
   wavelengths have shown a gradual spectral red shift from Li to Pb oxides
   based glass compositions indicating the decrease of rigidity of the
   glasses. Optical band gap energies were calculated to be within the
   range of 2.325-2.655 eV for direct and 1.790-2.
   378 eV for indirect transitions and both direct and indirect band gap
   values decreases monotonically from Li to Pb oxides introduced glass,
   The structural, thermal, and optical features of all the synthesized
   tellurite rich glasses with different modifier ions are understood and
   our comprehensive analysis could contribute towards the development of
   suitable fiber Raman amplifiers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Tuning the structural, thermal, and optical properties of low phonon
   energy glasses such as tellurite glasses (phonon energy similar to 750
   cm(-1)) with suitable rare earth dopants is a key issue in the
   fabrication of solid state lasers and optical amplifiers. In this work,
   (70-x) TeO2-10 WO3-10 ZnO-5 TiO2-5 Na2O-(x) Pr2O3 (x = 1.0-5.0 mol \%)
   glasses were synthesized with high optical quality and characterized
   using Xray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy and Energy
   dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDAX), Attenuated total
   reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), Raman spectroscopy,
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC), optical absorption and luminescence techniques. The XRD and SEM
   measurements reveal the amorphous nature of all the prepared glasses and
   EDAX confirms all the elements present in the respective glasses. The
   presence of various functional groups such as stretching vibrations of
   Te-O bonds in the {[}TeO4] trigonal bi-pyramid units, symmetrical
   stretching or bending vibrations of Te-O-Te or O-Te-O linkages at corner
   sharing sites along the chains of TeO4, TeO3 and TeO3+1, stretching
   vibrations of W-O- and W=O bonds in WO4 tetragonal or WO6 octagonal
   units, vibrations of Zn-O bonds from ZnO4 groups, including
   nonhygroscopic nature of the glasses are confirmed by ATR-FTIR and Raman
   spectra, respectively. For Pr3+-doped glasses, from the DSC profiles the
   glass transition temperature (T-g), onset crystallization temperature
   (T-x), crystallization temperature (T-c), and melting temperature (T-m)
   are identified and the evaluated thermal stability values varied in the
   temperature range of 169-220 degrees C with increasing Pr3+ doping
   concentration. Further, the Pr3+-doped tellurite glasses demonstrate
   excellent glass stability with higher criterion of Hruby's value (H-R)
   between 1.9 and 3.9. From the measured optical absorption spectrum,
   experimental oscillator strengths are calculated and used to evaluate
   three phenomenological Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters
   Omega(lambda)(lambda = 2, 4 and 6) and respective radiative properties
   such as radiative transition probabilities (A(R)), the branching ratios
   (beta(R)), and the radiative lifetime (tau(R)) of metastable states for
   1.0 mol \% Pr3+-doped glass. Five main emission transitions at P-3(0) ->
   H-3(5) (530 nm; green) with a shoulder at 543 nm, a weak band at D-1(2)
   -> H-3(4) (592 nm; orange), P-3(0) -> H-3(6) (615 nm; orange), P-3(0) ->
   F-3(2) (649 nm; red), and P-3(0) -> F-3(3) (686 nm; red) upon exciting
   at 486 nm (H-3(4) -> P-3(0)) wavelength are observed from the
   luminescence spectra of Pr3+-doped tellurite glasses. Following the
   energy level diagram, Pr3+ ion concentration quenching on the
   luminescence intensity has been explained by a nonradiative energy
   transfer between the ions through cross-relaxation and energy migration
   processes.
   The concentration dependent structural, thermal, and optical behaviors
   of Pr3+-doped tellurite glasses are understood and our systematic
   analysis could contribute towards the development of suitable optical
   devices fabrication. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Histochemical detection of acetogenins and storage molecules in the

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {Acetogenins (ACGs) are bioactive corn pounds with cytotoxic properties
   in different cell lines. They are antitumoural, antiparasitic,
   antimalarial, insecticidal, antimicrobial, anti fungal and
   antibacterial. These secondary metabolites function in plant defence and
   are found in specific organelles and specific cells, thereby preventing
   toxicity to the plant itself and permitting site-specific defence. The
   aim of this work was to histochemically determine the to situ
   localisation of ACGs in the endosperm of Annona macroprophyllata seeds
   using Kedde's reagent Additionally, the co-localisation of ACGs with
   other storage molecules was analysed. The seeds were analysed after 6
   and 10 days of imbibition. when 1 or 2 cm of the radicle had emerged and
   metabolism was fully established. The seeds were then transversally cut
   in half at the midline and processed using different histological and
   histochemical techniques. Positive reactions with Kedde's reagent were
   only observed in fresh, unfixed sections that were preserved in water,
   and staining was found only in the large cells (the idioblasts) at the
   periphery of the endosperm. The ACGs `positive reaction with Sudan Ill
   corroborated their lipid nature. Paraffin sections stained with Naphthol
   Blue Black showed reactions in the endosperm parenchyma cells and
   stained the proteoplasts blue indicating that they might correspond to
   storage sites for albumin like proteins. Lugol's iodine, which is
   similar in chemical composition to Wagner's reagent, caused a golden
   brown reaction product in the cytoplasm of the idioblasts, which may
   indicate the presence of alkaloids. Based on these results, we propose
   that Kedde's reagent is an appropriate histochemical stain for detecting
   ACGs in situ in idioblasts and that idioblasts store ACGs and probably
   alkaloids. ACGs that are located in idioblasts found in restricted,
   peripheral areas of the endosperm could serve as a barrier that protects
   the seeds against insects and pathogen attack.},

Abstract = {We studied the mesofaunal arthropod diversity in a shrub mangrove in the
   Punta Sur area within the National Park Reefs of Cozumel Island in the
   South of Mexico. Two mangrove areas were selected for sampling,
   dominated by Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia nitida, respectively. Four
   sampling periods, two during the dry season and two during the rainy
   season, and 25 random litter samples of litter (225 cm(2)) per site and
   date led to a total of 200 samples. Spatial and temporal variation of
   arthropod diversity was analyzed at the order/suborder level. A total of
   90,680 arthropods belonging to 30 taxa were recorded during the study,
   Oribatida being most abundant with 61.8\%, followed by springtails
   (14\%). Densities of arthropods were higher in the rainy season than in
   the dry season, showing a strong positive correlation with humidity.
   Highest abundance was found in the R. mangle mangrove in the rainy
   season, and highest diversity was found in the A. nitida mangrove in the
   dry season. Seasonal distribution of litter fauna in two mangroves are
   related with the particular characteristics shown in each one. (C) 2014

Abstract = {In Biological research is still necessary for the demonstration of the
   peripheral innervation in numerous tissues and organs. The aim of this
   study was to rescue and modernize one of the most consistent methods
   that we have tried to demonstrate peripheral innervation. Llombart's
   technique for nerve fibers was adapted by paraffin cuts of 7 mu m in
   different animal tissue. The silver impregnation was done by dripping in
   a moist chamber. It was demonstrated in a constant, precise and serial
   form, nerve terminations, and sensorial corpuscles, neurons, and
   peripheral nerve fibers. Despite being highly specific to nerve fibers,
   the technique does not sacrifice tissue panorama so it gives beautiful
   images set. Without being a technique to argentaffin structures, it
   clearly shows two types of argentaffin cells in the adrenal glands. The
   addition of the metal reactive in droplets and in a humid chamber
   provides a very economical variant.},

Abstract = {The effect of the support tree species and the seasonal and altitudinal
   variations on the physical-chemical characteristics of the water and
   soil accumulated in plants of the epiphytic bromeliad Tillandsia
   violacea were studied in ``El Chico{''} National Park, a temperate
   forest from Hidalgo, in Central Mexico. The relationship of these
   factors with arthropods living in theme was also studied. It was found
   that the tree support species influenced the ions concentration in water
   and soil. The highest values of ions were found in plants from Abies
   religiosa. Altitude and the season of sampling affected calcium
   concentrations, as well as pH of soil and water accumulated on epiphytic
   Tillandsia. Electrical conductivity, calcium and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) in epiphytic water accounted for more than 60\% of the
   variation in the density of arthropods. In the accumulated soil pH
   (among 3.4-8.3), organic carbon content (17.16-30.07 mg g(-1)), sodium
   and potassium concentrations (0.26-1.43, 0.49-34.87 cmol (+) kg(-1),
   respectively) were the most important factors correlated with the total
   fauna abundance. These results showed the role of epiphytic plants as
   refuges and nutrient source for arthropod communities and their

Title = {Anti-inflammatory activity of Ziziphus amole},
Journal = {PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {75-80},
Abstract = {The search for new anti-inflammatory drugs with fewer side effects than
   those currently available in the market has recently attracted the
   interest of scientists. Medicinal plants might be a natural source of
   medicines. Such is the case with Ziziphus amole (Sesse \& Moc.) M.C.
   Johnst. or corongoro, a plant species native to Mexico. It is used in
   traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory drug, a healing substance
   and an analgesic, and in the treatment of diarrhea, diabetes, asthma and
   hemorrhoids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
   effect of Z. amole in the acute 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
   (TPA) induced mouse ear edema model, as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO)
   activity in hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of leaves,
   stems, bark and roots. Secondary metabolites were identified. We
   measured the anti-inflammatory activity of TPA in the biological model
   of induced ear edema in mice, and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of
   each extract. The extracts with the highest yields were those of leaf
   (LEM) with 9.3\%, and bark (BEM) with 8.9\% both in methanol. The
   extracts of Z. amole revealed the presence of terpenes, glycosides,
   flavonoids and saponins. The methanol root extract significantly
   inhibited (REM) (p <= 0.05) ear edema in mice by 82.3\%; this extract
   was more active than the reference drug indomethacin (80.9\% inhibition
   of the edema). The myeloperoxidase enzyme activity was significantly
   inhibited by the methanol bark extract (BEM) by 91.1\%, followed by the
   root extract in ethyl acetate (REA) with 90.5\% inhibition. Results
   obtained in this study validate the use of Z. amole as a medicinal plant
   for the treatment of inflammation and related disorders.},

Abstract = {This work addresses the most relevant advances in the breeding and
   rearing of marine ornamental species. The main breakthroughs in marine
   ornamental fish culture are discussed, with seahorses deserving a
   section of their own as a result of their conservation status and unique
   biology. Details on spawning, embryo development, larval rearing,
   plankton culturing, and tank design are presented. In addition, with the
   increase in popularity of ornamental invertebrates in reef aquariums,
   details on the culturing techniques of some of the most traded
   invertebrate groups (e.g., live rocks, corals, anemones, polychaetes,
   mollusks, decapod crustaceans and echinoderms) are also discussed.
   Finally, the last part of this work highlights the concerns toward the
   establishment of sustainable collection, production, and trading
   practices for marine ornamentals as well as the urgent need to develop
   reliable traceability protocols to distinguish sustainably caught and/or
   cultured specimens from wild ones. This work represents not only an
   exhaustive and updated bibliographical source but also a starting point
   for all those who want to contribute to the development of this

Abstract = {Debaryomyces hansenii is a spoilage yeast able to grow in a variety of
   ecological niches, from seawater to dairy products. Results presented in
   this article show that (i) D. hansenii has an inherent resistance to
   H2O2 which could be attributed to the fact that this yeast has a basal
   catalase activity which is several-fold higher than that observed in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the same culture conditions, (ii) D.
   hansenii has two genes (DhCTA1 and DhCTT1) encoding two catalase
   isozymes with a differential enzymatic activity profile which is not
   strictly correlated with a differential expression profile of the
   encoding genes.},

Title = {Effects of two dietary protein levels on energy balance and digestive
   capacity of Octopus maya},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {165-180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Octopus maya is a carnivorous species and protein is the main energy
   source. During the present study, two different dietary protein levels
   (40 and 60\% CP) were offered to octopuses as specifically designed
   artificial diets, to determine protein needs and the effects on
   metabolism. Frozen crab (Callinectes spp.) was used as control. Results
   obtained demonstrated that crab remains as one of the best diets for O.
   maya. The artificial diet with 60\% CP produced a low but positive
   growth rate, and at times, a physiological response similar to that
   observed in octopuses fed crabs. The present results show the capacity
   of O. maya juveniles to adjust their digestive enzymes to different
   types of food and protein level, and this appears to be well correlated
   with octopus growth. General proteases and trypsin from the pancreas
   were well correlated with growth rates. A low activity was observed in
   octopuses fed 40\% PC diet (negative growth rate), while a high activity
   was present in octopuses fed 60\% CP diet and crabs (low and high growth
   rate, respectively). In contrast, these same enzymes were inducted in
   the salivary glands of octopuses fed with the diet that promoted weight
   loss (40\% CP diet), while a reduced activity was observed in octopuses
   fed crabs. Energy budget indicates that the animals ingested more than
   1,000 kJ week(-1) kg(-1); with such energy, octopuses should satisfy
   their physiological demands such as was observed when animals were fed
   crab (I = 1,300 kJ week(-1) kg(-1); P = 834 kJ week(-1) kg(-1)).
   However, a very low digested energy was observed in octopuses the fed
   artificial diets, indicating that these could have a factor that limits
   digestibility.},

Title = {Brief Description of the Histological, Cytological and Functional
   Aspects of the Ovary},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {3-24},
Abstract = {The ovary is formed by three main compartments: superficial epithelium,
   cortex and medulla. The superficial epithelium is constituted by one
   layer of cubic cells. The cortex is a wide peripheral zone containing
   the follicles, the functional and structural unit of the ovary, and a
   stroma formed by compact connective tissue. Every follicle is formed by
   one oocyte surrounded by follicular cells, also called granulosa cells,
   and a basal lamina surrounding them. The medulla is the central region
   of the ovary formed by connective tissue with numerous blood vessels. As
   the follicles develop they change their size, morphology and physiology.
   Primordial follicles are formed by the oocyte surrounded by flat
   follicular cells. Primary follicles are characterized by the initiation
   of follicular growth. Secondary follicles are characterized by two or
   more layers of granulosa cells and no antrum. The early antral follicles
   are characterized by the formation and progressive growth of a cavity,
   due to the accumulation of a fluid. Once the antrum is formed the
   follicle goes through several stages: (a) basal growth, (b) selection
   and (c) dominance. The process of follicular growth is controlled by
   extra-ovarian and intra-ovarian factors and the importance of each of
   these factors depends on the stage of follicle development.
   Extra-ovarian factors regulate growth of antral and preovulatory
   follicles, while intra-ovarian factors regulate growth of preantral and
   early antral follicles. The ovary is not only involved in sexual
   reproduction, but also has great influence on the entire hormonal
   functioning during development of the organism. The ovary is the site of
   the highest synthesis and secretion of progesterone and estrogen in
   mammals and gives rise to cyclical fluctuations in the levels of these
   hormones in the blood. Before ovulation, granulosa cells mature to form
   the corpus luteum, which is responsible for the secretion of
   progesterone and estrogen.},

Title = {Apoptosis},

Year = {2011},
Pages = {63-80},
Abstract = {Cell death is a fundamental physiological process involved in
   controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation during
   embryonic development, and in the renewal of cellular tissue throughout
   adulthood. It is presently known that some alterations in this process
   modify the cellular behavior and can lead to different pathologies, such
   as certain cancers and neurodegeneration processes. Apoptosis is the
   best studied cell death, and it is considered as programmed type I cell
   death. This process is characterized by several morphological cellular
   changes where cellular shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclear
   fragmentation are included. The apoptosis is executed by a group of
   proteases, denominated caspases, which lead to the cellular
   characteristics of the process.},

Title = {Autophagy},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {81-102},
Abstract = {Autophagy is a physiological process conserved by evolution for the
   recycling of cell constituents, as organelles or fragments of cytoplasm.
   Autophagy does not cause loss of cell chemical components as the cell
   reutilizes them. The lysosomes are acidic vesicles delimited by a single
   membrane formed in the Golgi apparatus. They contain acid hydrolases for
   degradation of proteins; lipids, nucleic acids and glucids, and they
   fuse with diverse types of phagocytic vesicles. Autophagosomes contain
   undegraded cytoplasmic ground substance and recognizable organelles. The
   transformation of an autophagosome in an autolysosome occurs by the
   acquisition of lysosomal membrane proteins and the delivery of acid
   hydrolases. The autophagy mechanism is considered as a protective
   system; organisms in starving conditions, autophagy is a procedure to
   reduce metabolic demand by the cell and thus avoid death. On the other
   hand, autophagic cell death is a form of programmed cell death
   morphological and metabolic different from apoptosis. Autophagic cell
   death is accompanied by cytoplasmic vacuolization and activation of
   lysosomal enzymes. Due to the absence of a rupture of cell membrane and
   leak of cytoplasmic content, this cell death program is characterized by
   the lack of a tissue inflammatory response.},

   The mitochondrial generation of ATP requires the presence of an

   cells. Oncotic cell death is characterized by early plasma membrane
   rupture and disruption of organelles including mitochondria. The plasma

Abstract = {Initially the ovarian cords are formed by pre-granulosa somatic cells
   and oogonia, which are become oocytes at the meiotic S phase.
   Pre-granulosa-oocyte interactions, through cell contacts and/or by means
   of paracrine factors, promote oocyte survival. During prefollicular
   phase the somatic cell death is infrequent, this has been shown in
   diverse studies involving different animal models. For instance, in
   sheep pre-granulosa cells present in ovigerous cords do not appear to be
   affected by apoptosis. However, recent studies demonstrated the
   expression of Bok, Bcl-X(L), TNF and full length and cleaved caspase-3
   in fetal ovaries, with specific patterns in oocytes and in pre-granulosa
   cells. However, recent studies demonstrated the expression of Bok,
   Bcl-X(L), TNF and full length and cleaved caspase-3 in fetal ovaries,
   with specific patterns in oocytes and in pre-granulosa cells. Bok
   markedly reduces vulnerability to apoptosis, conversely, loss of
   Bcl-X(L) increases apoptosis. These results suggest important roles for
   Bok and Bcl-X(L) in human ovarian development.},

Abstract = {Atresia occurs in neonate, as well as in prepubertal organisms, the
   follicles that reach the antral follicular phase will inevitably be
   eliminated as a consequence of diverse causes as the absence of the
   hormone source present once the organism reach puberty. Most follicles
   appear to undergo atresia at an earlier stage of growth. Basal
   concentration of gonadotropins appears sufficient to maintain follicle
   growth to small antral stage only. Prepubertal mice ovaries possess a
   mixture of late preantral and early antral follicles destined to atresia
   due to inadequate gonadotropin support prior to puberty. Therefore,
   before the Onset of puberty, the normal fate of growing follicles is
   atretic demise. Observations of the ovary atresia demonstrated that in
   neonate and prior to puberty most atresia occurs in preantral follicles.},

Abstract = {From semantic point of view, information is usually contained in small
   units, called facts that are usually smaller than sentences.
   Identification of these facts in a text is not a trivial task. We
   present a heuristic algorithm for extraction of facts from sentences
   using a simple representation based on a relational data model. We focus
   our study on texts that contain a lot of facts by their nature:
   structured textbooks. The algorithm is based on data obtained by a
   syntactic analyzer. The obtained facts can be useful for information
   retrieval tasks, automatic summarization, etc. Our experiments are
   conducted for Spanish language. We obtained better results than the
   similar methods.},

Title = {Embryonic Development of the Ovary, Sexual Reproduction and Meiosis},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {25-48},
Abstract = {Sex first evolved in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes some two
   billons years ago. Fertilization is the union of two haploid gametes of
   different sex; the resulting diploid cell is the zygote. In mammalian
   species gametes are derived from precursors termed primordial germ cells
   (PGCs). Specification of the germline occurs through: (1) repression of
   somatic differentiation; (2) reacquisition of potential pluripotency;
   (3) genome wide epigenetic reprogramming. In several mammals the
   maintenance of germ cell linage is not due to a preformed ``germ
   plasma{''}, but is induced by environmental signals. In mammals PGCs
   originate in extraembryonic region and eventually move to gonadal
   ridges, located in the medial part of the urogenital ridge. Observations
   and experimental evidence demonstrate that PGCs move actively from the
   hindgut to the gonadal ridges. However, some observations suggest that
   most displacements of these cells may be explained by global growth
   movements. In most mammals sex determination is genetically controlled
   by the presence or absence of Y chromosome and the expression of gene
   Sry. However, the ovary differentiation requires in addition the action
   of a precise gene cascade. The main process that marks PCGs/oogonia sex
   differentiation within fetal ovary is the beginning of meiosis. During
   the progression of the first meiotic prophase many germ cells are
   eliminated, around 70\% in mice, rats and humans. Prenatal development
   of the follicles is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones
   produced by the hypophysis (FSH, LH), and paracrine regulatory factors
   produced by the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells. Epigenetic
   signals are covalent modifications of histones or DNA that convey a
   specific ``meaning{''} to the stretch of chromatin on which they are
   found. Frequently they induce changes in chromatin conformation and gene
   expression. Pluripotent embryonic germ cells are capable of giving rise
   to all tissues, thus they must be able to reorganize their mechanisms of
   gene regulation to allow multiple lines of cell differentiation. Besides
   epigenetic modifications regulate X inactivation/reactivation in the
   female embryo and mark the paternal and maternal genome of germ cells,
   making the expression of a group of genes monoallelic, crucial for
   embryo development termed for modification such as ``imprinted{''}
   genes.},

Abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal system becomes activated in the human
   fetus. Negative feedback becomes operative towards term. During infancy
   gonadotropin concentration increases steroid secretion more in boys than
   in girls. The signification of this early hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal
   activation is not known. During infancy serum concentration of
   gonadotropins appear to be sufficient to maintain growing follicles to
   small antral stage. In the absence of appropriated levels of LH, FSH or
   both, these follicles are unable to enter the preovulatory stage. In
   infantile rodents there is an accelerated loss of follicles from the
   resting pool during the initial waves of follicle growth. The presence
   of atretic processes during childhood was described in human and rat
   ovaries. Puberty involves the reactivation of GnRH pulse generator by
   removal of central system restrain. A large number of oocytes of rats
   from newborn to puberty are eliminated by means of different cell death
   processes: apoptosis, autophagy and a mixed process in which both routes
   participate in the same cell.},

Title = {Necrosis},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {111-121},
Abstract = {The term necrosis was used for accidental, not programmed death of cells
   or tissues with uncontrolled release of cellular content resulting in
   inflammation. Necrosis is a term used by pathologists to designate the
   sum of changes that occurred in cell and tissues after they have died.
   Different experiments carried out in different cell types, species and
   cell death inducers show several traits that delineate a sequence of
   intracellular events specific to necrotic cell death. Morphological
   necrosis is characterized by cellular swelling including dilation of the
   endoplasmic reticulum, cellular lysis and subsequent inflammation. Core
   events of necrosis are bioenergetic failure and rapid loss of plasma
   membrane integrity. These failures results from defined molecular events
   including increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production,
   channel-mediated calcium uptake, activation of non-apoptotic proteases,
   swelling of mitochondria, perinuclear clustering of organelles and
   enzymatic destruction of cofactors required for ATP production, cell
   lysis and inflammation. The default occurrence of necrosis and its
   unmasking by inhibition of autophagy and/or apoptosis might reflect its
   early emergency in evolution.},

Title = {Prepubertal Oocytes},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {173-184},
Abstract = {Numerous studies of the processes of cell death in newborn to
   prepubertal mammals has been carried out mainly I rodents. In these
   animals this period was divided in three ranges of age: 1-10 days, 10-15
   days and 15-28 days. One day old rats two structural patterns of oocyte
   dying in the first meiotic prophase can be distinguished: one with
   nuclear elongated parallel structures corresponding two synaptonemal
   complexes of oocytes dying in pachytene stage and the second pattern
   corresponding to diakinesis, a pseudo interphase, the last stage of the
   first meiotic prophase. In ovaries of 10-15 days old rats a large
   proportion of pre-antral and small antral follicles undergo atresia.
   Most these oocytes located in these follicles are simultaneously
   positive to active caspase-3, TUNEL markers of apoptosis and also to
   lamp1 and acid phosphatase markers of autophagy. In ovaries of 15-28
   days old rats the simultaneous presence in the same oocyte of the four
   markers is frequent in atretic follicles. As in the previous groups, a
   small number of primary follicles are in process of atresia. The most
   frequent double association of markers is active caspase-3 (apoptotic
   marker) with lamp1 (autophagic marker). This association is five times
   more frequent than caspase-3 with TUNEL, both apoptotic markers. These
   data suggest that very early in the process of cell death, some features
   of apoptosis and autophagy are simultaneously present. The presence of
   one or several typical features of apoptosis as DNA fragmentation or
   caspase-3 are not per se a definitive sign that this cell is dying by an
   apoptotic pathway, at least until the presence of other processes of
   cell death as autophagy are determined in this cell. The same is valid
   for all processes of cell death.},

Title = {Follicular Atresia in Adult Animals},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {203-219},
Abstract = {Atresia is a hormonally controlled process in which the oocytes,
   granulosa cells and theca cells are involved in processes of cell death.
   Follicle development or atresia is regulated by the interplay of cell
   death and survival factors as gonadal steroids, cytokines and growth
   factors. Main families of molecules cell death or surviving are:
   caspases (cystein aspartate-specific proteases), all of them cleave
   substrates exclusively after asparagines residues. Kit gene encodes a
   receptor protein (KIT) a type III transmembrane tyrosine kinase
   receptor, which is involved in one of the ways of initiation of
   apoptotic process. Members of BCL-2 family are important regulators of
   apoptosis in the ovary. The ratio BCL-2 to BAX determines survival or
   death following an apoptotic stimulus. Members of TNF family have been
   implicated in follicular atresia in mammals. The oncosuppresive nuclear
   protein p53 is related to experimentally induced follicular atresia and
   granulosa cells apoptosis. Members of the insulin-like growth factor
   (IGF) system play a role in follicle development and a lower molecular
   weight member, IGFBP-5, is expressed during atresia. The main mechanism
   of follicular atresia is apoptosis, but also are present autophagy,
   necrosis, and a process with mixed features of apoptosis and autophagy
   in the same oocyte; all of them are programmed processes of cell death.},

Title = {Luteolysis},
Booktitle = {CELL DEATH IN MAMMALIAN OVARY},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {221-232},
Abstract = {In most mammals the corpus luteum (CL) remains functional for a period
   related to the length of the estral cycle. In the absence of the
   luteotrophic signal, the CL undergoes spontaneous loss of cell function
   (functional luteolysis) and structural regression (structural
   luteolysis), allowing the development of a new ovulatory cycle.
   Apoptosis occurs during spontaneous and experimental CL regression.
   Ovaries collected from caspase-3 deficient mice retained many corpora
   lutea at any point of time recorded post ovulation. In the marmoset, a
   primate, the CL showed numerous features of autophagic cell death as
   vacuolated cytoplasm, vacuoles containing cytoplasmic debris, and
   autophagosomes. On the other hand, typical morphological features were
   absent. These observations suggest that luteolytic cell death might be a
   combination of apoptosis and autophagy. The vasculature is an important
   regulator of CL functions. The capillaries disappear earlier than the
   large vessels during structural luteolysis. The endocrine mechanisms of
   the cyclical regression of the CL are slightly different in primates and
   other mammals. Physiological levels progesterone produced in the corpus
   luteum protect cells against death. The decline in progesterone
   preceding structural luteolysis is a prerequisite for initiation of
   apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) involved in
   apoptotic cell death activation, affecting primarily endothelial cells.

Abstract = {The effects of different dietary lipids (hydrogenated coconut oil, corn
   oil, linseed oil, and mixtures of corn oil, linseed oil, menhaden oil,
   and/or soy lecithin) on the fatty acid composition of the sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis were investigated. Dietary lipid
   compositions were reflected in the fatty acid profiles of sea urchin
   guts, gonads and shells. The shells had the highest level of 20:4n-6 and
   20:5n-3, while the highest levels of monounsaturated fatty acids were
   seen in the guts. Tissue levels of 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3 were influenced
   by the dietary levels of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. The addition of soy
   lecithin to the diet (CLnML) enhanced the production and incorporation
   of 20:4n-6 in shell and gonad. Sea urchin also synthesized and
   incorporated 20 and 22 carbon non-methylene-interrupted dienoic fatty
   acids (NMIDs) in all tissue lipids. The NMID content varied among the
   different tissues and was influenced by the dietary lipid source. The
   hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) diet resulted in the greatest NMID
   content, while the lowest levels were seen in sea urchins fed diets
   containing a mixture of corn oil, linseed oil, menhaden oil and lecithin
   (CLnML). The NMID content was lowest in gut and highest in the shell.
   Significant levels of mead acid (20:3n-9) were detected in the shells of
   sea urchins fed the EFA-deficient diet (HCO). The enzymatic capabilities
   of sea urchins to desaturate and elongate 18:2n-6 to 20:4n-6 and 18:3n-3
   to 20:5n-3, as well as the capabilities to de novo synthesize NMID were
   hypothesized. Possible physiological roles and mechanisms for formation
   of NMID are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Title = {Vegetation and landform relationships at Ajusco volcano Mexico, using a

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between distribution of plant
   communities and landform properties, in an integrated
   (phyto-geomorphology) form, to define the best sites for reforestation
   on this highly stressed volcano located near Mexico City. Plant-landform
   units were determined through the interpretation of aerial photographs
   (1:20,000 scale), supported by fieldwork and GIs overlay procedures.
   Vegetation composition and structure analysis were performed using field
   data collected at 69 plots. A total of 89 species and three
   environmental variables (altitude, slope and aspect) were analyzed using
   multivariate classification and ordination analysis (TWINSPAN and DCA).
   A geographic information system was utilized for map digitization, for
   the generation of a digital elevation model (DEM) and for linking
   results of multivariate analysis to digital thematic information maps.
   Multivariate analysis identified eight community types defined by aspect
   and altitude conditions. The south and north slopes of this volcano
   showed important differences in vegetation, landforms and rock
   composition due to past processes (glacial at the north and periglacial
   at the south) and present conditions. Pine-grassland communities are
   more dominant on south and southeast-facing slopes, while fir
   communities are more dominant on north-facing slopes, particularly at
   lower elevations. A combination of spatial and multivariate analysis to
   study landform and vegetation was very useful to determine the best
   sites (convex slopes for pine and concave for fir species) for
   reforestation programs. An important advantage of this approach is that
   it allows relatively fast updating of vegetation maps with an
   appropriate balance between data accuracy and costs. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {One of the most constant and typical histological markers of thyroid
   papillary carcinoma is the presence of multilobated and ground-glass
   nuclei. With the intention of extending and characterizing the
   ultrastructural comprehension of this feature, thyroid papillary
   carcinoma cells and normal follicular cells were studied using chromatin
   and ribonucleoprotein preferential staining techniques, as well as
   immunolabeling with antibodies against DNA, lamins, vimentin, and
   desmin. Carcinoma cells showed scant compact chromatin arranged in small
   masses. A special type of nuclear bodies with DNA immunoreactive fibrils
   was found in these cells. Some nucleoli were surrounded by a double
   fibrillar layer limiting a perinucleolar space occupied by RNP
   fibrogranular structures that differed from those of normal nuclei.
   Perichromatin granules were scarce compared to normal follicular cells.
   Immunoelectron microscopic studies of lamins showed diminished
   immunoreactivity in the nuclei of carcinoma cells. A perinuclear
   distribution of desmin and vimentin filament was found in tumor cells.
   The cytoplasm of normal follicular cells showed scarce immunoreactivity
   to vimentin and no immunolabeling for desmin. Both types of filaments
   attach to the nuclear pore complex and to other regions of the nuclear
   envelope. Contacts between labeled filaments and desmosomes or
   hemidesmosomes were frequent. The results show that in papillary thyroid
   carcinoma cells, changes in the distribution of chromatin and
   ribonucleoproteins, either alone or in conjunction with scarce lamin
   immunolabeling and perinuclear vimentin and desmin filamentous rings,
   may be responsible for the characteristic ground glass and multilobated
   nuclei.},

Abstract = {Primary lung fibroblasts were isolated from patients with idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis (HIPF), from normal human lung tissue (NH), from rats
   treated with 75\% oxygen and paraquat (PA), and from normal adult rats
   (NR). Serum-free media conditioned by each fibroblast strain were tested
   on the human A549 cell line (HIPF and NH media) or on primary alveolar
   epithelial cells (AEC) isolated from normal adult rats (PA or NR media).
   Over 20-h incubation, HIPF- or PA-conditioned media induced DNA
   fragmentation and significant decreases in total recoverable DNA and
   cell number of A549 or AEC, respectively; NH or NR media had no
   significant effect relative to serum-free unconditioned media. Apoptosis
   of A549 and AEC was detected by altered nuclear morphology and was
   confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated bio-dUTP
   nick end labeling. The endonuclease inhibitors 10 mu M
   aurintricarboxylic acid and 50 mu M zinc inhibited HIPF-induced
   apoptosis of A549 cells by 68 and 71\%, respectively. Both apoptosis and
   necrosis were induced by HIPF and PA media in a concentration-dependent
   manner. These results suggest that altered fibroblasts emerging during
   fibrotic lung injury release a soluble factor(s) capable of inducing
   cell death and net loss of AEC.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Nucleoplasmic structural constituents observed in partially decondensed
   nuclei of the central nervous system of the rat were analyzed by
   postembedding immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies specifically
   recognizing heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and small
   nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes and DNA. Fibrogranular RNP
   structures (polyparticles) were found in close proximity to DNA
   containing fibrillar areas resulting from partial dispersion of compact
   chromatin, The polyparticle-type fibrils are labeled by antibodies
   recognizing hnRNP core proteins as well as snRNPs (Sm antigen or 70 kDa
   protein of U1snRNP) or the m(3)G-cap structure of snRNAs, These
   observations suggest that such polyparticle-type fibrils correspond to
   extended perichromatin fibrils. Partially decondensed perichromatin
   granules are rarely labeled by anti-snRNP or snRNA antibodies. When
   labeling occurs it is restricted to the periphery of the granules.
   However, anti-hnRNP antibodies frequently label these granules, Our
   results favor the idea, previously proposed for Balbiani ring granules,
   that perichromatin granules are formed by the folding of hnRNP
   containing perichromatin fibrils (polyparticles) in the process of
   splicing, and that mature perichromatin granules contain already spliced
   messenger RNA.},

Journal = {ACTA ANATOMICA},
Year = {1983},
Volume = {116},

Abstract = {The structural alterations produced by transection in striated fibers of
   cremaster muscle are studied with light microscopy and EM. Diffusion of
   procion yellow and procion black, which are extracellular space markers,
   is observed after incubating the transected fibers in the presence or in
   the absence of Ca2+ for 1 h. Cytoplasm at the injured end is always
   separated from the extracellular space by the sarcolemmal membrane. No
   outflow of cytoplasmic structures can be seen with light microscopy or
   EM. The zone of muscle fiber adjacent to the transection is generally
   dilated. It is occupied by a meshwork of 7-nm-thick filaments. No normal
   myofibrils are present. The diffusion of procion markers comes to an end
   within 1 h after the lesion if the fiber is incubated in normal Krebs''
   solution. In this period of time, they penetrate 250-350 .mu.m inside
   the fibers. When the transected fibers are incubated in a Ca2-free
   solution, procion dyes penetrate .apprx. 1 mm. This distance increases
   in the following 3 h. Diaphragm muscle fibers are used as controls. In
   these fibers the free penetration of the markers by the injured end is
   not impeded by Ca2+. These results are in accordance with the
   Ca-dependent recuperation of the membrane potential 1 h after the
   transection in cremaster muscle fibers and with the absence of this
   recuperation in the diaphragm. Evidently, the closure of the sarcolemmal
   membrane creates the diffusion barrier blocking the penetration of
   markers and ions, allowing the recuperation of membrane potential.},

Abstract = {The fine structure of the striated muscle fibers of the cremaster of the
   guinea pig was studied using the cholinesterase technique and light
   microscopy and EM. Under light microscopy, isolated single muscle fibers
   showed 2 types of nerve endings: the 1st presented elliptic or oval
   areas having digit-like structures inside, some of the borders of which
   were heavily stained. These fibers had only 1 end-plate. The 2nd type
   presented elongated clear areas with most of the density located on the
   borders. Several nerve endings were apparent in these fibers. By EM, the
   former had large and numerous sarcolemmal foldings and these
   characteristics were also observed in unstained fibers. In the latter,
   the foldings were scanty or absent. At the ultrastructural level, the
   fibers having only 1 end-plate presented a regular array of fibrils with
   an abundant sarcoplasmic reticulum (Fibrillenstruktur type) in contrast
   to the multi-innervated fiber with an irregular distribution pattern of
   fibrils and a scarce sarcoplasmic reticulum (Felderstruktur type). The
   striated muscle fiber layer of the cremaster probably contains both fast
   and slow fibers. The possible functional role for the slow striated
   muscle fibers is discussed.},

Title = {Freshwater macrophyte type (macroalgae versus phanerogams) mainly
   determines detritus-derived greenhouse gases production: A microcosm
   experiment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {674-689},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are crucial in the global emissions of greenhouse
   gases (GHGs) such as CH4. Macrophytes are the main organic matter (i.e.,
   detritus) supplier to the sediment of these systems, thus controlling
   CH4 production. However, species-specific differences (structure and
   composition) may determine contrasting patterns of detritus
   transformation into CH4. Furthermore, eutrophication can affect the
   degradation and, consequently, CH4 production. We performed a 64-day
   microcosm experiment with anoxic incubations of detritus from seven
   phylogenetically different macrophytes (two charophytes, filamentous
   algae -Spirogyra, Cladophora-, three submerged plants and an amphibious
   one), under two trophic conditions (oligo- versus eutrophic) and
   with/without sediment. We assessed the CH4 and CO2 production and the
   changes in the detritus quality at the end of the experiment. The
   ranking in the mean cumulative CH4 production was: Chara hispida >
   Nitella hyalina > Najas marina approximate to Teucrium scordium >
   Stuckenia pectinata approximate to Myriophyllum spicatum > filamentous
   algae, and it was related to the detritus quality. GHGs maximum
   production rates were 1.6 (N. marina)-1.2 (C. hispida) mmol CH4/(g
   OC<middle dot>day) and 1.7 (N. marina)-1.5 (C. hispida) mmol CO2/(g
   OC<middle dot>day). The CO2:CH4 ratio was biased towards CO2 during the
   first 10 days (average ratio of 200) and fell afterwards to about 1 for
   all macrophyte species and treatments. The sediment favored detritus
   decomposition (probably due to the ``positive priming effect{''}),
   increasing GHGs production. The influence of nutrient enrichment was not
   evident. Delving into the macrophyte detritus quality-GHGs production
   relationship is needed to forecast the GHGs emissions in
   macrophyte-dominated systems.},

Title = {Evolutionary algorithms applied to minimize the thermal transport in
   atomic nanoribbons},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {260},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, the development of
   materials with tailored transport properties is essential for enhancing
   device performance. In thermoelectric applications, materials with low
   thermal conductivity are particularly desirable to improve the
   dimensionless figure of merit and the efficiency of the Seebeck effect.
   In this study, we present an atomistic investigation of lattice thermal
   transport in a binary nanoribbon composed of alternating atomic blocks
   with a rock-salt structure, coupled to semi-infinite reservoirs at both
   ends. Using the Born interatomic potential within the harmonic
   approximation and the lattice thermal Kubo-Greenwood formula based on
   Green's function techniques, we simulate phonon transport at the atomic
   scale. The accuracy of this approach depends critically on the selection
   of interatomic potential parameters. To address this, we apply
   evolutionary algorithms, specifically Differential Evolution, to
   optimize atomic masses and force constants in order to minimize the
   lattice thermal conductivity. These algorithms efficiently explore
   high-dimensional parameter spaces and identify optimal configurations
   corresponding to global or near-global minima. Our results, supported by
   ab initio calculations for real materials with a rock-salt structure,
   demonstrate an effective strategy for engineering
   low-thermal-conductivity materials, which are desirable for the design
   of high-performance thermoelectric devices.},

Title = {Proposal for the Application of Fractional Operators in Polynomial
   Regression Models to Enhance the Determination Coefficient
   R2 on Unseen Data},
Journal = {FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Since polynomial regression models are generally quite reliable for data
   that can be handled using a linear system, it is important to note that
   in some cases, they may suffer from overfitting during the training
   phase. This can lead to negative values of the coefficient of
   determination R2 when applied to unseen data. To address this issue,
   this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in
   polynomial regression models to construct a fractional regression model.
   The aim of this approach is to mitigate overfitting, which could
   potentially improve the R2 value for unseen data compared to the
   conventional polynomial model, under the assumption that this could lead
   to predictive models with better performance. The methodology for
   constructing these fractional regression models is presented along with
   examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional
   operators, where some results show that regions with initially negative
   or near-zero R2 values exhibit remarkable improvements after the
   application of the fractional operator, with absolute relative increases
   exceeding 800\% on unseen data. Finally, the importance of employing
   sets in the construction of the fractional regression model within this
   methodological framework is emphasized, since from a theoretical
   standpoint, one could construct an uncountable family of fractional
   operators derived from the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo definitions
   that, although differing in their formulation, would yield the same
   regression results as those shown in the examples presented in this
   work.},

Title = {Effects of melatonin on in vitro oocyte maturation and

Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Background and Aim: In vitro fertilization (IVF) efficiency in pigs
   remains suboptimal, partly due to oxidative stress during oocyte
   maturation and embryo development. Melatonin (MLT), an endogenous
   antioxidant, has been proposed as a beneficial supplement in
   reproductive culture systems. This study aimed to evaluate the effects
   of different concentrations of MLT on in vitro porcine oocyte maturation
   and subsequent embryo development. Materials and Methods: Ovaries were
   obtained from prepubertal gilts at a local slaughterhouse. A total of
   1142 cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COC) were allocated into four groups and
   matured in vitro with 0, 1, 3, or 5 mu M MLT for 44 h. Oocyte maturation
   was assessed using aceto-orcein staining and viability with trypan blue
   staining. Subsequently, 1312 COC underwent IVF using a standardized
   sperm concentration, followed by embryo culture in North Carolina State
   University-23 medium supplemented with corresponding MLT concentrations
   for 8 days. Embryo development was classified according to cleavage,
   morula, and early blastocyst stages. Data were analyzed using analysis
   of variance with Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05). Results: Although
   supplementation with 1.0 <mu>M MLT resulted in the highest metaphase II
   oocyte maturation rate (45.9\% +/- 5.70\%) and blastocyst formation
   (26.9\% +/- 9.57\%), no significant differences were observed among
   treatments in either oocyte maturation, COC viability, or embryo
   development stages (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Supplementation with 0-5 mu M
   MLT during oocyte maturation and embryo culture did not significantly
   enhance in vitro maturation rates or embryonic developmental outcomes in
   pigs. Further investigations are warranted to optimize MLT
   concentrations and elucidate its mechanistic role during porcine oocyte
   and embryo in vitro culture.},

Title = {Dynamic Response of Heart Rate Variability to Active Standing in Aortic
   Valve Disease: Insights from Recurrence Quantification Analysis},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction: Aortic valve disease (AVD) is an inflammatory, lipid
   infiltration and calcification disease that has been associated with
   changes in the conventional linear heart rate variability (HRV) indices
   showing a marked shift towards sympathetic predominance and a
   deterioration of the autonomic control. Objective: To explore the HRV
   dynamics in AVD patients through nonlinear methods by recurrence
   quantification analysis (RQA). Methods: In total, 127 subjects
   participated in a cross-sectional study categorized into three groups:
   healthy valve (HV), aortic valve sclerosis (AVSc), and aortic valve
   stenosis (AVS), as determined by echocardiographic assessment. HRV data
   were collected from five-minute ECG recordings at both a supine position
   and active standing. RQA indices were calculated using the Cross
   Recurrence Plot Toolbox. Results: In the supine position, patients with
   AVS exhibited larger determinism and trapping time than those with AVSc
   and HV. The analysis of these differences revealed that determinism and
   laminarity increased progressively from HV to AVS. In the same way, the
   magnitude of change (Delta) between positions decreased and presented
   the lowest values in AVS in most of the nonlinear indices. Conclusion:
   RQA indices of HRV in AVD patients indicate a rigidizing dynamic
   characterized by larger determinism and extended trapping times in fewer
   system states in relation to the severity of AVD. These findings
   establish a precedent for future perspective assessments for the
   implementation of these methods in medical software or devices.},

Abstract = {Background The transmission of hantaviruses through rodents has been
   associated with the development of severe illnesses, including
   Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (CPS) and Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome
   (HFRS). Environmental changes impacting rodent populations affect their
   global distribution. These are severe diseases, potentially lethal, and
   widespread, making them a public health issue.Objective Computational
   studies were conducted to better understand the envelope glycoproteins
   that are expressed by Hantavirus, which produce the cardiopulmonary
   syndrome and the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.Methods The
   glycoprotein sequences were found through the utilization of specific
   computational tools, including the Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition
   (PIDP), Polarity Index Method Profile 3.0v (PIM 3.0v), and genomics
   software.Results Examining the PIM 3.0v profile and the PIDP profile
   revealed distinct patterns in the envelope glycoproteins of different
   genotypes of Hantavirus. These patterns allowed for structural and
   morphological similarities to be identified. In particular, the PIM 3.0v
   profile shows that it is possible to discriminate between CPS and HFRS
   groups, and the PIDP profile shows the existence of an overlaid disorder
   profile of glycoproteins N and C from Hantavirus strains associated with
   CPS and HFRS.Conclusion Using the PIM 3.0v profile, our computer
   programs were able to identify isolates of Hantavirus envelope
   glycoproteins associated with cardiopulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic
   fever with renal syndrome. We believe this research contributes to a
   deeper comprehension of these emerging viruses.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This work presents strong evidence supporting the use of decellularized
   human iliac arteries combined with adipose tissue-derived stem cells
   (hASCs) as a promising alternative for vascular tissue engineering,
   opening the path to future treatments for peripheral artery disease
   (PAD). PAD is a progressive condition with high rates of amputation and
   mortality due to ischemic damage and limited graft options. Traditional
   synthetic grafts often fail due to poor integration, while autologous
   grafts may be unsuitable for patients with compromised vascular health.
   This study explores the potential of decellularized human iliac arteries
   as scaffolds for vascular grafts, focusing on preserving extracellular
   matrix (ECM) ultrastructure while minimizing immunogenic response. A
   perfusion-based protocol with enzymatic and detergent agents effectively
   removed cellular material, resulting in scaffolds with preserved ECM
   architecture, including organized collagen and elastin fibers. To assess
   scaffold bioactivity, hASCs were seeded onto the decellularized ECM,
   demonstrating high viability. Structural assessments, including
   histological staining and mechanical testing, confirmed that
   decellularized arteries retained their hierarchical structure and
   exhibited increased stiffness, suggesting an adaptive realignment of ECM
   fibers. Thermal and ultrastructural analyses further showed that
   decellularized scaffolds maintained stability and integrity comparable
   to native tissue, underscoring their durability for clinical
   applications. The human iliac artery shows potential as a vascular
   scaffold due to its accessibility and the ability to support the
   viability of hASC. Future research will emphasize in vivo validation and
   strategies for functional recellularization to evaluate the clinical
   viability of these engineered vascular grafts.},

Title = {Modulation of Brain Kynurenic Acid by N-Acetylcysteine Prevents
   Cognitive Impairment and Muscular Weakness Induced by Cisplatin in
   Female Rats},
Journal = {CELLS},

Abstract = {Cisplatin (CIS) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent primarily used to
   treat hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, including lymphomas,
   sarcomas, and some carcinomas. Patients receiving this treatment for
   tumors outside the nervous system develop cognitive impairment.
   Alterations in the kynurenine pathway (KP) following CIS treatment
   suggest that certain KP metabolites may cross the blood-brain barrier,
   leading to increased production of the neuromodulator kynurenic acid
   (KYNA), which is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aimed
   to evaluate the effects of modulating brain KYNA levels by the
   administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an inhibitor of kynurenine
   aminotransferase II (KATII), an enzyme responsible for KYNA biosynthesis
   on the cognitive and neuromuscular deficits induced by CIS. Female
   Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, NAC (300 mg/day/8
   days), CIS (3 mg/kg i.p/5 days), and NAC + CIS (both treatments
   co-administered in parallel). Seven days after the last CIS
   administration, cognitive performance, muscle strength, brain KYNA
   levels, KATII activity, and brain tissue redox profile (lipid
   peroxidation and oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio) were
   assessed. CIS did not affect short-term memory but induced long-term
   memory deficits and reduced muscle strength, effects which were
   prevented by NAC co-administration. CIS decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio and
   the number of cells in the brain cortex while it increased lipid
   peroxidation, KYNA levels, and marginal KATII activity. All these
   effects were attenuated by the co-administration of NAC. These findings
   suggest that NAC mitigates the side effects of CIS, such as chemo-brain
   and muscle weakness, by improving the redox imbalance and modulating
   KYNA levels by limiting its non-enzymatic production by reactive oxygen
   species (ROS).},

Title = {Resveratrol inhibits Lin28A expression and induces its degradation via
   the proteasomal pathway in NCCIT cells},
Journal = {ONCOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lin28A is an oncoprotein overexpressed in several cancer types such as
   testicular, ovarian, colon, breast and lung cancers. As a pluripotency
   factor that promotes tumorigenesis, Lin28A is associated with more
   undifferentiated and aggressive tumors phenotypes. Moreover, Lin28A is a
   highly stable protein that is difficult to downregulate. The compound
   resveratrol (RSV) has anticancer effects. The present study aimed to
   elucidate the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of Lin28A protein
   expression by RSV in the NCCIT cell line. NCCIT cells were treated with
   different concentrations of RSV to investigate its effects on Lin28A
   expression. The mRNA expression levels of Lin28A and ubiquitin-specific
   protease 28 (USP28) were assessed using reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR. Western blot analysis was employed to
   evaluate the protein levels of Lin28A, USP28 and phosphorylated Lin28A.
   In addition, in some experiments, cells were treated with a MAPK/ERK
   pathway inhibitor, and other experiments involved transfecting cells
   with small interfering RNAs targeting USP28. The results demonstrated
   that RSV significantly reduced Lin28A expression by destabilizing the
   protein; this effect was mediated by the ability of RSV to suppress the
   expression of USP28, a deubiquitinase that normally protects Lin28A from
   ubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, RSV inhibited
   phosphorylation of Lin28A via the MAPK/ERK pathway; this phosphorylation
   event has previously been shown to enhance the stability of Lin28A by
   increasing its half-life. This resulted in Lin28A degradation through
   the proteasomal pathway in NCCIT cells. The results provide further
   evidence of the anticancer activity of RSV, and identified Lin28A and
   USP28 as promising therapeutic targets. As a stable oncoprotein,
   downregulating Lin28A expression is challenging. However, the present
   study demonstrated that RSV can overcome this hurdle by inhibiting USP28
   expression and MAPK/ERK signaling to promote Lin28A degradation.
   Furthermore, elucidating these mechanisms provides avenues for
   developing targeted cancer therapies.},

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS},

Volume = {202},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {n-gram profiles have been successfully and widely used to analyse long
   sequences of potentially differing lengths for clustering or
   classification. Mainly, machine learning algorithms have been used for
   this purpose but, despite their predictive performance, these methods
   cannot discover hidden structures or provide a full probabilistic
   representation of the data. A novel class of Bayesian generative models
   designed for n-gram profiles used as binary attributes have been
   designed to address this. The flexibility of the proposed modelling
   allows to consider a straightforward approach to feature selection in
   the generative model. Furthermore, a slice sampling algorithm is derived
   for a fast inferential procedure, which is applied to synthetic and real
   data scenarios and shows that feature selection can improve
   classification accuracy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {121},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although coffee is one of the most popular beverages, the relationship
   between chronic consumption and cardiovascular health remains
   controversial. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of chronic
   consumption of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee on biochemical
   profile and cardiovascular response. Three groups of rats were treated
   with HPLC characterized caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee and control
   for six weeks; blood pressure and biochemical profile were analyzed,
   followed by in vitro aortic ring experiments. The results showed that
   both coffees reduced blood glucose, AST and ALT. However, only
   caffeinated coffee elevated blood pressure in vivo, whereas aortic rings
   with endothelium increased the vasocontractile response; this effect was
   reversed by the addition of indomethacin and L-NAME also reduced the
   endothelium-mediated vasodilator response. In conclusion, chronic intake
   of any type of coffee positively improves biochemical profile. However,
   caffeinated coffee reduces nitric oxide biosynthesis and increases
   vasoconstrictor prostanoid production, whereas decaffeinated coffee
   preserves vascular function.},

Title = {Molecular Mimicry between Toxoplasma gondii B-Cell Epitopes and
   Neurodevelopmental Proteins: An Immunoinformatic Approach},

Abstract = {Epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have shown a strong
   association between high seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii)
   and schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients showed higher levels of
   anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulins M and G (IgM and IgG) when compared to
   healthy controls. Previously, in a rat model, we demonstrated that the
   progeny of mothers immunized with T. gondii lysates before gestation had
   behavioral and social impairments during adulthood. Therefore, we
   suggested that T. gondii infection can trigger autoreactivity by
   molecularly mimicking host brain proteins. Here, we aimed to identify
   the occurrence of antigenic mimicry between T. gondii epitopes and host
   brain proteins. Using a bioinformatic approach, we predicted T. gondii
   RH-88 B cell epitopes and compared them to human cell-surface proteins
   involved in brain development and differentiation (BrainS). Five
   different algorithms for B-cell-epitope prediction were used and
   compared, resulting in 8584 T. gondii epitopes. We then compared T.
   gondii predicted epitopes to BrainS proteins by local sequence
   alignments using BLASTP. T. gondii immunogenic epitopes significantly
   overlapped with 42 BrainS proteins. Among these overlapping proteins
   essential for brain development and differentiation, we identified HSP90
   and NOTCH receptors as the proteins most likely to be targeted by the
   maternally generated pathogenic antibodies due to their topological
   overlap at the extracellular region of their sequence. This analysis
   highlights the relevance of pregestational clinical surveillance and
   screening for potential pathogenic anti-T. gondii antibodies. It also
   identifies potential targets for the design of vaccines that could
   prevent behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with
   pre-gestational T. gondii exposure.},

Abstract = {Background Marburg virus (MARV), which is spread by one species of fruit
   bats, can cause deadly Marburg virus disease (MVD, also known as Marburg
   hemorrhagic fever, MHF), which is a severe form of viral hemorrhagic
   fever with symptoms similar to Ebola. MARV is considered to be very
   dangerous, and there are no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments
   for Marburg disease.Objective Computational studies were conducted to
   comprehend the envelope glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 expressed by the
   Marburg virus.Methods Determination of the predicted intrinsic disorder
   predisposition of each glycoprotein sequence (PIDP) and the Polarity
   Index Method Profile 3.0v (PIM 3.0v) using genomics software and
   multiple computer algorithms, several of which have been specifically
   designed for this purpose.Results The PIM 3.0v and PIDP profiles showed
   different MARV envelope glycoprotein patterns. These patterns revealed
   structural and morphological commonalities.Conclusions Our computer
   systems were able to identify MARV envelope glycoprotein isolates using
   the PIM 3.0v profile, and they suggest that they can be used as a

Abstract = {Background Rodents and many wild and domestic animals, including cattle,
   donkeys, goats, hares, ostriches, and sheep, spread the Crimean-Congo
   Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV), acting as hosts for infected ticks
   primarily of the Hyalomma genus, which serve as vectors and reservoirs
   of the virus. CCHF is a severe, potentially lethal, and widespread
   disease, making it a serious public health issue. Environmental changes
   impacting rodent populations affect their global distribution and,
   therefore, play a role in the spread of CCHFV.Objective This study aims
   togain a deeper understanding of the envelope glycoproteins expressed by
   the CCHFV.Methods Multiple computational algorithms determined the
   Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition (PIDP), Polarity Index, and genomic
   profiles of each sequence of the glycoproteins.Results When examining
   the Polarity Index Method Profile, 3.0v profile, and the PIDP profile,
   the envelope glycoproteins of the CCHFV showed different patterns. With
   these patterns, it was possible to identify structural and morphological
   similarities.Conclusion With the PIM 3.0v profile, our computer programs
   were able to identify isolated CCHFV envelope glycoproteins. We believe
   that this research provides a deeper understanding of this virus.},

Abstract = {The development of anthropic activities during recent years has led to
   an increase in nutrient fluxes in the R \& iacute;o Grande de Comit \&
   aacute;n and Montebello Lakes National Park, Mexico. In turn, this has
   modified the dynamics of the biotic community, specifically favoring the
   presence of cyanobacteria tolerant to contamination. The continual and
   massive presence of Planktothrix species (spp.) in the system suggests a
   potential detrimental impact for economic issues and human health. In
   this study, we identify the morphological and molecular characteristics
   of Planktothrix populations from seven tropical (1,380-1,740 masl,
   23.0-25.5 degrees C) and calcareous lakes and two ponds from a water
   treatment plant. We also assess the ecological drivers that could be
   related to the presence of cyanotoxins in the system. The ecological
   preferences, morphology, 16S rRNA structure, and 16S-23S rRNA internal
   transcribed spacer found evidence for three species: P. agardhii
   distributed in neutral to slightly basic water (pH = 7.7-8.7), and P.
   spiroides and Planktothrix sp. in alkaline waters (pH = 9.1). The
   presence of the mcyE gene and its validation by liquid chromatography
   confirmed the presence of two microcystin variants (MC-RR and MC-LR) in
   at least three populations of P. agardhii. These microcystins put the
   health of the ecosystem and its inhabitants at risk, a condition that
   should be addressed and resolved with a water management and
   detoxification strategy in the basin.},

Abstract = {Several types of cytotoxic insults disrupt endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
   homeostasis, cause ER stress, and activate the unfolded protein response
   (UPR). The role of ER stress and UPR activation in hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis (HP) has not been described. HP is an immune-mediated
   interstitial lung disease that develops following repeated inhalation of
   various antigens in susceptible and sensitized individuals. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the lung expression and localization of
   the key effectors of the UPR, BiP/GRP78, CHOP, and sXBP1 in HP patients
   compared with control subjects. Furthermore, we developed a mouse model
   of HP to determine whether ER stress and UPR pathway are induced during
   this pathogenesis. In human control lungs, we observed weak positive
   staining for BiP in some epithelial cells and macrophages, while sXBP1
   and CHOP were negative. Conversely, strong BiP, sXBP1- and CHOP-positive
   alveolar and bronchial epithelial, and inflammatory cells were
   identified in HP lungs. We also found apoptosis and autophagy markers
   colocalization with UPR proteins in HP lungs. Similar results were
   obtained in lungs from an HP mouse model. Our findings suggest that the
   UPR pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of HP:},

Title = {An Accurate Explicit Six-Parameter Solar Cell Model Based on
   Single-Diode and Its Parameter Extraction for Seven Photovoltaic
   Technologies},

Abstract = {The mathematical modeling of solar cells and panels is critical in many
   photovoltaic applications. However, the standard single-diode solar cell
   model, commonly selected to model these devices, is implicit and
   difficult to integrate into simulation software. Therefore, exact
   explicit solutions of this model, more suitable for computing purposes,
   have been proposed based on the Lambert W-function. This work introduces
   an explicit single-diode, easy-to-use six-parameter solar cell model.
   The proposed model is formulated with elementary functions. The model is
   developed and tested over seven photovoltaic technologies as an
   alternative to traditional approaches. Results of the extensive
   comparison of the three models (implicit, explicit Lambert W, and
   explicit six-parameter) show that the proposed approach is more accurate
   (14.81\% relative improvement on average compared to the traditional
   methods), almost as fast as the Lambert W approach and much faster than
   the implicit approach. Due to its simplicity and accuracy, the proposed
   model will become an alternative in photovoltaic applications such as
   energy prediction and maximum power point tracking.},

Title = {Chaotic vortex-induced rotation of an elliptical cylinder},
Journal = {CHAOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Non-linear oscillations of an elliptical cylinder, which can rotate
   about an axis that passes through its symmetry axle due to a torsional
   spring and hydrodynamic torque produced by the flow of a Newtonian
   fluid, were analyzed in terms of a single parameter that compares vortex
   shedding frequency with the torsional spring's natural frequency. The
   governing equations for the flow coupled with a rigid body with one
   degree of freedom were solved numerically using the lattice-Boltzmann
   method. The Reynolds number used was R e = 200, which, in the absence of
   torsional spring, produces chaotic oscillations of the elliptical
   cylinder. When the torsional spring is included, we identified three
   branches separated by transition regions when stiffness of the
   restorative torque changes, as in the case of vortex-induced vibrations.
   However, in this case, several regions presenting chaotic dynamics were
   identified. Two regions with stable limit cycles were found when both
   torques synchronized and when stiffness of the torsional spring is big
   enough so that the ellipse's oscillation is small.},

Title = {Association between serum trace element, mineral, and amino acid levels

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {83},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The objective of the present study is assessment of serum trace element
   and amino acid levels in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
   patients with subsequent evaluation of its independent associations with
   markers of liver injury and metabolic risk. Materials and methods: 140
   women aged 20-90 years old with diagnosed NAFLD and 140 healthy women
   with a respective age range were enrolled in the current study. Analysis
   of serum and hair levels of trace elements and minerals was performed
   with inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS). Serum amino
   acid concentrations were evaluated by high-pressure liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) with UV-detection. In addition, routine
   biochemical parameters including liver damage markers, alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT) and gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT), were assessed
   spectrophotometrically. Results: The findings demonstrated that patients
   with NAFLD were characterized by higher ALT, GGT, lactate dehydrogenase
   (LDH) and cholinesterase (CE) activity, as well as increased levels of
   total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides,
   and uric acid. NAFLD patients were characterized by reduced serum and
   hair Co, Se, and Zn levels, as well as hair Cu content and serum Mn
   concentrations in comparison to controls. Circulating Ala, Cit, Glu,
   Gly, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Tyr levels in NAFLD patients exceeded those in
   the control group. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that serum
   and hair trace element levels were significantly associated with
   circulating amino acid levels after adjustment for age, BMI, and
   metabolic parameters including liver damage markers. Conclusion: It is
   proposed that altered trace element handling may contribute to NAFLD
   pathogenesis through modulation of amino acid metabolism.},

Title = {Conduct and reporting of multivariate network meta-analyses: a scoping
   review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {166},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: Combining multivariate and network meta -analysis methods
   simultaneously in a multivariate network meta -analysis (MVNMA) provides
   the methodological framework to analyze the largest amount of evidence
   relevant to decision-makers (i.e., from indirect evidence and correlated
   outcomes). The objectives of this scoping review were to summarize the
   characteristics of MVNMAs published in the health sciences literature
   and map the methodological guidance available for MVNMA. Study Design
   and Setting: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to
   Nursing and Allied Health Literature from inception to 28 August 2023,
   along with citations of included studies, for quantitative evidence
   syntheses that applied MVNMA and articles addressing MVNMA methods.
   Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible studies.
   Collected data included bibliographic, methodological, and analytical
   characteristics of included studies. We reported results as total
   numbers, frequencies, and percentages for categorical variables and
   medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables that were not
   normally distributed. Results: After screening 1,075 titles and
   abstracts, and 112 full texts, we included 38 unique studies, of which,
   10 were quantitative evidence syntheses that applied MVNMA and 28 were
   articles addressing MVNMA methods. Among the 10 MVNMAs, the first was
   published in 2013, four used studies identified from already published
   systematic reviews, and eight addressed pharmacological interventions,
   which were the most common interventions. They evaluated interventions
   for metastatic melanoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, oral
   hygiene, disruptive behavior disorders, rheumatoid arthritis,
   narcolepsy, type 2 diabetes, and overactive bladder syndrome. Five
   MVNMAs analyzed two outcomes simultaneously, and four MVNMAs analyzed
   three outcomes simultaneously. Among the articles addressing MVNMA
   methods, the first was published in 2007 and the majority provided
   methodological frameworks for conducting MVNMAs (26/28, 93\%). One study
   proposed criteria to standardize reporting of MVNMAs and two proposed
   items relevant to the quality assessment of MVNMAs. Study authors used
   data from 18 different illnesses to provide illustrative examples within
   their methodological guidance. Conclusions: The application of MVNMA in
   the health sciences literature is uncommon. Many methodological
   frameworks are published; however, standardization and specific criteria
   to guide reporting and quality assessment are lacking. This overview of
   the current landscape may help inform future conduct of MVNMAs and
   research on MVNMA methods. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Background Previously restricted to remote areas of Central and Western
   Africa, the MPOX virus-based disease, also known as monkeypox, has now
   spread to more than 90 countries and has become endemic. As a
   consequence, the MPOX virus has become a global public health
   concern.Objective The objective of this study was to conduct a
   computational-multiparametric study (at the genomic and proteomic
   levels) of the biological sequences that express the MPOX virus
   envelopes in order to fathom the physicochemical regularities of these
   proteins.Methods Using computer programs, we determined the polarity
   index method (PIM) profile and protein intrinsic disorder predisposition
   (PIDP) for each studied protein.Results The UniProt database was able to
   identify sequences similar to those of the MPOX virus expressed thanks
   to the computational regularities found in the virus' envelope
   sequences.Conclusion The polarity index method and protein intrinsic
   disorder predisposition profiles could aid in elucidating the
   sequence-level structural regularities of the MPOX virus envelopes.},

Title = {Role of vitamins beyond vitamin D3 in bone health and
   osteoporosis (Review)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The objective of the present review was to summarize the molecular
   mechanisms associated with the effects of the vitamins A, C, E and K,
   and group B vitamins on bone and their potential roles in the
   development of osteoporosis. Epidemiological findings have demonstrated
   an association between vitamin deficiency and a higher risk of
   developing osteoporosis; vitamins are positively related to bone health
   upon their intake at the physiological range. Excessive vitamin intake
   can also adversely affect bone formation, as clearly demonstrated for
   vitamin A. Vitamins E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), K-2 (menaquinones
   4 and 7) and C have also been shown to promote osteoblast development
   through bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad and Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling, as well as the TGF beta/Smad pathway (alpha-tocopherol).
   Vitamin A metabolite (all-trans retinoic acid) exerts both inhibitory
   and stimulatory effects on BMP- and Wnt/beta-catenin-mediated
   osteogenesis at the nanomolar and micromolar range, respectively.
   Certain vitamins significantly reduce receptor activator of nuclear
   factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) production and RANKL/RANK signaling, while
   increasing the level of osteoprotegerin (OPG), thus reducing the
   RANKL/OPG ratio and exerting anti-osteoclastogenic effects. Ascorbic
   acid can both promote and inhibit RANKL signaling, being essential for
   osteoclastogenesis. Vitamin K-2 has also been shown to prevent vascular
   calcification by activating matrix Gla protein through its
   carboxylation. Therefore, the maintenance of a physiological intake of
   vitamins should be considered as a nutritional strategy for the
   prevention of osteoporosis.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the construction of a family of radial functions
   aimed at emulating the behavior of the radial basis function known as
   thin plate spline (TPS). Additionally, a method is proposed for applying
   fractional derivatives, both partially and fully, to these functions for
   use in interpolation problems. Furthermore, a technique is employed to
   precondition the matrices generated in the presented problems through QR
   decomposition. Similarly, a method is introduced to define two different
   types of abelian groups for any fractional operator defined in the
   interval {[}0,1), among which the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral,
   Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, and Caputo fractional
   derivative are worth mentioning. Finally, a form of radial interpolant
   is suggested for application in solving fractional differential
   equations using the asymmetric collocation method, and examples of its
   implementation in differential operators utilizing the aforementioned
   fractional operators are shown.},

Title = {Enhancing Long-Term Wind Power Forecasting by Using an Intelligent
   Statistical Treatment for Wind Resource Data},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wind power is an important energy source that can be used to supply
   clean energy and meet current energy needs. Despite its advantages in
   terms of zero emissions, its main drawback is its intermittency.
   Deterministic approaches to forecast wind power generation based on the
   annual average wind speed are usually used; however, statistical
   treatments are more appropriate. In this paper, an intelligent
   statistical methodology to forecast annual wind power is proposed. The
   seasonality of wind is determined via a clustering analysis of monthly
   wind speed probabilistic distribution functions (PDFs) throughout n
   years. Subsequently, a methodology to build the wind resource typical
   year (WRTY) for the n+1 year is introduced to characterize the resource
   into the so-called statistical seasons (SSs). Then, the wind energy
   produced at each SS is calculated using its PDFs. Finally, the
   forecasted annual energy for the n+1 year is given as the sum of the
   produced energies in the SSs. A wind farm in Mexico is chosen as a case
   study. The SSs, WRTY, and seasonal and annual generated energies are
   estimated and validated. Additionally, the forecasted annual wind energy
   for the n+1 year is calculated deterministically from the n year. The
   results are compared with the measured data, and the former are more
   accurate.},

Title = {Modulation of Kynurenic Acid Production by N-acetylcysteine Prevents
   Cognitive Impairment in Adulthood Induced by Lead Exposure during
   Lactation in Mice},
Journal = {ANTIOXIDANTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lead (Pb2+) exposure during early life induces cognitive impairment,
   which was recently associated with an increase in brain kynurenic acid
   (KYNA), an antagonist of NMDA and alpha-7 nicotinic receptors. It has
   been described that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) favors an antioxidant
   environment and inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase II activity (KAT
   II, the main enzyme of KYNA production), leading to brain KYNA levels
   decrease and cognitive improvement. This study aimed to investigate
   whether the NAC modulation of the brain KYNA levels in mice ameliorated
   Pb2+-induced cognitive impairment. The dams were divided into four
   groups: Control, Pb2+, NAC, and Pb2++NAC, which were given drinking
   water or 500 ppm lead acetate in the drinking water ad libitum, from 0
   to 23 postnatal days (PNDs). The NAC and Pb2++NAC groups were
   simultaneously fed NAC (350 mg/day) in their chow from 0 to 23 PNDs. At
   PND 60, the effect of the treatment with Pb2+ and in combination with
   NAC on learning and memory performance was evaluated. Immediately after
   behavioral evaluation, brain tissues were collected to assess the redox
   environment; KYNA and glutamate levels; and KAT II activity. The NAC
   treatment prevented the long-term memory deficit exhibited in the Pb2+
   group. As expected, Pb2+ group showed redox environment alterations,
   fluctuations in glutamate levels, and an increase in KYNA levels, which
   were partially avoided by NAC co-administration. These results confirmed
   that the excessive KYNA levels induced by Pb2+ were involved in the
   onset of cognitive impairment and could be successfully prevented by NAC
   treatment. NAC could be a tool for testing in scenarios in which KYNA
   levels are associated with the induction of cognitive impairment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we review some grid quality metrics and define some new

   to the minimum value of the energy density over the grid. We also define
   new discrete functionals, which are implemented as objective functions
   in an optimization-based method for quadrilateral grid generation and
   improvement. These functionals are linearly combined with a discrete
   functional whose domain has an infinite barrier at the boundary of the
   set of unfolded grids to preserve convex grid cells in each step of the

Title = {From Mechanisms to Implications: Understanding the Molecular
   Neurotoxicity of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are widely produced and used
   nanoparticles. Yet, TiO2NP exposure may possess toxic effects to
   different cells and tissues, including the brain. Recent studies
   significantly expanded the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
   underlying TiO2NP neurotoxicity implicating a number of both direct and
   indirect mechanisms. In view of the significant recent progress in
   research on TiO2NP neurotoxicity, the objective of the present study is
   to provide a narrative review on the molecular mechanisms involved in
   its neurotoxicity, with a special focus on the studies published in the
   last decade. The existing data demosntrate that although TiO2NP may
   cross blood-brain barrier and accumulate in brain, its neurotoxic
   effects may be mediated by systemic toxicity. In addition to neuronal
   damage and impaired neurogenesis, TiO2NP exposure also results in
   reduced neurite outgrowth and impaired neurotransmitter metabolism,
   especially dopamine and glutamate. TiO2NP exposure was also shown to
   promote alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid aggregation, thus increasing
   its toxicity. Recent findings also suggest that epigenetic effects and
   alterations in gut microbiota biodiversity contribute to TiO2NP
   neurotoxicity. Correspondingly, in vivo studies demosntrated that
   TiO2NPs induce a wide spectrum of adverse neurobehavioral effects, while
   epidemiological data are lacking. In addition, TiO2NPs were shown to
   promote neurotoxic effects of other toxic compounds. Here we show the
   contribution of a wide spectrum of molecular mechanisms to
   TiO2NP-induced neurotoxicity; yet, the role of TiO2NP exposure in
   adverse neurological outcomes in humans has yet to be fully appreciated.},

Abstract = {We demonstrated that the combination of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
   and a hybrid hydrogel based on chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol)/genipin
   (CS/PVA/GEN)-with ratios 7:3 (SIPNs1), 5:5 (SIPNs2), and 3:7 (SIPNs3)
   (w/w)-were useful for obtain-ing semi-interpenetrated polymeric networks
   (SIPNs). These SIPNs successfully combined the PDMS's elasticity, the
   PVA's swelling capability, and the excellent biological response of CS
   and GEN. Noticing these features are desirable in materials intended for
   biomedical applications such as wound healing and tissue engineering.
   Through evaluating the influence of PDMS and CS/PVA/GEN hybrid hydrogel
   ratios on the physico-chemical, mechanical, and the response of seeded
   cells, we found contact angles between 55? and 75?, while the swelling
   percentage was enhanced up to three times concerning blank PDMS.
   Besides, the elastic moduli presented values between 1 and 1.6 MPa. The
   fibroblasts seeded on the tested semi-interpenetrating polymeric
   networks were viable, and no cytotoxic effects were found. The cells
   presented fusiform shapes indicating an excellent attachment to the
   material's surface. The highest cell densities were found for SIPNs1 and
   SIPNs2, suggesting that these compositions in a membrane shape could
   potentially be used in wound healing/dressing or as a scaffold for
   tissue engineering.\{GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT\}},

Title = {Life histories of poeciliid fishes: searching for a size-dependent
   trade-off between number and size of offspring},
Journal = {ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A large body of knowledge about life-history traits has arisen from
   research on viviparous fishes of the family Poeciliidae. Still, the wide
   variation among species in reproductive strategies provides an excellent
   opportunity to further explore how life-history traits covary and the
   causes of covariation patterns. In this study, we provide information on
   brood size, offspring mass at birth, and total reproductive allotment of
   six poeciliid species (Gambusia sexradiata, Poeciliopsis latidens,
   Poeciliopsis viriosa, Priapella intermedia, Pseudoxiphophorus jonesii,
   and Xiphophorus hellerii). Also, we searched for a trade-off between the
   number of offspring that females produce and the size of each individual
   offspring. We tested the hypothesis that this trade-off should be
   stronger in small females because of the space constraints in the
   reproductive tract that are inherent to a small body size. If this
   hypothesis were correct, we expected a strong negative relationship
   between number and size of offspring in small females and a weaker or
   undetectable relationship between these two life-history traits in
   larger females. We found evidence of such a size-dependent trade-off in
   only one species. Small females of Po. latidens that produced relatively
   large broods experienced the cost of a reduction in the average size of
   each offspring. In larger females this negative relationship was weaker.
   Unexpectedly, we found no evidence of this trade-off in the other five
   poeciliid species and, in contrast, in one species (Priapella
   intermedia) females that produced numerous embryos were also capable of
   producing relatively large embryos. We discuss potential explanations
   for the different patterns of covariation (or lack of covariation)
   between number and size of offspring that we detected in these
   viviparous species.},

Abstract = {A top-down synthesis of graphene quantum dots (GQD) was carried out by
   hydrothermal method from different carbon sources (graphene,
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and black carbon) and H2O2 as an
   oxidizing agent, with an N source added in the reaction to modify the
   chemical surface of the GQD, giving rise to the nanomaterial N-GQD. The
   modified chemical surface of N-GQD partially allowed the nucleation and
   coupling of gold nanoparticles from a HAuCl4 solution. The X-ray
   diffraction spectrogram confirms the amorphization of the precursor
   materials, while the functionalized surface of N-GQD was characterized
   through UV-Vis, Fourier transform infrared, and photoluminescense
   spectrometry; TEM and FE-SEM show particle sizes between 8 and 15 nm.
   N-GQD@AuNP presence can be confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and TEM
   analysis, showing partial coupling and nanoparticle nucleation of Au in
   the structure with particle sizes between 20 and 40 nm.},

Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Several heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics of patients with
   myocardial ischemia are associated with a higher mortality risk.
   However, the immediate effect of acute ischemia on the HRV nonlinear
   dynamical behavior is unknown. The objective of this work is to explore
   the presence of nonlinearity through surrogate data testing and describe
   the dynamical behavior of HRV in acutely induced ischemia by
   percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with linear and
   recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Short-term
   electrocardiographic recordings from 68 patients before and after being
   treated with elective PTCA were selected from a publicly available
   database. The presence of nonlinear behavior was confirmed by
   determinism and laminarity in a relevant proportion of HRV time series,
   in up to 29.4\% during baseline conditions and 30.9\% after PTCA without
   statistical difference between these scenarios. After PTCA, the mean
   value and standard deviation of HRV time series decreased, while
   determinism and laminarity values increased. Here, the diminishment in
   overall variability caused by PTCA is not accompanied by a change in
   nonlinearity detection. Therefore, the presence of nonlinear behavior in
   HRV time series is not necessarily in agreement with the change of
   traditional and RQA measures.},

Abstract = {Kynureninase (KYNU) is a kynurenine pathway (KP) enzyme that produces
   metabolites with immunomodulatory properties. In recent years,
   overactivation of KP has been associated with poor prognosis of several
   types of cancer, in particular by promoting the invasion, metastasis,
   and chemoresistance of cancer cells. However, the role of KYNU in
   gliomas remains to be explored. In this study, we used the available
   data from TCGA, CGGA and GTEx projects to analyze KYNU expression in
   gliomas and healthy tissue, as well as the potential contribution of
   KYNU in the tumor immune infiltrate. In addition, immune-related genes
   were screened with KYNU expression. KYNU expression correlated with the
   increased malignancy of astrocytic tumors. Survival analysis in primary
   astrocytomas showed that KYNU expression correlated with poor prognosis.
   Additionally, KYNU expression correlated positively with several genes
   related to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and with the
   characteristic immune tumor infiltrate. These findings indicate that
   KYNU could be a potential therapeutic target for modulating the tumor
   microenvironment and enhancing an effective antitumor immune response.},

Abstract = {The historical relationships of nine areas of endemism of the tropical
   montane cloud forests (TMCFs) were analysed based on a temporal
   cladistic biogeographical approach. Three cladistic biogeographical
   analyses were conducted based on 29 cladograms of terrestrial taxa by
   partitioning them into three time-slices, namely, Miocene, Pliocene, and
   Pleistocene. The results showed different area relationships over time.
   For the Miocene and Pliocene time slices, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
   acted as a geographic barrier that fragmented the TMCFs into two
   portions: west of the Isthmus and east of the Isthmus. In the case of
   the Pleistocene, the TMCFs were broken into two portions, one related to
   the Neotropical region and the other to the Nearctic region.
   Furthermore, the analyses allowed us to detect the influences of
   different geological and paleoclimatological events on the distribution
   of the TMCFs over time. Therefore, the TMCFs current distribution might
   have been driven by geological events during the Miocene-Pliocene,
   whereas climatic fluctuations have the highest impact during the
   Pleistocene.},

Title = {Baroreflex Sensitivity Assessment Using the Sequence Method with Delayed
   Signals in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Impaired baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is partially responsible for
   erratic blood pressure fluctuations in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
   patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD), which is related to autonomic
   nervous dysfunction. The sequence method with delayed signals allows for
   the measurement of BRS in a non-invasive fashion and the investigation
   of alterations in this physiological feedback system that maintains BP
   within healthy limits. Our objective was to evaluate the modified
   delayed signals in the sequence method for BRS assessment in ESRD
   patients without pharmacological antihypertensive treatment and compare
   them with those of healthy subjects. We recruited 22 healthy volunteers
   and 18 patients with ESRD. We recorded continuous BP to obtain a 15-min
   time series of systolic blood pressure and interbeat intervals during
   the supine position (SP) and active standing (AS) position. The time
   series with delays from 0 to 5 heartbeats were used to calculate the
   BRS, number of data points, number of sequences, and estimation error.
   The BRS from the ESRD patients was smaller than in healthy subjects (p <
   0.05). The BRS estimation with the delayed sequences also increased the
   number of data points and sequences and decreased the estimation error
   compared to the original time series. The modified sequence method with
   delayed signals may be useful for the measurement of baroreflex
   sensitivity in ESRD patients with a shorter recording time and
   maintaining an estimation error below 0.01 in both the supine and active
   standing positions. With this framework, it was corroborated that
   baroreflex sensitivity in ESRD is decreased when compared with healthy
   subjects.},

Abstract = {Introduction More than sixteen countries are infected with the highly
   pathogenic avian influenza A-H5N1 virus. As the virus circles the world,
   it has led to the slaughter of millions of poultry birds as well as the
   infection of farmed mink in Europe and among seals and grizzly bears on
   the Northern coast of America; some infected mammals exhibited
   neurological symptoms like disorientation and blindness, which marks the
   first large H5N1 outbreak potentially driven by mammal-to-mammal
   transmission that could be poised to spillover into humans its mortality
   rate in humans exceeds 50\%. The virus pandemic potential is
   continuously monitored to characterize further and analyze its zoonotic
   potential (PAHO/WHO, March 2023).Objective To gain comprehension of the
   envelope glycoproteins that express H5N1 influenza (hemagglutinin and
   neuraminidase proteins), computational studies were carried out.Methods
   Calculating each sequence's Protein Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition
   (PIDP) and Polarity Index Method Profile 2.0 v (PIM 2.0 v) required the
   employment of multiple computer algorithms.Results The analysis of the
   PIM 2.0 v and PIDP profiles revealed specific patterns within the
   envelope glycoproteins (neuraminidase and hemagglutinin) of diverse
   strains of the H5N1 influenza virus. These patterns made it possible to
   identify structural and morphological similarities.Conclusion Using the
   PIM 2.0 v profile, our computational programs were able to identify the
   influenza H5N1 virus envelope glycoproteins (hemagglutinin and
   neuraminidase strains). This study contributes to a better comprehension
   of this emerging virus.},

Abstract = {Background From the existing knowledge of viruses, those infecting
   plants and bacteria and affecting animals are particularly interesting.
   This is because such viruses have an ability to vertically transmit to
   other species, including humans, and therefore could represent a public
   health issue of significant proportions. Objective This study aims to
   bioinformatically characterize the proteins from the DNA and RNA viruses
   capable of infecting plants and bacteria, and affecting animals, of
   which there is some evidence of contact with human beings. It follows up
   on our previous study ``Characterization of Proteins from Putative Human
   DNA and RNA Viruses{''}. Methods The Polarity Index Method profile
   (PIM), Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition (IDPD) profiles, and a Markov
   chains analysis of three DNA-viruses protein sequences and four
   RNA-viruses protein sequences that infect plants and bacteria and affect
   animals, extracted from the UniProt database, were calculated using a
   set of in-house computational programs. Results Computational runs
   carried out in this work reveal relevant regularities at the level of
   the viral proteins' charge/polarity and IDPD profiles. These results
   enable the re-creation of the taxonomy known for the DNA- and RNA-virus
   protein sequences. In addition, an analysis of the entire set of
   proteins qualified as ``reviewed{''} in the UniProt database was carried
   out for each protein viral group to discover proteins with similar PIM
   profiles. A significant number of proteins with such charge/polarity
   profiles were found. Conclusion The bioinformatics results obtained at
   the level of the amino acid sequences, generated important information
   that contributes to the understanding of these protein groups.},

   is commonly associated with a strong predisposition for sudden cardiac
   death. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias could occur secondary to the
   dysfunction of the cardiac sodium voltage-gated Na(v)1.5 channel
   (SCN5A). Objective This study aimed to perform a multiparametric
   computational analysis of the physicochemical properties of SCN5A
   mutants associated with BrS using a set of bioinformatics tools. Methods
   In-house algorithms were calibrated to calculate, in a double-blind
   test, the Polarity Index Method (PIM) profile and protein intrinsic
   disorder predisposition (PIDP) profile of each sequence, and computer
   programs specialized in the genomic analysis were used. Results Specific
   regularities in the charge/polarity and PIDP profile of the SCN5A mutant
   proteins enabled the re-creation of the taxonomy, allowing us to propose
   a bioinformatics method that takes advantage of the PIM profile to
   identify this group of proteins from their sequence. Conclusion
   Bioinformatics programs could reproduce characteristic PIM and PIDP
   profiles of the BrS-related SCN5A mutant proteins. This information can
   contribute to a better understanding of these altered proteins.},

Abstract = {Indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO), a rate limiting enzyme of the tryptophan
   catabolism through the kynurenine pathway (KP), has been related with a
   lower survival and a poor patient prognosis on several solid tumors,
   including gliomas. However, the use of IDO inhibitors as a therapeutic
   strategy for tumor treatment remains controversial in clinical trials
   and the role of other KP enzymes on tumor progression has remained
   poorly understood so far. Recently, different studies on different types
   of cancer have pointed out the importance of KP enzymes downstream IDO.
   Because of this, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of the expression
   of different KP enzymes and their correlation with the gene expression
   of molecules related to the hallmarks of cancer in transcriptomic
   datasets from patients with different types of brain tumors including
   low grade gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, and
   paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. We found that KP enzymes that drive
   to NAD+ synthesis are overexpressed on different brain tumors compared
   to brain cortex data. Moreover, these enzymes presented positive
   correlations with the expression of genes related to immune response
   modulation, angiogenesis, Signal Transducer and Activator of
   Transcription (STAT) signaling, and Rho GTPase expression. These
   correlations suggest the relevance of the expression of the KP enzymes
   in brain tumor pathogenesis.},

Title = {Is Mexico?s population hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines? A 2021 survey
   on different levels of hesitancy and its determinants},
Journal = {SSM-POPULATION HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy is a well-known phenomenon whereby individuals in a
   population reject or delay being vaccinated despite having access to
   vaccine services. This phenomenon is especially problematic in the
   current context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV2) pandemic because vaccine hesitancy can decrease vaccination
   rates. In Mexico, vaccine hesitancy has been less thoroughly studied
   than in other countries such as the United States despite its importance
   and the potential impact of overlooking the problem. Understanding and
   effectively tackling this problem requires a more in-depth analysis of
   the defining characteristics of vaccination hesitancy. For this purpose,
   the World Health Organization's (WHO) Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants
   Matrix (VHDM in this study) is highly useful. In the present study, a
   digital survey was conducted using Google Forms to assess the level of
   vaccine hesitancy in the Mexican population and the vaccine determinants
   of the VHDM model associated with the respondents' different levels of
   vaccine hesitancy. The sample consisted of 1,195 people divided into
   four levels of vaccine hesitancy based on their answers. Tests for
   association were performed, identifying an association between some
   determinants of the VHDM model and the levels of vaccine hesitancy.
   Based on the analysis of the survey results, areas of opportunity for
   addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Mexico were found and
   discussed; these included the importance of studying vaccine hesitancy
   as a complex and changing gradient, the high connectivity of people with
   high level of vaccine hesitancy to networks of people with vaccine
   hesitancy, the relatively high trust in physicians at all levels of
   vaccine hesitancy, the low trust in government authorities at high and
   moderate levels of vaccine hesitancy, and the strong association of the
   fear of suffering side effects and knowing people who have suffered them
   with the level of vaccine hesitancy.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzed the growth and multidisciplinary nature of
   Artificial Intelligence research during the last 60 years. Web of
   Science coverage since 1960 was considered, and a descriptive research
   was performed. A top-down approach using Web of Science subject
   categories as a proxy to measure multidisciplinarity was developed.
   Bibliometric indicators based on the core of subject categories
   involving articles and citing articles related to this area were
   applied. The data analysis within a historical and epistemological
   perspective allowed to identify three main evolutionary stages: an
   emergence period (1960-1979), based on foundational literature from
   1950s; a re-emergence and consolidation period (1980-2009), involving a
   ``paradigmatic{''} phase of development and first industrial approach;
   and a period of re-configuration of the discipline as a technoscience
   (2010-2019), where an explosion of solutions for productive systems,
   wide collaboration networks and multidisciplinary research projects were
   observed. The multidisciplinary dynamics of the field was analyzed using
   a Thematic Dispersion Index. This indicator clearly described the
   transition from the consolidation stage to the re-configuration of the
   field, finding application in a wide diversity of scientific and
   technological domains. The results demonstrated that epistemic changes
   and qualitative leaps in Artificial Intelligence research have been
   associated to variations in multidisciplinarity patterns.},

Abstract = {Z-bixin is the main metabolite contained in Achiote, which is widely
   used as a food condiment and pigment. Z-bixin plays an important role in
   photosynthesis. It is used to develop artificial solar cells and
   scavenge radical oxygen and nitrogen species. In this work, the
   photochemistry of Z-bixin with solar irradiation and lamps at 365 and
   410 nm was determined in solution. The ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy
   (UV-Vis) and Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC)
   analysis showed that elaidinization of Z-bixin to E-bixin can be reached
   under radiation. This is in accordance with the computational evaluation
   that indicates that the mechanism consists of three bond rotations with
   an energy requirement of 5.43 and 5.23 kcal/mol for the first and second
   steps and no energy barriers to the last step. After elaidinization,
   total degradation was observed through a cascade reaction that generated
   CO, CO2, H2CO, and HCl.},

Abstract = {Due to the complexity imposed by all the attributes of the fracture
   network of many naturally fractured reservoirs, it has been observed
   that fluid flow does not necessarily represent a normal diffusion, i.e.,
   Darcy's law. Thus, to capture the sub-diffusion process, various tools
   have been implemented, from fractal geometry to characterize the
   structure of the porous medium to fractional calculus to include the
   memory effect in the fluid flow. Considering infinite naturally
   fractured reservoirs (Type I system of Nelson), a spatial fractional
   Darcy's law is proposed, where the spatial derivative is replaced by the
   Weyl fractional derivative, and the resulting flow model also considers
   Caputo's fractional derivative in time. The proposed model maintains its
   dimensional balance and is solved numerically. The results of analyzing
   the effect of the spatial fractional Darcy's law on the pressure drop
   and its Bourdet derivative are shown, proving that two definitions of
   fractional derivatives are compatible. Finally, the results of the
   proposed model are compared with models that consider fractal geometry
   showing a good agreement. It is shown that modified Darcy's law, which
   considers the dependency of the fluid flow path, includes the intrinsic
   geometry of the porous medium, thus recovering the heterogeneity at the
   phenomenological level.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic Border Irrigation Model: Comparison of Infiltration
   Equations},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The variation in moisture content between subsequent irrigations
   determines the use of infiltration equations that contain representative
   physical parameters of the soil when irrigation begins. This study
   analyzes the reliability of the hydrodynamic model to simulate the
   advanced phase in border irrigation. For the solution of the
   hydrodynamic model, a Lagrangian scheme in implicit finite differences
   is used, while for infiltration, the Kostiakov equation and the Green
   and Ampt equation are used and compared. The latter was solved using the
   Newton-Raphson method due to its implicit nature. The models were
   validated, and unknown parameters were optimized using experimental data
   available in the literature and the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The
   results show that it is necessary to use infiltration equations based on
   soil parameters, because in subsequent irrigations, the initial
   conditions change, modifying the advance curve in border irrigation.
   From the coupling of both equations, it is shown that the empirical
   Kostiakov equation is only representative for a specific irrigation
   event, while with the Green and Ampt equations, the subsequent
   irrigations can be modeled, and the advance/infiltration process can be
   observed in detail.},

Title = {Characterization of Redox Environment and Tryptophan Catabolism through
   Kynurenine Pathway in Military Divers' and Swimmers' Serum Samples},
Journal = {ANTIOXIDANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Endurance and resistance exercises, alone or in combination, induce
   metabolic changes that affect tryptophan (Trp) catabolism. The
   kynurenine pathway (KP) is the main route of Trp degradation, and it is
   modulated by the inflammatory and redox environments. Previous studies
   have shown that KP metabolites work as myokines that mediate the
   positive systemic effects related to exercise. However, it is poorly
   understood how different exercise modalities and intensities impact the
   KP. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of two
   different exercise modalities, military diving and swimming, on the KP
   and the redox environment. A total of 34 healthy men from the Mexican
   Navy were included in the study, 20 divers and 14 swimmers, who started
   and stayed in military training consistently during the six months of
   the study; 12 Mexican men without fitness training were used as the
   control group. Physical fitness was determined at the beginning and
   after 6 months of training; criteria included body composition; serum
   levels of Trp, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA) and
   3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK); the glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG); and
   malondialdehyde (MDA).. Results showed a significant loss of body fat in
   both the diver and swimmer groups. Compared with the control group,
   divers showed a decrease in Trp and 3-HK levels, but no changes were
   observed in the KYN/Trp, KYNA/Trp or 3-HK/Trp ratios, while swimmers
   showed a decrease in KYN levels and an increase in the KYNA and 3-HK
   levels. Additionally, divers showed a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio and
   an increase in MDA levels, in contrast to the swimmers, who showed a
   decrease in MDA levels and an increase in GSH/GSSG levels. Our findings
   suggest a differential shift in the KP and redox environment induced by
   diving and swimming. Swimming promotes an antioxidant environment and a
   peripheral overactivation of the KP.},

Abstract = {Background: : The global outbreak of the 2019 novel Coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) caused by infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory
   Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which appeared in China at the end
   of 2019, signifies a major public health issue at the current time.
   Objective: The objective of the present study is to characterize the
   physicochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins at a residues
   level, and to generate a ``bioinformatics fingerprint{''} in the form of
   a ``PIM profile{''} created for each sequence utilizing the Polarity
   Index Method (PIM), suit-able for the identification of these proteins.
   Methods: Two different bioinformatics approaches were used to analyze
   sequence characteristics of these proteins at the residues level, an
   in-house bioinformatics system PIM, and a set of the com-monly used
   algorithms for the prediction of protein intrinsic disorder
   predisposition, such as PON-DR VLXT, PONDR VL3, PONDR VSL2, PONDR FIT,
   IUPred \_short and IUPred\_long. The PIM profile was generated for four
   SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and compared with the correspond-ing
   profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins, SARS-CoV-2 putative
   proteins, SARS--CoV proteins, MERS-CoV proteins, sets of bacterial,
   fungal, and viral proteins, cell-penetrating peptides, and a set of
   intrinsically disordered proteins. We also searched for the UniProt
   proteins with PIM profiles similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 structural,
   non-structural, and putative proteins. Results: We show that SARS-CoV-2
   structural, non-structural, and putative proteins are character-ized by
   a unique PIM profile. A total of 1736 proteins were identified from the
   562 ,253 ``reviewed{''} proteins from the UniProt database, whose PIM
   profile was similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 structural,
   non-structural, and putative proteins. Conclusion: The PIM profile
   represents an important characteristic that might be useful for the
   identification of similar to SARS-CoV-2 protiens},

Abstract = {Background: In the vast variety of viruses known, there is a particular
   interest in those transmitted to humans and whose ability to disseminate
   represents a significant public health issue. Objective: The present
   study's objective is to bioinformatically characterize the proteins of
   the two main divisions of viruses, RNA-viruses and DNA-viruses. Methods:
   In this work, a set of in-house computational programs was used to
   calculate the polarity/charge profiles and intrinsic disorder
   predisposition profiles of the proteins of several groups of viruses
   representing both types extracted from the UniProt database. The
   efficiency of these computational programs was statistically verified.
   Results: It was found that the polarity/charge profile of the proteins
   is, in most cases, an efficient discriminant that allows the re-creation
   of the taxonomy known for both viral groups. Additionally, the entire
   set of ``reviewed{''} proteins in the UniProt database was analyzed to
   find proteins with polarity/charge profiles similar to those obtained
   for each viral group. This search revealed a substantial number of
   proteins with such polarity-charge profiles. Conclusion: Polarity/charge
   profile represents a physicochemical metric, which is easy to calculate,
   and which can be used to effectively identify viral groups from their
   protein sequences.},

Title = {On the Antioxidant Properties of L-Kynurenine: An Efficient ROS
   Scavenger and Enhancer of Rat Brain Antioxidant Defense},

Abstract = {L-kynurenine (L-KYN) is an endogenous metabolite, that has been used as
   a neuroprotective strategy in experimental models. The protective
   effects of L-KYN have been attributed mainly to kynurenic acid (KYNA).
   However, considering that L-KYN is prone to oxidation, this redox
   property may play a substantial role in its protective effects. The aim
   of this work was to characterize the potential impact of the redox
   properties of L-KYN, in both synthetic and biological systems. First, we
   determined whether L-KYN scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
   prevents DNA and protein oxidative degradation in synthetic systems. The
   effect of L-KYN and KYNA (0.1-100 mu M) on redox markers (ROS
   production, lipoperoxidation and cellular function) was compared in rat
   brain homogenates when exposed to FeSO4 (10 mu M). Then, the effect of
   L-KYN administration (75 mg/kg/day for 5 days) on the GSH content and
   the enzymatic activity of glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione
   peroxidase (GPx) was determined in rat brain tissue. Finally, brain
   homogenates from rats pretreated with L-KYN were exposed to pro-oxidants
   and oxidative markers were evaluated. The results show that L-KYN is an
   efficient scavenger of (OH)-O-? and ONOO-, but not O-2(?-) or H2O2 and
   that it prevents DNA and protein oxidative degradation in synthetic
   systems. L-KYN diminishes the oxidative effect induced by FeSO4 on brain
   homogenates at lower concentrations (1 mu M) when compared to KYNA (100
   mu M). Furthermore, the sub-chronic administration of L-KYN increased
   the GSH content and the activity of both GR and GPx, and also prevented
   the oxidative damage induced by the ex vivo exposure to pro-oxidants.
   Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that L-KYN can be considered
   as a potential endogenous antioxidant.},

Title = {Sets of Fractional Operators and Numerical Estimation of the Order of
   Convergence of a Family of Fractional Fixed-Point Methods},
Journal = {FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Considering the large number of fractional operators that exist, and
   since it does not seem that their number will stop increasing soon at
   the time of writing this paper, it is presented for the first time, as
   far as the authors know, a simple and compact method to work the
   fractional calculus through the classification of fractional operators
   using sets. This new method of working with fractional operators, which
   may be called fractional calculus of sets, allows generalizing objects
   of conventional calculus, such as tensor operators, the Taylor series of
   a vector-valued function, and the fixed-point method, in several
   variables, which allows generating the method known as the fractional
   fixed-point method. Furthermore, it is also shown that each fractional
   fixed-point method that generates a convergent sequence has the ability
   to generate an uncountable family of fractional fixed-point methods that
   generate convergent sequences. So, it is presented a method to estimate
   numerically in a region omega the mean order of convergence of any
   fractional fixed-point method, and it is shown how to construct a hybrid
   fractional iterative method to determine the critical points of a scalar
   function. Finally, considering that the proposed method to classify
   fractional operators through sets allows generalizing the existing
   results of the fractional calculus, some examples are shown of how to
   define families of fractional operators that satisfy some property to
   ensure the validity of the results to be generalized.},

Abstract = {Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition that impairs patients'
   quality of life and life expectancy. The development of noninvasive
   instruments may help elucidate the prognosis of this cardiorespiratory
   disease. We aimed to evaluate the utility of routinely performed
   noninvasive test results as prognostic markers in patients with
   pulmonary hypertension. We enrolled 198 patients with mean pulmonary
   artery pressure >25 mmHg measured at cardiac catheterisation or
   echocardiographic pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 40 mmHg and
   tricuspid regurgitation Vmax >2.9 m/s, and clinical information
   regarding management and follow-up studies from the date of diagnosis.
   Multivariate analysis revealed that female sex {[}HR: 0.21, (95\% CI:
   0.07-0.64); p = 0.006], the presence of collagenopathies {[}HR: 8.63,
   (95\% CI: 2.38-31.32); p = 0.001], an increased red blood cell
   distribution width {[}HR: 1.25, (95\% CI: 1.04-1.49); p = 0.017] and an
   increased electrocardiographic P axis (P degrees)/T axis (T degrees)
   ratio {[}HR: 0.93, (95\% CI: 0.88-0.98); p = 0.009] were
   severity-associated factors, while older age {[}HR: 1.57, (95\% CI:

Abstract = {We formulate a system of ordinary differential equations to model the
   contribution of antibiotic treatment and immune system to combat

   when the bacteria can be eliminated, which are consistent with

   formulated an optimal control problem considering the action of both
   antibiotic and immune system. The optimal control is obtained applying
   the Pontryagin's Principle. The results show the relevance of the
   synergism between the antibiotic treatment and the immune system

Abstract = {In the following paper, we present a way to accelerate the speed of
   convergence of the fractional Newton-Raphson (F N-R) method, which seems
   to have an order of convergence at least linearly for the case in which
   the order alpha of the derivative is different from one. A simplified
   way of constructing the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional operators,
   fractional integral and fractional derivative is presented along with
   examples of its application on different functions. Furthermore, an
   introduction to Aitken's method is made and it is explained why it has
   the ability to accelerate the convergence of the iterative methods, in
   order to finally present the results that were obtained when
   implementing Aitken's method in the F N-R method, where it is shown that
   F N-R with Aitken's method converges faster than the simple F N-R.},

Journal = {PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {526-536},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Among the implemented strategies for recycling and reutilization of
   HDPE, pyrolysis process is considered an attractive alternative, because
   its potential to use waste materials to produce valuable chemical
   feedstock and high energy content hydrocarbons. Through pyrolysis
   transformation, plastics are thermally cracked in the absence of oxygen
   and the reaction parameters can be controlled to favor the production of
   specific compounds and liquid fractions. During this project, waste HDPE
   thermal decomposition was evaluated in a range of 450-550 degrees C,
   considering samples of 2 mm and 5 mm and a residence time of 30 min. A
   design of experiments was applied to find the optimal conditions to
   maximize the volatile fraction. Then the waste HDPE was transformed in a
   two-step pyrolysis in order to maximize the volatiles fraction and the
   intermediate and final products analyzed. According to results, A
   volatile fraction equivalent to the 97 \% of HDPE mass was obtained at
   500 degrees C, with a 5 mm particle size and a hold time of 30 min. The
   chemical analysis of wax and oil products showed that, although both
   blends are similarly made of alkanes, alkenes, and dienes, the compounds
   found in oil are shorter-chain and in a greater variety than those found
   in wax.

Title = {Bioinformatics-based Identification of Proteins Expressed by
   Arthropod-borne Viruses Transmitted by Aedes Aegypti Mosquito},
Journal = {CURRENT PROTEOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-94},
Abstract = {Background: The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is a vector of several
   arthropod-borne viruses, such as Mayaro, Dengue, Chikungunya, Yellow
   Fever, and Zika. These viruses cause the death of at least 600000 people
   a year and temporarily disable several million more around the world. Up
   to date, there are no effective prophylactic measures that would prevent
   the contact and bite of this arthropod and, therefore, its consequential
   contagion.
   Objective: The objective of the present study was to search for the
   regularities of the proteins expressed by these five viruses, at
   residues level, and obtain a ``bioinformatic fingerprint{''} to select
   them.
   Methods: We used two bioinformatic systems, our in-house bioinformatic
   system named Polarity Index Method (R) (PIM (R)) supported at residues
   level, and the commonly used algorithm for the prediction of intrinsic
   disorder predisposition, PONDR (R) FIT. We applied both programs to the
   29 proteins that express the five groups of arboviruses studied, and we
   calculated for each of them their Polarity Index Method (R) profile and
   their intrinsic disorder predisposition. This information was then
   compared with analogous information for other protein groups, such as
   proteins from bacteria, fungi, viruses, and cell-penetrating peptides
   from the UniProt database, and a set of intrinsically disordered
   proteins. Once the ``fingerprint{''} of each group of arboviruses was
   obtained, these ``fingerprints{''} were searched among the 559228
   ``reviewed{''} proteins from the UniProt database.
   Results: In total, 1736 proteins were identified from the 559228
   ``reviewed{''} proteins from the UniProt database, with similar ``PIM
   (R) profile{''} to the 29 mutated proteins that express the five groups
   of arboviruses.
   Conclusion: We propose that the ``PIM (R) profile{''} of
   characterization of proteins might be useful for the identification of
   proteins expressed by arthropod-borne viruses transmitted by Aedes
   aegypti mosquito.},

Title = {Bioinformatics-Based Identification of Selective Cationic Amphipatic
   Antibacterial Peptides: Aurein 1.2 Variants Case},
Journal = {CURRENT PROTEOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {505-518},
Abstract = {Background: Selective Cationic Amphipathic Antibacterial Peptides
   (SCAAPs) occupy a prominent place in the production of new drugs on
   account of their high toxicity towards bacteria and low toxicity towards
   mammalian cells, low hemolytic activity, and contribution to the
   protection of the human immune system.
   Introduction: their number in nature is very low, and experimental tests
   are very protracted and costly. Therefore, it would be useful to have
   bioinformatics tools that would identify them in the existing databases
   and also propose new synthetic SCAAPs.
   Methods: In order to reduce the costs of identification and/or chemical
   synthesis and to know the physicochemical characteristics of SCAAPs at a
   residues level and to obtain a ``bioiformatics fingerprint{''} suitable
   for their selection , we have modified the Polarity Index Method (R)
   (PIM (R)) and the alpha-helical configuration of each sequence is
   included in determining their individual ``PIM (R) profile{''}. We have
   also used a set of the computer program to determine their ``Intrinsic
   Disorder Predisposition{''}. This information was then compared with
   other protein groups , such as bacteria, fungi, virus and
   cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) from the UniProt database and a set of
   intrinsically disordered proteins. Once the ``fingerprint{''} of SCAAPs
   was obtained , it was used for searching among the 559228 ``reviewed{''}
   proteins from the UniProt database and a set of synthetic SCAAPs
   characterized by the predefined ``PIM (R) profile{''} selected.
   Results: Our results showed that the metric named ``PIM (R) profile{''}
   can identify, with a high level of accuracy , a group of bacterial
   SCAAPs. This bioinformatics study was supported at residues level ,
   using the in-house bioinformatics system Polarity Index Method, the
   commonly used algorithm for predicting intrinsic disorder
   predisposition, PONDR (R) FIT.
   Conclusions: The Polarity Index Method seems highly efficient in
   identifying SCAAP candidates.},

Title = {The notion of variable quantities ω in Bolzano's early works},
Journal = {HISTORIA MATHEMATICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {25-49},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Amid the debate over infinitesimals, Bolzano introduced the alternative
   notion of variable quantities omega in his 1816 work on the binomial
   theorem. It has often been assumed that his 1817 definition of
   continuity using them is practically the modern one. This paper explores
   Bolzano's early mathematical works and diaries to gain insight into the
   subtleties in his definition of w and some of his mathematical
   procedures. We show that those quantities are not clearly
   `proto-Weierstrassian' and argue that Bolzano was in the process of
   refinement and increasing abstraction of the idea of quantity that
   eventually led to the development of a theory of real numbers. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Linear heart rate variability (HRV) indices are dependent on the mean
   heart rate, which has been demonstrated in different models (from
   sinoatrial cells to humans). The association between nonlinear HRV
   indices, including those provided by recurrence plot quantitative
   analysis (RQA), and the mean heart rate (or the mean cardiac period,
   also called meanNN) has been scarcely studied. For this purpose, we
   analyzed RQA indices of five minute-long HRV time series obtained in the
   supine position and during active standing from 30 healthy subjects and
   29 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (before and after
   hemodialysis). In the supine position, ESRD patients showed shorter
   meanNN (i.e., faster heart rate) and decreased variability compared to
   healthy subjects. The healthy subjects responded to active standing by
   shortening the meanNN and decreasing HRV indices to reach similar values
   of ESRD patients. Bivariate correlations between all RQA indices and
   meanNN were significant in healthy subjects and ESRD after hemodialysis
   and for most RQA indices in ESRD patients before hemodialysis. Multiple
   linear regression analyses showed that RQA indices were also dependent
   on the position and the ESRD condition. Then, future studies should
   consider the association among RQA indices, meanNN, and these other
   factors for a correct interpretation of HRV.},

Abstract = {An adjacent vertex distinguishing total k-coloring f of a graph G is a
   proper total k coloring of G such that no pair of adjacent vertices has
   the same color sets, where the color set at a vertex v, CfG(v), is \{f

   coronas, in particular for generalized, simple and l-coronas of graphs,

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the potential use of
   discriminant analysis for discrete variables whose dependence structure
   is assumed to follow, or can be approximated by, a tree-structured
   graphical model. This is done by comparing its empirical performance,
   using estimated error rates for real and simulated data, with the
   well-known Naive Bayes classification rule and with linear logistic
   regression, both of which do not consider any interaction between
   variables, and with models that consider interactions like a
   decomposable and the saturated model. The results show that discriminant
   analysis based on tree-structured graphical models, a simple nonlinear
   method including only some of the pairwise interactions between
   variables, is competitive with, and sometimes superior to, other methods
   which assume no interactions, and has the advantage over more complex
   decomposable models of finding the graph structure in a fast way and
   exact form.},

Abstract = {Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja) feather samples were collected from
   nestlings in breeding colonies in the Birama Swamp (n = 34 individuals)
   and Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago (n = 38 individuals) of Cuba. Genetic
   diversity and structure were determined from nestling feather samples
   using five microsatellite loci, and sibling relationships and mating
   system were inferred. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to
   eight, with an average of 5.6 alleles per locus and a total of 28
   alleles, and no genetic structure was found between the Cuban colonies.
   Sibship determined from 52 dyads (nestling-pairs) showed deviation from
   genetic monogamy, with seven of 24 nests presenting evidence of
   extra-pair paternity (EPP) and five nests presenting evidence of
   conspecific brood parasitism (CBP). Genetic diversity was similar to
   that reported for colonies from the United States and Brazil, and EPP
   was more frequent than CBP as an alternative to monogamy.},

Abstract = {Feedback is a key element of regulation, as it shapes the sensitivity of
   a process to its environment. Positive feedback upregulates, and
   negative feedback downregulates. Many regulatory processes involve a
   mixture of both, whether in nature or in engineering. This article
   revisits the mixed-feedback paradigm, with the aim of investigating
   control across scales. We propose that mixed feedback regulates
   excitability and that excitability plays a central role in multiscale
   neuronal signaling. We analyze this role in a multiscale network
   architecture inspired by neurophysiology. The nodal behavior defines a
   mesoscale that connects actuation at the microscale to regulation at the
   macroscale. We show that mixed-feedback nodal control provides
   regulatory principles at the network scale, with a nodal resolution. In
   this sense, the mixed-feedback paradigm is a control principle across
   scales.},

Abstract = {In the 80's Aschbacher classified the maximal subgroups of almost all of
   the finite almost simple classical groups. Essentially, this
   classification divide these subgroups into two types. The first of these
   consist roughly of subgroups that preserve some kind of geometric
   structure, so they are commonly called subgroups of geometric type. In
   this paper we will prove the existence of infinitely many compatible
   systems \{rho l\}(l) f of n-dimensional Galois representations
   associated to regular algebraic, essentially self-dual, cuspidal
   automorphic representations of GL(n)(A(Q)) (n even) such that, for
   almost all primes l, the image of (rho) over barl (the
   semi-simplification of the reduction of rho l) cannot be contained in a
   maximal subgroup of geometric type of an n-dimensional symplectic or
   orthogonal group. Then, we apply this result to some 12-dimensional
   representations to give heuristic evidence towards the inverse Galois
   problem for even-dimensional orthogonal groups.},

Abstract = {The expansion of human settlements and primary-sector activities
   (agriculture and forestry) has resulted in the fragmentation of forests,
   but the impacts of this are still poorly understood. We examined the
   effect of patch size on the presence of plant functional groups along an
   edge-interior gradient. Plant species were classified based on a two-way
   indicator species analysis in order to determine their establishment
   thresholds and vulnerability along the gradient, while detrended
   correspondence analyses and canonical correspondence analyses were
   performed to identify environmental gradients related to vegetation
   distribution. Two groups of plant species were recognized in all patch
   sizes: one commonly found towards the edge and the other in the interior
   zone. The incidence of these groups was correlated with environmental
   factors associated with the edge-interior gradient, mainly with
   humidity, soil moisture and light (canopy opening and global site
   factor) in the edge zone and with litter cover, depth of litter, slope
   and soil and air temperature in the interior zone. Identifying the
   species' threshold responses to fragmentation is key, as they provide
   tools to prevent the potential local extinction of species.},

Abstract = {The number of fatalities and economic losses caused by the Ebola virus
   infection across the planet culminated in the havoc that occurred
   between August and November 2014. However, little is known about the
   molecular protein profile of this devastating virus. This work
   represents a thorough bioinformatics analysis of the regularities of
   charge distribution (polar profiles) in two groups of proteins and their
   functional domains associated with Ebola virus disease: Ebola virus
   proteins and Human proteins interacting with Ebola virus. Our analysis
   reveals that a fragment exists in each of these proteins-one named the
   ``functional domain{''}-with the polar profile similar to the polar
   profile of the protein that contains it. Each protein is formed by a
   group of short sub-sequences, where each fragment has a different and
   distinctive polar profile and where the polar profile between adjacent
   short sub-sequences changes orderly and gradually to coincide with the
   polar profile of the whole protein. When using the charge distribution
   as a metric, it was observed that it effectively discriminates the
   proteins from their functional domains. As a counterexample, the same
   test was applied to a set of synthetic proteins built for that purpose,
   revealing that any of the regularities reported here for the Ebola virus
   proteins and human proteins interacting with Ebola virus were not
   present in the synthetic proteins. Our results indicate that the polar
   profile of each protein studied and its corresponding functional domain
   are similar. Thus, when building each protein from its functional
   domai-adding one amino acid at a time and plotting each time its polar
   profile-it was observed that the resulting graphs can be divided into
   groups with similar polar profiles.},

Abstract = {The protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia has traditionally been reported
   as lacking peroxisomes, organelles involved in fatty acid metabolism and
   detoxification of reactive oxygen species. We here report the finding
   with transmission electron microscopy of an oxidase activity in
   cytoplasmic vesicles of trophozoites and cysts of G. lamblia. These
   vesicles were positive to 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and to cerium chloride
   staining. In addition, using bioinformatic tools, two peroxisomal
   proteins were identified in the G. lamblia proteome: acyl-CoA synthetase
   long chain family member 4 (ACSL-4) and peroxin-4 (PEX-4). With confocal
   and immunoelectron microscopy using polyclonal antibodies both proteins
   were identified in cytoplasmic vesicles of trophozoites. Altogether, our
   results suggest for the first time the presence of peroxisomal-like
   proteins in the cytoplasm of G. lamblia.},

Abstract = {The opto-fluidics systems can be used for label free refractometric and
   biosensensing applications. In this work transmission properties of
   one-dimensional polycarbonate-liquid photonic arrays are studied, where
   methanol and ethanol were proposed as liquid components. The band
   structure and the transmission spectrum were calculated using the
   transference matrix method, in which we consider the dispersion relation
   for the refractive index n(w) of each material in the visible range.
   Using lattice parameters of 1 mu m, 10 mu m, and 4 mu m, we obtained
   forbidden bandgaps in the visible region. When lattice parameters of
   1000 mu m were considered, we obtained several narrow bandgaps in the
   visible range.},

Title = {Morphological changes during diapause stages in the embryonic cortex of

Abstract = {The annual killifish inhabits in extreme locations with unpredictable
   rainy season where survives through the massive generation of embryos
   resistant of drought, capable to remain in a state of metabolic dormancy
   (three moments of diapause during embryonic development) protected by
   embryonic cortical structures: perivitelline space, egg envelope and its
   ornamented structures (trapeze-shaped projections and filaments in
   Millerichthys robustus). This research describes, for the first time,
   changes in cortical structures during three diapause stages in embryos
   of annual fish M. robustus during an annual life cycle. Embryos were
   collected in three periods through the year in a temporal water body:
   flood, drought and wet. During flood period all embryos were found in
   diapause I (during epiboly, dispersion of the blastomeres stage) with
   maximum thickness in all cortical structures and presence of egg
   envelope filaments. During drought period all embryos were in diapause
   II (development during somitogenesis, before the organogenesis) and its
   structures reduced its thickness significantly and lost the egg envelope
   filaments. Interestingly, embryos in diapause II and III (embryonic
   development completed in a pre hatching stage) were found during wet
   period (an example of bet-hedging strategy) in which all structures
   presented a recovery tending to its original condition observed during
   flood period. This research demonstrates that annual fish embryos
   respond to their exposure to seasonal environmental variations with
   dynamic structural changes that are fundamental for their survival.},

Abstract = {There are a growing number of small childrenas well as adultswith mental
   disabilities (including elderly citizens with Alzheimer's disease or
   other forms of age-related dementia) that are getting lost in rural and
   urban areas for various reasons. Establishing their location within the
   first 72 h is crucial because lost people are exposed to all kinds of
   adverse conditions and in the case of the elderly, this is further
   aggravated if prescribed medication is needed. Herein we describe a
   non-invasive, low-cost electronic device that operates constantly,
   keeping track of time, the geographical location and the identification
   of the subject using it. The prototype was made using commercial
   low-cost electronic components. This electronic device shows high
   connectivity in open and closed areas and identifies the geographical
   location of a lost subject. We freely provide the software and technical
   diagrams of the prototypes.},

Title = {Optimal quantum rotosensors},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW A},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {We look for optimal quantum rotosensors, i.e., quantum spin states that
   are optimal in detecting rotations by a given angle. The exact quantity
   to be minimized is the probability that the rotated state projects onto
   the original one, averaged uniformly over all rotation axes. We show
   analytically that, for small rotation angles, the solution is given by
   anticoherent states. Numerical analysis shows that, for spin s = 1 and
   3/2, there exists, in each case, a critical rotation angle beyond which
   the minimum is instead achieved by the coherent states, the transition
   between the two being discontinuous. For s = 2, a third degenerate
   minimum appears in between the above two, consisting of pairs of
   antipodal points, regardless of the angle between their axes. We also
   determine the worst rotosensors, i.e., those states that maximize the
   above quantity; interestingly, the same set of states shows up but for
   different ranges of the rotation angle.},

Title = {Photonic band-gap and defect modes of a one-dimensional photonic crystal
   under localized compression},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {121},
Number = {17},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {The rupture of periodicity caused by one defect (defect layer) in a
   one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPhC) results in a narrow
   transmission spectral line in the photonic band-gap, and the field
   distribution shows a strong confinement in the proximity of the defect
   layer. In this work, we present a theoretical model to calculate the
   frequency of defect modes caused by defect layers induced by localized
   mechanical stress. Two periodical arrangements were studied: one with
   layers of poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS),
   PMMA-PS; the other with layers of PMMA and fused silica (SiO2),
   PMMA-SiO2. The defect layers were induced by localized compression
   (tension). The frequencies of the defect modes were calculated using
   elasto-optical theory and plane wave expansion and perturbation methods.
   Numerical results show that the frequency of the defect mode increases
   (decreases) when the compression (tension) increases. Based on the
   theoretical model developed, we show that compression of n layers of a
   1DPhC induces n defect modes whose frequencies depend on the compression
   magnitude in the case of normal incidence of electromagnetic waves, in
   accordance with the results reported for other types of defect layers.
   The methodology shows the feasibility of the plane wave expansion and
   perturbation methods to study the frequency of the defect modes. Both
   periodical arrangements are suitable for designing mechanically tunable
   (1DPhC)-based narrow pass band filters and narrow reflectors in the (60,
   65) THz range. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Volume = {64},

Pages = {17-19},
Abstract = {The behavior of a slight chiral bias in favor of L-amino acids over
   D-amino acids was studied in an evolutionary mathematical model
   generating mixed chiral peptide hexamers. The simulations aimed to
   reproduce a very generalized prebiotic scenario involving a specified
   couple of amino acid enantiomers and a possible asymmetric amplification
   through autocatalytic peptide self-replication while forming small
   multimers of a defined length. Our simplified model allowed the
   observation of a small ascending but not conclusive tendency in the
   L-amino acid over the D-amino acid profile for the resulting mixed
   chiral hexamers in computer simulations of 100 peptide generations. This
   simulation was carried out by changing the chiral bias from 1\% to 3\%,
   in three stages of 15, 50 and 100 generations to observe any alteration
   that could mean a drastic change in behavior. So far, our simulations
   lead to the assumption that under the exposure of very slight
   non-racemic conditions, a significant bias between L- and D-amino acids,
   as present in our biosphere, was unlikely generated under prebiotic
   conditions if autocatalytic peptide self-replication was the main or the
   only driving force of chiral auto-amplification.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the polar profile of ancient proteins using a
   comparative study of amino acids found in 25 000 000-year-old shells
   described in Abelson's work. We simulated the polar profile with a
   computer platform that represented an evolutionary computational toy
   model that mimicked the generation of small proteins starting from a
   pool of monomeric amino acids and that included several dynamic
   properties, such as self-replication and fragmentation-recombination of
   the proteins. The simulations were taken up to 15 generations and
   produced a considerable number of proteins of 25 amino acids in length.
   The computational model included the amino acids found in the ancient
   shells, the thermal degradation factor, and the relative abundance of
   the amino acids observed in the Miller-Urey experimental simulation of
   the prebiotic amino acid formation. We found that the amino acid polar
   profiles of the ancient shells and those simulated and extrapolated from

Abstract = {A surface radio frequency coil was developed for small animal image
   acquisition in a pre-clinical magnetic resonance imaging system at 7 T.
   A flexible coil composed of two circular loops was developed to closely
   cover the object to be imaged. Electromagnetic numerical simulations
   were performed to evaluate its performance before the coil construction.
   An analytical expression of the mutual inductance for the two circular
   loops as a function of the separation between them was derived and used
   to validate the simulations. The RF coil is composed of two circular
   loops with a 5 cm external diameter and was tuned to 300 MHz and 50 Ohms
   matched. The angle between the loops was varied and the Q factor was
   obtained from the S-11 simulations for each angle. B1 homogeneity was
   also evaluated using the electromagnetic simulations. The coil prototype
   was designed and built considering the numerical simulation results. To
   show the feasibility of the coil and its performance, saline-solution
   phantom images were acquired. A correlation of the simulations and
   imaging experimental results was conducted showing a concordance of 0.88
   for the B-1 field. The best coil performance was obtained at the 90
   degrees aperture angle. A more realistic phantom was also built using a
   formaldehyde-fixed rat phantom for ex vivo imaging experiments. All
   images showed a good image quality revealing clearly defined anatomical
   details of an ex vivo rat.},

Title = {Peptide presentation on primate erythroparvovirus 1 virus-like
   particles: In vitro assembly, stability and immunological properties},
Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {224},
Pages = {12-18},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Virus-like particles (VLPs) have demonstrated to be valuable scaffolds
   for the display of heterologous peptides for vaccine development and
   other specific interactions. VLPs of primate erythroparvovirus 1,
   generally referred as parvovirus B19 (B19V), have already been produced
   in-vivo and in-vitro from the recombinant VP2 protein of this virus. In
   this study, chimeric forms of B19V VP2 were constructed, and their
   ability to assemble into VLPs was evaluated. Chimeras were composed of
   the VP2 protein fused, at its N-terminus, with two peptides derived from
   the fusion glycoprotein (F) of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
   The chimeric proteins self-assembled into VLPs morphologically similar
   to B19V virions. Stability of these VLPs was analyzed under denaturation
   conditions with guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl). Our results indicate that
   the presence of the heterologous fragments increased the stability of
   VLPs assembled by any of the VP2 chimeras. Specific proteolysis assays
   shown that a fraction of the N-termini of the chimeric proteins is
   located on the outer surface of the VLPs. Immunogenicity of VLPs against
   RSV was evaluated and the results indicate that the particles can elicit
   a humoral immune response, although these antibodies did not cross-react
   with RSV in ELISA tests. These results provide novel insights into the
   localization of the N-termini of B19V VP2 protein after in vitro
   assembly into VLPs, and point them to be attractive sites to display
   peptides or proteins without compromise the assembly or stability of
   VLPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leaves of Omphalea oleifera Hemsl. damaged by Urania fulgens Walker were
   examined. Leaves were anatomically described, histochemical tests were
   performed and the content of lignin and phenolic acids estimated.
   Morpho-anatomical features were similar in damaged leaves and the
   control, but minor histochemical differences were observed. The tissues
   adjacent to the damage showed lignin deposits and calcium oxalate
   crystals. The estimated amounts of lignin and cafeic, ferulic and
   chlorogenic acids were respectively 11\% and 109.65, 16.58 and 0.082 mu
   g.g(-1) dry wt in the damaged leaves, whereas for the intact were 7\%,
   97.65, 5.48 and 0.051 mu g.g(-1) dry wt. The results suggest that the
   insect damage triggers induced responses in O. oleifera including
   production and accumulation of phenolic compounds and calcium oxalate

Title = {Elasto-optical effect on the band structure of a one-dimensional

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The devices formed using photonic crystals are based on the response to
   physical stimuli and depend on the properties of the media. Recently,
   there has been an increase in the application of photonic crystals in
   several fields through the use of several techniques. In particular,
   multilayer films are used as filters and reflectors in the THz range and
   as pressure sensors. The band structure of a 1D photonic crystal under
   hydrostatic pressure was studied. The materials used for the alternating
   layer structures were considered homogeneous, isotropic, elastic, and
   non-magnetic. The change in permittivity of the materials was calculated
   using the elasto-optical effect. The frequency spectrum of the photonic
   crystal was determined from the eigenvalues equation for the magnetic
   intensity vector using the plane wave expansion method. Two photonic
   arrangements with different mechanical properties were proposed:
   poly(methyl methacrylate)-polystyrene, and poly(methyl
   methacrylate)-silica. Numerical results showed that the bandgap of both
   arrangements tend toward higher frequencies when the hydrostatic
   pressure increases and that the bandgap width varies with the
   hydrostatic pressure. It was concluded that, if the mechanical
   properties of both layers are similar, such as in the case of polymers,
   the bandgap width is constant. If the layer with the higher permittivity
   is less rigid than the other layer, such as in the second arrangement,
   the bandgap width reaches a minimum at a determined value of the
   pressure. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America},

Abstract = {Nucleolar assembly is a cellular event that requires the synthesis and
   processing of ribosomal RNA, in addition to the participation of
   pre-nucleolar bodies (PNBs) at the end of mitosis. Inmammals and plants,
   nucleolar biogenesis has been described in detail, but in unicellular
   eukaryotes it is a poorly understood process. In this study, we used
   light and electron microscopy cytochemical techniques to investigate the
   distribution of nucleolar components in the pathway of nucleolus
   rebuilding during closed cell division in epimastigotes of Trypanosoma
   cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis. Silver
   impregnation specific for nucleolar organizer regions and an
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid regressive procedure to preferentially
   stain ribonucleoprotein revealed the conservation and dispersion of
   nucleolar material throughout the nucleoplasm during cell division.
   Furthermore, at the end of mitosis, the argyrophilic proteins were
   concentrated in the nucleolar organizer region. Unexpectedly,
   accumulation of nucleolar material in the form of PNBs was not
   visualized. We suggest that formation of the nucleolus in epimastigotes
   of T. cruzi occurs by a process that does not require the concentration
   of nucleolar material within intermediate nuclear bodies such as
   mammalian and plant PNBs.},

Abstract = {We introduce two types of graphical log-linear models: label- and
   level-invariant models for triangle-free graphs. These models generalise
   symmetry concepts in graphical log-linear models and provide a tool with
   which to model symmetry in the discrete case. A label-invariant model is
   category-invariant and is preserved after permuting some of the vertices
   according to transformations that maintain the graph, whereas a
   level-invariant model equates expected frequencies according to a given
   set of permutations. These new models can both be seen as instances of a
   new type of graphical log-linear model termed the restricted graphical
   log-linear model, or RGLL, in which equality restrictions on subsets of
   main effects and first-order interactions are imposed. Their likelihood
   equations and graphical representation can be obtained from those
   derived for the RGLL models.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of packing unequal circles in a
   fixed size circular container, where the objective is to maximise the
   value of the circles packed. We consider two different objectives:
   maximise the number of circles packed; maximise the area of the circles
   packed.
   For the particular case when the objective is to maximise the number of
   circles packed we prove that the optimal solution is of a particular
   form.
   We present a heuristic for the problem based upon formulation space
   search. Computational results are given for a number of publicly
   available test problems involving the packing of up to 40 circles. We
   also present computational results, for test problems taken from the
   literature, relating to packing both equal and unequal circles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {We consider Gaussian graphical tree models in discriminant analysis for
   two populations. Both the parameters and the structure of the graph are
   assumed to be unknown. For the estimation of the parameters maximum
   likelihood is used, and for the estimation of the structure of the tree
   graph we propose three methods; in these, the function to be optimized
   is the J-divergence for one and the empirical log-likelihood ratio for
   the two others. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction
   of these three computationally efficient methods. We show that the
   optimization problem of each proposed method is equivalent to one of
   finding a minimum weight spanning tree, which can be solved efficiently
   even if the number of variables is large. This property together with
   the existence of the maximum likelihood estimators for small group
   sample sizes is the main advantage of the proposed methods. A numerical
   comparison of the classification performance of discriminant analysis
   using these methods, as well as three other existing ones, is presented.
   This comparison is based on the estimated error rates of the
   corresponding plug-in allocation rules obtained from real and simulated
   data. Diagonal discriminant analysis is considered as a benchmark, as
   well as quadratic and linear discriminant analysis whenever the sample
   size is sufficient. The results show that discriminant analysis with
   Gaussian tree models, using these methods for selecting the graph
   structure, is competitive with diagonal discriminant analysis in
   high-dimensional settings.},

Title = {SAR of a birdcage coil with variable number of rungs at 300 MHz},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The specific absorption rate produced in a rat's brain phantom inside of
   quadrature bird-cage coil as a function of the rung number was studied
   at 300 MHz. Electromagnetic field simulations and specific absorption
   rate and loss return responses were performed using a rat's brain
   phantom weighing 100 mg. To assure optimal simulations and to evaluate
   coil performance, S-parameters were simulated and compared with
   experimentally data. Simulations showed that magnetic field uniformity
   improves and that electric field is increased with the number of rungs.
   Specific absorption rate and temperature values obtained from axial
   bi-dimensional maps increase as the number of rungs grows. These results
   corroborated very well with published data. A quadrature 16-rung
   birdcage coil was developed for comparison and phantom images were
   acquired to show its feasibility. The presented approach yields
   information on specific absorption rate allowing to previously develop
   RF coils and their possible effects on the biological sample. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Currently, the Annonaceae family is characterised by the production of
   acetogenins (ACGs), and also by the biosynthesis of alkaloids. primarily
   benzylisoquinolines derived from tyrosine. The objective of this study
   was to confirm the presence of alkaloids and acetogenins in the
   idioblasts of the endosperm and the embryonic axis of A.
   macroprophyllata seeds in germination. The Dragendorff, Dittmar, Ellram.
   and Lugol reagents were used to test for alkaloids, and Kedde's reagent
   was used to determine the presence of acetogenins in fresh sections of
   the endosperm and embryonic axis of seeds after twelve days of
   germination. A positive reaction was observed for all the reagents, and
   the presence of alkaloids and acetogenins was confirmed in the
   idioblasts of the endosperm and those involved in the differentiation of
   the embryonic axis of the developing seedling. We concluded that the
   idioblasts store both metabolites, acetogenins and alkaloids. Beginning
   at differentiation, the idioblasts of the embryonic axis simultaneously
   biosynthesise acetogenins and alkaloids that are characteristic of the
   species during the development of the seedling. The method used here can
   be applied to histochemically confirm the presence of acetogenins and
   alkaloids in tissues and structures of the plant in different stages of
   its life cycle.},

   a review},
Journal = {ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA},

Pages = {229-233},
Abstract = {Proteins in the post-genome era impose diverse research challenges, the
   main are the understanding of their structure-function mechanism, and
   the growing need for new pharmaceutical drugs, particularly antibiotics
   that help clinicians treat the ever-increasing number of
   Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs). Although, there is a wide range
   of mathematical-computational algorithms to satisfy the demand, among
   them the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship algorithms that
   have shown better performance using a characteristic training data of
   the property searched; their performance has stagnated regardless of the
   number of metrics they evaluate and their complexity. This article
   reviews the characteristics of these metrics, and the need to reconsider
   the mathematical structure that expresses them, directing their design
   to a more comprehensive algebraic structure. It also shows how the main
   function of a protein can be determined by measuring the polarity of its
   linear sequence, with a high level of accuracy, and how such exhaustive
   metric stands as a ``fingerprint{''} that can be applied to scan the
   protein regions to obtain new pharmaceutical drugs, and thus to
   establish how the singularities led to the specialization of the protein
   groups known today.},

   This supervised method uses only eigenvectors from the incident polar
   matrix of the group studied. It was verified with a comparative study
   with another extensively verified method developed previously by our
   team, the Polarity Index Method. The number of positive hits of both
   methods was up to 98\% in all the tests conducted.},

Abstract = {The parallel-plate waveguide (PPWG) has been employed due to the fact
   that all frequencies can propagate, because its cut-off frequency is
   zero for the lowest-order transverse electric mode. The electromagnetic
   interaction between the waveguide and the RF subsystem of a Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner may be a cause of concern in terms of
   the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and image distortion. We have
   numerically simulated the electromagnetic interaction between a
   parallel-plate waveguide and a Maxwell gradient in the z-axis direction.
   Theoretical results were also obtained for the gradients only and
   compared with the numerically-acquired results involving the waveguide
   agreement was found between numerical and theoretical results. SAR
   calculations of a phantom inside the waveguide were also obtained to
   evaluate the parallel-plate waveguide performance. Global SAR values
   within the safety limits for human. Numerical results of SAR also showed
   that the use of a parallel-plate waveguide attenuates the global SAR
   values.},

Abstract = {A scaled-down slotted surface radio frequency (RF) coil was built, and
   the specific absorbance rate (SAR) in 100 mg of tissue (SAR(100 mg))
   produced in a rat brain phantom was computed at 7 T.
   A slotted coil 2-cm in diameter with six circular slots was developed.
   Its theoretical and experimental performance was computed and compared
   using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expression and phantom images
   obtained with a spin echo sequence. Electromagnetic simulations were
   performed using the finite integral method with saline sphere and rat
   brain phantoms. SAR(100 mg) was computed for the circular coil, by
   varying its radius, and was also computed for the slotted coil.
   The slotted coil quality factor gave a twofold increment over the
   circular coil, and noise was reduced by 17 \%. The experimental SNR of
   the slotted coil produced a 30 \% improvement for points near the coil
   plane. The theoretical and experimental results showed substantial
   agreement. Axial map histograms and profiles showed greater SAR(100 mg)
   values for the circular coil than for the slotted coil.
   The slotted surface coil offers improved performance and low SAR(100 mg)
   for rat brain imaging at 7 T. This approach may be used with new RF
   coils to investigate SAR in humans.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify visible and microscopic
   symptoms as well as certain biochemical changes associated with chilling
   injury (CI) in Atlixco cactus stems. Cladodes were harvested,
   disinfected, minimally processed and stored at 4, 12 and 26C for 14-21
   days. Results indicated that cactus stems were sensitive to CI at 4 and
   12C and exhibited pitting and bronzing as visible symptoms of this
   disorder. Confocal microscopy showed that mitochondrial integrity was
   maintained at 4C whereas a deterioration of these organelles occurred at
   12 and 26C. Electrolyte leakage, together with an increase in the levels
   of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione and the reduced form of
   ascorbic acid were associated with CI. In spite of the presence of CI at
   4C, cactus stems were still able to preserve their taste quality and no
   adverse effects were observed on either firmness or color for 21 days.
   Practical ApplicationsMinimally processed products should be
   refrigerated at 4C in order to maintain their quality and prevent the
   growth of harmful microorganisms. However, the refrigeration of cactus
   stems at suboptimal temperatures causes the appearance of chilling
   injury (CI). Previous studies have mentioned the general symptoms of
   this physiological disorder in cactus stems, but no one has described
   the symptomatology in detail and there is yet to be reported
   histological and biochemical characterization that might serve to
   confirm or diagnose its presence. This study describes the symptoms of
   CI and provides histological and biochemical indicators for its early
   identification during storage. It also constitutes the preliminary stage
   to the future application of postharvest technologies that induce
   tolerance to CI, preventing browning and preserving the quality of
   minimally processed cactus stems in order to expand their domestic and
   international markets.},

Abstract = {Malnutrition during brain development can cause serious problems that
   can be irreversible. Dysfunctional patterns of brain activity can be
   detected with functional MRI. We used BOLD functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) to investigate region differences of brain activity
   between control and malnourished rats. The food-competition method was
   applied to a rat model to induce malnutrition during lactation. A 7T
   magnet was used to detect changes of the BOLD signal associated with
   changes in brain activity caused by the trigeminal nerve stimulation in
   malnourished and control rats. Major neuronal activation was observed in
   malnourished rats in several brain regions, including cerebellum,
   somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Statistical
   analysis of the BOLD signals from various brain areas revealed
   significant differences in somatosensory cortex between the control and
   experimental groups, as well as a significant difference between the
   cerebellum and other structures in the experimental group. This study,
   particularly in malnourished rats, demonstrates increased BOLD
   activation in the cerebellum.},

Abstract = {Introduction. The edible fruit of jiotilla (Escontria chiotilla (Weber)
   Rose), a cactus endemic to Central Mexico, mature asynchronously and are
   characterized by the presence of bracts in the fruit peel (pericarpel).
   In order to establish a harvest index, a series of physical, chemical,
   and morphological classical parameters coupled with histological
   observations were determined at four different stages of fruit
   development from anthesis to mature fruit (S1-S4). Materials and
   methods. Flowers and fruit samples at each stage were collected for
   analysis from randomly selected plants from the desert shrub. Results
   and discussion. The single sigmoid growth curve exhibited major and
   minor changes between S2 and S3, S3 and S4, respectively. Growth
   cessation and maturation began at S3, the maximum concentration of total
   sugars occurred in S3, and the maximum value of firmness decreased in S3
   and S4. A thinning of the fruit peel due to aerenchyma compression
   occurred in the transition period S3-S4 and fruit firmness was the
   mechanical parameter more closely associated with it. Poor relationships
   with ripening stages were shown by the other physicochemical parameters
   measured. Conclusions. We propose two morphological-histological
   indicators of harvest: 1) Fruit peel thickness, and 2) Color and texture
   changes of the bracts. The infundibuliform flower adapted to confine,
   protect and improve the aqueous reserves in the ovary of the cactus
   species becoming a special berry with a successful strategy for saving
   water during fruit development and ripening. This strategy involves

Title = {Structural equation modeling as a tool to develop conservation
   strategies using environmental indicators: The case of the forests of
   the Magdalena river basin in Mexico City},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A primarily descriptive approach has been used to develop studies in
   Mexico that use indicators to incorporate information on the
   conservation state of ecosystems. Consequently, these studies are not
   well supported by ecological data, or they lack an analysis of
   socio-ecological integration, making it difficult to implement the
   strategies derived from these conservation plans. Structural equations
   models (SEM) help with the understanding of direct and indirect
   interactions between variables and, consequently, allow the detection of
   root causes of change. In this study, a method to integrate indicators
   in relation to a pressure-state-response model was developed and applied
   to a forest in Mexico City. We developed the model using 21
   environmental units, 17 state indicators of biodiversity (evaluating
   three aspects of the ecosystem: structure, composition and function), 14
   environmental indicators (abiotic variables) and 6 anthropogenic
   pressure indicators. Subsequently, based on multicollinearity tests,
   redundant indicators were eliminated. A canonical correspondence
   analysis was carried out to establish the relationship between different
   indicators and the possible ecological connections of the SEM. With the
   previous information, an a priori model of the influence of pressure and
   environmental indicators on the structure, composition and function of
   the ecosystem was developed.
   The SEM results enabled us to evaluate the direct and indirect causes of
   degradation. Some environmental factors, such as the global site factor,
   humidity, air temperature, organic matter in the soil, slope, and soil
   pH, had a greater effect on the structure, composition and function
   indicators registered in the environmental units of the basin than other
   factors. The pressure factors that most affected the three aspects of
   the ecosystem were visitors, rubbish, fire incidence, and human
   activities. Pressure factors affected composition and structure
   indicators, though the effect on the function indicators was weak. It is
   possible to conclude that although the ecosystem appears to be changed
   by some disturbance factors, these factors have not yet altered the
   functionality of the ecosystem. Finally, from the model, a set of
   proposals and strategies for management was developed. These strategies
   can be used to sustain the biodiversity of each environmental unit. (C)

Abstract = {Infections arising from bacterial adhesion and colonization on chronic
   wounds are a significant healthcare problem. Silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs) impregnated in dressing have attracted a great deal of attention
   as a potential solution. The goal of the present study was to evaluate
   the anti-biofilm activities of AgNPs impregnated in commercial dressings
   against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria isolated of chronic wounds from
   a hospital patient. The antimicrobial activity of AgNPs was tested
   within biofilms generated under slow fluid shear conditions using a
   standard bioreactor. A 2-log reduction in the number of colony-forming
   units of P. aeruginosa was recorded in the reactor on exposure to
   dressing impregnated with 250 ppm of AgNPs, diameter 9.3 +/- 1.1 nm, and
   also showed compatibility to mammalian cells (human fibroblasts). Our
   study suggests that the use of dressings with AgNPs may either prevent
   or reduce microbial growth in the wound environment and reducing wound
   bioburden may improve wound-healing outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Although aging is a known risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
   (IPF), the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the effects of advancing
   age remain largely unexplained. Some age-related neurodegenerative
   diseases have an etiology that is related to mitochondria! dysfunction.
   Here, we found that alveolar type II cells (AECIIs) in the lungs of IPF
   patients exhibit marked accumulation of dysmorphic and dysfunctional
   mitochondria. These mitochondrial abnormalities in AECIIs of IPF lungs
   were associated with upregulation of ER stress markers and were
   recapitulated in normal mice with advancing age in response to
   stimulation of ER stress. We found that impaired mitochondria in IPF and
   aging lungs were associated with low expression of PTEN-induced putative
   kinase 1 (PINK1). Knockdown of PINK1 expression in lung epithelial cells
   resulted in mitochondria depolarization and expression of profibrotic
   factors. Moreover, young PINK1-deficient mice developed similarly
   dysmorphic, dysfunctional mitochondria in the AECIIs and were vulnerable
   to apoptosis and development of lung fibrosis. Our data indicate that
   PINK1 deficiency results in swollen, dysfunctional mitochondria and
   defective mitophagy, and promotes fibrosis in the aging lung.},

Abstract = {The aging of the population in the United States and throughout the
   developed world has increased morbidity and mortality attributable to
   lung disease, while the morbidity and mortality from other prevalent
   diseases has declined or remained stable. Recognizing the importance of
   aging in the development of lung disease, the American Thoracic Society
   (ATS) highlighted this topic as a core theme for the 2014 annual
   meeting. The relationship between aging and lung disease was discussed
   in several oral symposiums and poster sessions at the annual ATS
   meeting. In this article, we used the input gathered at the conference
   to develop a broad framework and perspective to stimulate basic,
   clinical, and translational research to understand how the aging process
   contributes to the onset and/or progression of lung diseases. A
   consistent theme that emerged from the conference was the need to apply
   novel, systems-based approaches to integrate a growing body of genomic,
   epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data and elucidate the
   relationship between biologic hallmarks of aging, altered lung function,
   and increased susceptibility to lung diseases in the older population.
   The challenge remains to causally link the molecular and cellular
   changes of aging with age-related changes in lung physiology and disease
   susceptibility. The purpose of this review is to stimulate further
   research to identify new strategies to prevent or treat age-related lung
   disease.},

Title = {PLANTS RELATED TO EARLY EVOLUTIONARY EVENTS (BRYOPHYTES) CONTAIN
   LACANDONIA GRANULES PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED IN FLOWERING PLANTS},
Journal = {ACTA MICROSCOPICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {152-158},
Abstract = {The early evolution of the plant kingdom is controversial, and
   bryophytes are argued to be the earliest divergent plants. Indeed, the
   origin and diversification of land plants marks an interval of
   unparalleled innovation in the history of plant life. Previous
   ultrastructural analysis of the nucleus revealed the presence of
   Lacandonia granules. Cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ
   hybridization studies suggested that Lacandonia granules are involved in
   mRNA storage. In addition, Lacandonia granules have been located in
   other flowering plants of the order Triuridales (such as Triuris alata)
   and also in non-flowering plants. Therefore, in order to understand the
   evolution of RNA processing, we demonstrated the presence of Lacandonia
   granules in three species of non-vascular plants (Bryophytes). In this
   study, we analyzed three species of Bryophytes using transmission
   electron microscopy and found granules in sporophyte cell nuclei of all
   species. Moreover, the presence of few granules in the interchromatin
   and perichromatin space was a constant feature of all nuclei of
   Bryophytes. Thus, non-abundant particles of around 32 nm in diameter
   were observed in the perichromatin and interchromatin space.
   Perichromatin fibers are usually present in continuity with granules,
   forming a fibrogranular environment. Finally, we demonstrated that these
   particles are positive after the EDTA regressive technique preferential
   for ribonucleoproteins. In summary, this study suggests that Lacandonia
   granules contribute to the understanding of the spatiotemporal
   organization of several mRNA processing factors in the nuclear
   subcompartments and verifies the conservation of the event throughout
   the evolutionary process in the Plant Kingdom.},

Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Pages = {523-531},
Abstract = {Heteropterys is the largest genus in the botanical family Malpighiaceae
   that comprises more than 140 species. In the last years there has been
   an increasing interest on Heteropterys species because of the promising
   results of the pharmacological studies that explored Heteropterys
   species for first time. The objective of this review is to provide an
   overview of the active constituents isolated from Heteropterys genus,
   highlighting the aspects reported on the diversity of the biological
   activities tested during the past years. For this purpose, we reviewed
   the scientific literature available for the total number of species that
   belong to Heteropterys in specialized databases. Our findings showed
   that the properties on CNS (anxiolytic, antidepressant, improving
   learning and memory), the antioxidant effects and the protective
   activities of reproductive male organs are the most important biological
   activities reported for species of Heteropterys. Flavonoids are the
   chemicals most conspicuous, following by aliphatic nitro compounds and
   hydroxycinnamic acids identified in Heteropterys. This review pretend to
   be helpful for phytochemists and pharmacologist in the proposal of
   Heteropterys as potential source of metabolites that could be used to
   drug prototypes to many and diverse pathological or physiological
   situations.},

Title = {Identification of Uptake Mechanism of Cell-Penetrating Peptides by their

Journal = {CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS},

Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Pages = {586-598},
Abstract = {In the recent years, so-called cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have
   been in constant study due to its ability to penetrate cell membranes.
   CCPs are characterized by a length of less than 60 amino acids, its
   highly cationic nature and by a positive net charge at neutral pH. For
   the CPPs either an endocytic or non-endocytic uptake mechanism has been
   identified. This work presents the computational polarity index method
   that is able to predict the uptake mechanism of CPPs with an accuracy of
   72\% in a double-blind test. This was achieved by reading the peptide
   sequence and measuring the polarity as one single physico-chemical
   property. The method was verified by extracting all peptides from the
   CPPsite database (April 21, 2014) and its efficiency was tested with
   seven specialized databases of peptides and proteins.},

Abstract = {We present a computational-mathematical algorithm that can identify

   cancer cells and classified in the APD2 database. The algorithm, named
   polarity index method, showed an accuracy of 95\% in a double-blind test
   applied to peptides from eight different databases. The method only
   requires the primary peptide structure, i.e. the amino acid sequence, to
   determine the polarity profile. Formerly, we have used this method to
   identify selective antibacterial peptides with a high efficiency. Our
   present study suggests that this computational method can also be used
   as a first filter in the analysis and identification of peptides and
   proteins that are related to cancer cells.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {938-952},
Abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common types of
   aggressive cancer. The tumor tissue, which shows an active angiogenesis,
   is composed of neoplastic and stromal cells, and an abundant
   inflammatory infiltrate. Angiogenesis is important to support tumor
   growth, while infiltrating cells contribute to the tumor
   microenvironment through the secretion of growth factors, cytokines and
   chemokines, important molecules in the progression of the disease.
   Chemokines are important in development, activation of the immune
   response, and physiological angiogenesis. Chemokines have emerged as
   important regulators in the pathophysiology of cancer. These molecules
   are involved in the angiogenesis/angiostasis balance and in the
   recruitment of tumor infiltrating hematopoietic cells. In addition,
   chemokines promote tumor cell survival, as well as the directing and
   establishment of tumor cells to metastasis sites. The findings
   summarized here emphasize the central role of chemokines as modulators
   of tumor angiogenesis and their potential role as therapeutic targets in
   the inflammatory process of NSCLC angiogenesis.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A total of 27 strains of Oculatella were isolated, characterized and
   sequenced, and analysed phylogenetically with an additional
   environmental clone from the Atacama Desert and 10 strains isolated and
   sequenced by others. The strains were clearly separated based upon
   phylogenetic analyses conducted with a concatenated alignment of the 16S
   rRNA and 16S-23S ITS region of the ribosomal operons in the genus
   Oculatella. Differences in secondary structure of the conserved domains
   of the ITS region, as well as comparative analysis of P-distance among
   ITS regions, served to separate the strains into distinct taxonomic
   units. Seven new species of Oculatella were described, including four
   from arid to semi-arid soils (O. atacamensis, O. mojaviensis, O.
   coburnii, O. neakameniensis) and three from more mesic habitats,
   including a temperate lake (O. hafneriensis), a desert waterfall (O.
   cataractarum) and a Hawaiian sea cave (O. kauaiensis). The soil forms
   show statistically significant morphological differences, but the ranges
   overlap to a degree that they are not diagnosable by morphology, and
   these four cryptic species are characterized here using molecular
   characters. The more mesic species, including the type species from
   Mediterranean hypogea, O. subterranea, are all morphologically distinct
   from each other and from all four soil taxa. This report is the first to
   use solely molecular criteria to distinguish cryptic species of
   cyanobacteria.},

Abstract = {Recent work on genomics and race makes the argument that concepts and
   categories of race are subtly reproduced in the practice of genomic
   science, despite the explicit rejection of race as meaningful biological
   reality by many geneticists. Our argument in this paper is that
   racialized meanings in genomics, rather than standing alone, are very
   often wrapped up in ideas about nation. This seems to us a rather
   neglected aspect in the literature about genomics and race. More
   specifically, we characterize race as an absent presence in Latin
   America and argue that genomics in the region finds a particular
   expression of race through concepts of nation, because this vehicle
   suits the deep-rooted ambiguity of race in the region. To make this
   argument we use data from an ethnographic project with genetics labs in
   Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the taxonomic diversity of cyanobacteria in
   deserts, despite their important ecological roles in these ecosystems.
   In this study, cyanobacterial strains from the Atacama, Colorado, and
   Mojave Deserts were isolated and characterized using molecular,
   morphological, and ecological information. Phylogenetic placement of
   these strains was revealed through Bayesian and parsimony-based
   phylogenetic analyses utilizing sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and the
   associated 16S-23S ITS region. Based on the combined evidence of this
   polyphasic approach, a new species from desert soils morphologically
   corresponding to the genus Trichocoleus was described. Trichocoleus
   desertorum sp. nov. Muhlsteinova, Johansen et Pietrasiak was used to
   obtain a phylogenetic reference point for Trichocoleus, a genus so far
   characterized by morphological description only. Through
   characterization of this new taxon in desert soils we hope to contribute
   to the general understanding of cyanobacterial diversity in extreme arid
   habitats.},

Journal = {NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Decreasing neighborhood with distance has been identified as one of a
   few conditions to achieve final states in the self-organizing map (SOM)
   that resemble the distribution of high-dimensional input data. In the
   classic SOM model, best matching units (BMU) decrease their influence
   area as a function of distance. We introduce a modification to the SOM
   algorithm in which neighborhood is contemplated from the point of view
   of affected units, not from the view of BMUs. In our proposal,
   neighborhood for BMUs is not reduced, instead the rest of the units
   exclude some BMUs from affecting them. Each neuron identifies, from the
   set of BMUs that influenced it in previous epochs, those to whom it
   becomes refractory to for the rest of the process. Despite that the
   condition of decreasing neighborhood over distance is not maintained,
   self-organization still persists, as shown by several experiments. The
   maps achieved by the proposed modification have, in many cases, a lower
   error measure than the maps formed by SOM. Also, the model is able to
   remove discontinuities (kinks) from the map in a very small number of
   epochs, which contrasts with the original SOM model.},

Journal = {INLAND WATERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {279-292},
Abstract = {We examined community structure of benthic diatoms and their substratum
   preferences (epilithic vs. macroalgae) by season in 4 tropical mountain
   streams in central Mexico. Of the 74 species compiled, Cymbella
   silesiaca, Rhoicosphenia abbreviate, and Reimeria sinuata were the most
   abundant and frequent. About 14\% of species were exclusively epilithic,
   13\% were associated with macroalgae, and 73\% had no clear preference.
   Environmental factors most closely related to spatial and temporal
   distribution of epilithic diatoms were changes in stream discharge and
   water temperature. For diatoms associated with macroalgae, the most
   important factors were changes in current velocity and the coverage and
   richness of macroalgae. The similarities in species richness and
   diversity in the 4 study sites suggest that the diatom community
   develops under conditions of moderate disturbance. The few differences
   found in species richness between epilithic and macroalgae-associated
   diatoms suggest that these diatoms do not have substratum preferences.
   The abundance of macroalgae-associated diatoms in all sites suggests a
   positive effect (facilitation) of macroalgae on diatoms.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the problem of power allocation in a wireless network is
   studied with a distributed perspective by taking into account
   multiple-access interference in the communication channel, non-uniform
   quantization and floating-point operations. These three effects can be
   characterized by multiplicative uncertainty models in the forward and
   feedback paths of a closed-loop power control strategy. The quality of
   service (QoS) in the wireless data transmission is evaluated with
   respect to signal to interference-noise ratio (SINR) after the
   estimation process, where the uplink channel (active users to base
   station) is addressed by its implications with respect to battery
   consumption. The multiplicative uncertainty terms are modeled by a
   stochastic framework, and the mean-square small gain theorem is employed
   to evaluate robust stability. Two inequalities are then derived to check
   internal stability with respect to the norms of the multiplicative
   uncertainty terms, and sensitivity and complementary sensitivity
   transfer functions of the closed-loop system. As a case study we
   considered an LQG controller in each active user for power allocation,
   whose structure allows to derive simplified inequalities to evaluate
   robust stability.},

Abstract = {Tilia genus is commonly used around the world for its central nervous
   system properties; it is prepared as tea and used as tranquilizing,
   anticonvulsant, and analgesic. In this study, anticonvulsant activity of
   the Tilia americana var. mexicana inflorescences and leaves was
   investigated by evaluating organic and aqueous extracts (100, 300, and
   600 mg/kg, i.p.) and some flavonoids in the pentylenetetrazole-induced
   seizures in mice. Moreover, antioxidant effect of these extracts and
   flavonoids was examined in an in vitro study by using spectrophotometric
   technique. Significant activity was observed in the methanol extract
   from inflorescences. An HPLC analysis of the methanol extract from
   inflorescences and leaves of Tilia allowed demonstrating the respective
   presence of some partial responsible flavonoid constituents: quercetin
   (20.09 +/- 1.20 mu g/mg and 3.39 +/- 0.10 mu g/mg), rutin (3.52 +/- 0.21
   mu g/mg and 8.94 +/- 0.45 mu g/mg), and isoquercitrin (1.74 +/- 0.01 mu
   g/mg and 1.24 +/- 0.13 mu g/mg). In addition, significant but different
   antioxidant properties were obtained among the flavonoids and the
   extracts investigated. Our results provide evidence of the
   anticonvulsant activity of Tilia reinforcing its utility for central
   nervous system diseases whose mechanism of action might involve partial
   antioxidant effects due to the presence of flavonoids.},

Abstract = {TB, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is one of the major
   global infectious diseases. For the pandemic control, early diagnosis
   with sensitive and specific methods is fundamental. With the advent of
   bioinformatics' tools, the identification of several proteins involved
   in the pathogenesis of TB (TB) has been possible. In the present work,
   the MTB genome was explored to look for molecules with possible
   antigenic properties for their evaluation as part of new generation
   diagnostic kits based on the release of cytokines. Seven proteins from
   the MTB proteome and some of their combinations suited the computational
   test and the results suggested their potential use for the diagnosis of
   infection in the following population groups: Cuba, Mexico, Malaysia and
   sub-Saharan Africa. Our predictions were performed using public
   bioinformatics tools plus three computer programs, developed by our
   group, to facilitate information retrieval and processing.},

Abstract = {We studied the CO2 concentration in the soil air of Folic Albic Podzols
   at heights of 2500 and 2400 m a.s.l. within the area of montane cloud
   forests of southern Mexico. Soil air samples were collected from the
   depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm every three hours from 9 a.m. to
   18 p.m. during one day. The mean CO2 concentrations in the soil air at
   the heights of 2500 and 2400 m a.s.l. reached 2170 and 6930 ppm,
   respectively. The spatial and temporal variability of the CO2
   concentration in the soil air of the Podzols of the montane cloud forest
   were revealed. The spatial variability was controlled by the differences
   in the species composition of the surface vegetation and the depth of
   the soil organic horizon, whereas the temporal variability was related
   to the generally low level of aeration of the topsoil layer and,
   presumably, to the cyclic pattern of the root respiration.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {98},
Number = {4},
Pages = {876-877},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Among spiders, scorpions, and whip spiders, a common type of maternal
   care consists of females carrying newly hatched offspring on their body
   for a few days until they are able to live independently. While this
   maternal care has been suggested to occur in different argasid tick
   species, it has been recorded only once, for Antricola marginatus in
   Cuba; however, this earlier record only superficially mentioned the
   occurrence of this behavior, with no further details. Here we report the
   occurrence of maternal care in the argasid tick A. marginatus under
   natural conditions in a cave at Yucatan. Mexico, where 8 A. marginatus
   females, while walking on bat guano, had their body entirely covered by
   a mean number of 305 +/- 112 conspecific unfed larvae (range: 105-466).
   Larvae covered the entire idiosoma of the female tick, where they were
   motionless or displayed just slight movement. This result substantially
   expands the number of unique characters that have been found only in
   Antricola spp, ticks, when compared to the other tick genera. Our
   findings also indicate that maternal care evolved independently in
   different taxa of Arachnida, since it has been reported for species of
   Araneae, Scorpiones, and Amblypygi, and here for an Acari species.},

Abstract = {The mammalian cell nucleus is functionally compartmentalized into
   various substructures. Nuclear speckles, also known as interchromatin
   granule clusters, are enriched with SR splicing factors and are
   implicated in gene expression. Here we report that nuclear speckle
   formation is developmentally regulated; in certain cases phosphorylated
   SR proteins are absent from the nucleus and are instead localized at
   granular structures in the cytoplasm. To investigate how the nuclear
   architecture is formed, we performed a phenotypic screen of HeLa cells
   treated with a series of small interfering RNAs. Depletion of
   Ran-binding protein 2 induced cytoplasmic intermediates of nuclear
   speckles in G1 phase. Detailed analyses of these structures suggested
   that a late step in the sequential nuclear entry of mitotic
   interchromatin granule components was disrupted and that phosphorylated
   SR proteins were sequestered in an SR protein kinase-dependent manner.
   As a result, the cells had an imbalanced subcellular distribution of
   phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated SR proteins, which affected
   alternative splicing patterns. This study demonstrates that the speckled
   distribution of phosphorylated pre-mRNA processing factors is regulated
   by the nucleocytoplasmic transport system in mammalian cells and that it
   is important for alternative splicing.},

Title = {Activated MCTC mast cells infiltrate diseased lung areas in
   cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis},
Journal = {RESPIRATORY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Background: Although mast cells are regarded as important regulators of
   inflammation and tissue remodelling, their role in cystic fibrosis (CF)
   and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has remained less studied. This
   study investigates the densities and phenotypes of mast cell populations
   in multiple lung compartments from patients with CF, IPF and never
   smoking controls.
   Methods: Small airways, pulmonary vessels, and lung parenchyma were
   subjected to detailed immunohistochemical analyses using lungs from
   patients with CF (20 lung regions; 5 patients), IPF (21 regions; 7
   patients) and controls (16 regions; 8 subjects). In each compartment the
   densities and distribution of MCT and MCTC mast cell populations were
   studied as well as the mast cell expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta.
   Results: In the alveolar parenchyma in lungs from patients with CF, MCTC
   numbers increased in areas showing cellular inflammation or fibrosis
   compared to controls. Apart from an altered balance between MCTC and MCT
   cells, mast cell in CF lungs showed elevated expression of IL-6. In CF,
   a decrease in total mast cell numbers was observed in small airways and
   pulmonary vessels. In patients with IPF, a significantly elevated MCTC
   density was present in fibrotic areas of the alveolar parenchyma with
   increased mast cell expression of TGF-beta. The total mast cell density
   was unchanged in small airways and decreased in pulmonary vessels in
   IPF. Both the density, as well as the percentage, of MCTC correlated
   positively with the degree of fibrosis. The increased density of MCTC,
   as well as MCTC expression of TGF-beta, correlated negatively with
   patient lung function.
   Conclusions: The present study reveals that altered mast cell
   populations, with increased numbers of MCTC in diseased alveolar
   parenchyma, represents a significant component of the histopathology in
   CF and IPF. The mast cell alterations correlated to the degree of tissue
   remodelling and to lung function parameters. Further investigations of
   mast cells in these diseases may open for new therapeutic strategies.},

   clinical course was favorable with complete recovery of liver function.
   The second case was a male who developed acute liver failure (ALF) after
   ingestion of Amanita bisporigera. He required MARS therapy as a bridge
   to liver transplantation but transplantation was not performed because
   he succumbed to multiorgan failure. There are few trials demonstrating
   the efficacy of the different treatments for mushroom poisoning. These
   cases demonstrate that the consumption of wild mushrooms without proper
   knowledge of toxic. species represents a serious and under recognized
   health problem.},

Title = {Immunoglobulin Free Light Chains Are Increased in Hypersensitivity
   Pneumonitis and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a devastating lung
   disorder of unknown aetiology, and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis
   (HP), a disease provoked by an immunopathologic reaction to inhaled
   antigens, are two common interstitial lung diseases with uncertain
   pathogenic mechanisms. Previously, we have shown in other upper and
   lower airway diseases that immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) are
   increased and may be involved in initiating a local inflammation. In
   this study we explored if such a mechanism may also apply to HP and IPF.
   Methods: In this study we examined the presence of FLC in serum and BAL
   fluid from 21 IPF and 22 HP patients and controls. IgG, IgE and tryptase
   concentrations were measured in BAL fluid only. The presence of FLCs,
   plasma cells, B cells and mast cells in lung tissue of 3 HP and 3 IPF
   patients and 1 control was analyzed using immunohistochemistry.
   Results: FLC concentrations in serum and BAL fluid were increased in IPF
   and HP patients as compared to control subjects. IgG concentrations were
   only increased in HP patients, whereas IgE concentrations were
   comparable to controls in both patient groups. FLC-positive cells, B
   cells, plasma cells, and large numbers of activated mast cells were all
   detected in the lungs of HP and IPF patients, not in control lung.
   Conclusion: These results show that FLC concentrations are increased in
   serum and BAL fluid of IPF and HP patients and that FLCs are present
   within affected lung tissue. This suggests that FLCs may be involved in
   mediating pathology in both diseases.},

Journal = {IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},
Pages = {668-675},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this work, a simple off-line identification algorithm for an
   induction motor (IM) is presented, which is based on an optimisation
   scheme without derivatives, called edge optimisation. The main idea of
   this identification scheme is to convert the problem of parameters
   characterisation to a finite-dimensional optimisation problem over a
   bounded set. The proposed approach relies on the information of a hard
   or soft startup of the motor, in order to identify all seven IM
   parameters: stator and rotor leakage inductances, stator and rotor
   resistances, mutual inductance, mechanical inertia and friction
   coefficient. Thus, the edge optimisation considers an iterative
   approximation in order to obtain a convergent sequence to the optimal
   parameters. This strategy is compared with an stochastic search
   algorithm and particle filter optimisation. Experimental results on a 1
   and 3 HP IM test-rigs show an accurate characterisation with the
   proposed identification scheme, and validate the approach illustrated in
   this work.},

Abstract = {Arid mangroves constitute a particular biotope, with very extreme
   variations in ecological conditions, mainly temperature and salinity,
   condition that demand specific adaptations to successfully inhabit this
   ecosystem. Cyanoprokaryotes have not been well studied in Mexican coasts
   and this is the first study that contributes to the knowledge of the
   biodiversity of this group in an arid mangrove in Zacatecas estuary,
   Baja California Sur, Mexico. Samples of Avicennia germinans
   pneumatophores from Zacatecas estuary were collected between May 2005
   and May 2006. The identification of the most representative
   Chroococcales produced 10 morphotypes, described morphologically and
   digitally registered for the first time for Mexico. We report species of
   Aphanocapsa, Chroococcies, Hydrococcus, Chamaecalyx, Dermocarpella and
   Xenococcus. Some taxa have been recorded in brackish or even marine
   environments from other regions, evidencing the wide geographical
   distribution and ecological adaptability of these organisms, but some
   others are probably new to science. Some species have a specific
   seasonal and vertical distribution on the pneumatophore but other have a
   more ample distribution. Aphanocapsa littoralis and Chroococcus cf.
   obliteratus are new records for benthic biotopes of Pacific Mexico;
   Dermocarpella cf. stellata is a new record for the Gulf of California.},

   dimensions of 70 nm in diameter and 37 microns in depth (nanotubes) were

   fullerene compounds. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were
   performed on the hybrid samples in order to explore surface morphology
   and optimal insertion of these molecular systems into the AAM
   environment. The cubic nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, such as
   nonlinear refraction and absorption of the hybrid samples were studied
   via the Z-Scan technique in order to evaluate their NLO-performance.
   Hybrid AAM with fullerene compounds have shown outstanding NLO-activity

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to apply an experimental response surface
   methodology (RSM) to optimization of the Acid Yellow 36 (Ay 36)
   decolorization procedure the electro-Fenton process (EFP) using
   boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. RSM was used for the evaluation of
   different operation parameters, process modelling, optimization study,
   and model prediction analysis. Optimization of the electro-Fenton
   process for decolorization of 60 mg L-1 of synthetic azo dye solution
   was analyzed using a central composite design (CCD) in RSM. The response
   variable for the experimental design was a percentage of the color
   removal. The three considered factors, at two different levels, were
   current density (j=8 and 23 mA/cm(2)), catalytic Fe2+ concentrations
   (0.1 and 0.3 mmol L-1), and electrolysis time (10 and 50 min). According
   to RSM, the optimum operation conditions were Fe2+ = 0.24 mmol L-1, j=23

Abstract = {Crassostrea virginica is an epibentic filter-feeding bivalve of
   economical importance in coastal lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico,
   locations with increasing inputs of heavy metals such as cadmium that
   have become environmental stressors. In this study, feeding and
   assimilation of the species were evaluated as physiological indicators
   of cadmium exposure. For this purpose, the filtration rate (FR), food
   assimilation (A) and assimilation efficiency (AE) of oysters from the
   Mandinga Lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico, were examined under sublethal and
   environmentally realistic cadmium concentrations (95 and 170 mu gCd
   L-1). Semi-static, 12-day bioassays were conducted with organisms placed
   into individual chambers and fed daily with Tetraselmis suecica. FRwas
   calculated by measuring the depletion in algal density. Caloric contents
   of food and feces produced were also obtained. Condition Index (CI) and
   morphometric parameters were evaluated at the beginning and at the end
   of the assay. Total cadmium concentrations were quantified in water and
   tissue, and the metal bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated.
   Cadmium exposure significantly reduced FR in oysters (mean value: 0.64 L
   h(-1) and 0.44 L h(-1)) from control values (1.17 L h(-1)). Extreme
   values among results demonstrate the existence of a high FR (over 4 L
   h(-1)) mainly in control oysters, and this was associated with a better
   physiological condition; a low FR (under 2.5 L h(-1)) indicated
   metabolic stress as a consequence of Cd exposure. A and AE were
   significantly modified due to cadmium external levels, and time of
   exposure. FR and A were linearly related, and both decreased as metal
   BCF increased. Cadmium bioaccumulation was linearly related with
   external metal levels. The physiological deterioration of native C.
   virginica from Mandinga Lagoon was reflected in the alteration of FR, A
   and AE due to cadmium exposure in concentrations considered sublethal,
   lowering the feeding and assimilation capability of the organisms. The
   weight loss and mortality recorded in the oysters exposed to the highest
   metal concentration, was the final consequence of the overall adverse
   effect of cadmium exposure.},

   quantitative predictions on the effect of relaxing the sanitary measures
   after a period of control. We show how the sanitary measures reduced the
   maximal prevalence of the infected population from 10\% to less than 6\%
   of the total population. We also show how the model predicts the time of
   maximal prevalence and explains the effect of the control measures.},

Abstract = {We studied the alterations of dying oocytes in 1-28 days old rats using
   TUNEL method, immunolocalizations of active caspase 3, lamp1,
   localization of acid phosphatase, and DAPI staining. All procedures were
   performed in adjacent sections of each oocyte. In most dying oocytes
   exist simultaneously features of apoptosis as active caspase 3 and DNA
   breaks, and a large increase of lamp1 and acid phosphatase
   characteristic of autophagy. Large clumps of compact chromatin and
   membrane blebbing were absent. Electron microscope observations
   demonstrated the presence of small clear vesicles and
   autophagolysosomes. All these features indicate that a large number of
   oocytes are eliminated by a process sharing features of apoptosis and
   autophagy. In dying oocytes of new born rats the markers of apoptosis
   predominate over those of autophagy. However, fragmentation and
   apoptotic bodies were not found. These features suggest that in
   different cytophysiological conditions the processes of cell death may
   be differently modulated.},

Title = {Interaction of shockwaves with infected kidney stones:: Is there a

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1629-1637},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Many calculi contain bacteria, which can remain
   active inside kidney stones and cause infection after lithotripsy.
   Reduction in renal infections after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy
   has been observed; however, results are controversial, and no
   information on the effect of shockwaves on bacteria inside kidney stones
   has been reported. The purpose of this research was to study whether
   bacteria inside kidney stones can be inactivated by shockwaves.
   Materials and Methods: A series of infected artificial kidney stones
   were exposed in vitro to either 90 or 400 shockwaves using a research
   electrohydraulic or a commercial piezoelectric lithotripter. Two types
   of stones (soft and hard) were manufactured by mixing gypsum cement and
   Vel-mix-stone with water. Half of the stones were inoculated with
   Salmonella typhimurium. The suspension containing stone powder and
   bacteria was inoculated on agar plates and incubated. Bactericidal
   action was defined as the logarithmic viability reduction.
   Results: About 95\% of the bacteria were inactivated with 400 shockwaves
   using the electrohydraulic lithotripter; however, most of the damage was
   associated with the electromagnetic emission (ultraviolet radiation and
   visible light) generated at the spark gap. After 2730 shockwaves to
   stones placed inside a black polypropylene bag, about 29\% and 14\% of
   all bacteria were inactivated with the piezoelectric and the
   electrohydraulic lithotripter, respectively. In this case, the
   electromagnetic radiation was blocked by the black bag.
   Conclusions: Bacteria inactivation is possible by in vitro shockwave
   application; however, according to our results, no significant
   bactericidal effect is expected during extracorporeal shockwave
   lithotripsy.},

Abstract = {Bacteria that establish an obligate intracellular relationship with
   eukaryotic hosts undergo an evolutionary genomic reductive process.
   Recent studies have shown an increase in the number of mobile elements
   in the first stage of the adaptive process towards intracellular life,
   although these elements are absent in ancient endosymbionts. Here, the
   genome of SOPE, the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont of rice weevils,
   was used as a model to analyze the initial events that occur after
   symbiotic integration. During the first phases of the SOPE genome
   project, four different types of insertion sequence (IS) elements,
   belonging to well-characterized IS families from gamma-proteobacteria,
   were identified. In the present study, these elements, which may
   represent more than 20\% of the complete genome, were completely
   characterized; their relevance as a source of gene inactivation,
   chromosomal rearrangements, and as participants in the genome reductive
   process are discussed herein.},

Abstract = {The study of spatial variability in the chemical and physical properties
   of topsoil horizons of southern chernozems and chestnut soils at
   characteristic distances of less than 150, 150-800, and 800-2000 m
   proved that the spatial distribution of the studied properties is
   different for these two soils. In the southern chernozems, the maximum
   variability at short (< 150 m) distances was observed for the organic
   carbon content and pH values. The contents of clay (< 0.001 mm) and
   physical clay (< 0.01 mm) fractions and the content of total nitrogen
   displayed the maximum variability at distances of 150-800 m. At
   distances of > 800 m, the distribution of all the studied properties was
   characterized by quasiperiodicity. In the chestnut soils, the maximum
   variability in the contents of the clay, physical clay, and total
   nitrogen was observed at short distances, whereas the variability of the
   organic carbon content and pH values was maximum at distances of 150-800
   m. At the distances of 800-2000 m, only the variability in the clay
   fraction content followed a quasiperiodic pattern.},

Abstract = {Preliminary gravity results for the Mamfe Basin in the border region of
   northwestern Cameroon with southeastern Nigeria are reported. No
   geophysical studies were available for this important area, which is
   genetically related to oil and gas deposits in the Benue Trough.
   Regional and residual gravity components were obtained by least-square
   fitting of a third-degree polynomial surface to the Bouguer anomaly. The
   residual anomalies feature two NE-SW gravity lows attributed to
   sedimentary infill about the localities of Ekok and Agbokem, and about
   Mukonyong, Mamfe and Bachuo Akagbe. The gravity highs to the north and
   south are associated with outcrops of the basement complex. This
   structure corresponds to two major basins separated by a structural
   high. The deeper western sub-basin comprises two sub-basins separated by
   a minor structural high possibly related to the crystalline basement.
   These sub-basins tend to be shallower in the eastern direction possibly
   indicating the direction of migration of hydrocarbons. More detailed
   gravity and seismic studies may lead to discoveries of structural or
   stratigraphic traps. We conclude that the area is a promising prospect
   in terms of oil and gas prospecting.},

Abstract = {A hierarchical representation of objects is dynamically generated from
   the input of a virtual vision system. It is used to analyze a sequence
   of actions and extract behavior rules that can be utilized by the
   inference machine CLIPS. The vision system is assumed to provide
   simplified positional and shape information about visible 3D silhouettes
   in a frame per frame basis. A virtual agent, attempts to keep track of
   every image, without any previous knowledge about the object it
   represents. The hierarchy is restructured as necessary, to include new
   perceived images, in such a way that it also reflects factual
   relationships amongst them. Modifications between consecutive frames are
   internally interpreted and represented as functions which take the
   original world description and transform it into the next frame. A
   partial order is defined while looking for the satisfaction of
   domain/codomain requirements in functions composition, thus leading to
   the CLIPS rules.},

Title = {Serotonin concentration, synthesis, cell origin, and targets in the rat

Abstract = {The caput epididymis of some mammals contains large quantities of
   serotonin whose origin, targets, and physiological variations have been
   poorly studied. We combined morphological and biochemical techniques to
   begin approaching these aspects of serotonin in the rat caput
   epididymis. Serotonin immunostaining was detected in mast, epithelial,
   and neuroendocrine cells. Epithelial cells displayed immunoreactivity to
   5HT(1A), 5HT(2A), and 5HT(3) serotonin receptors. Endothelial and mast
   cells labeled positive for 5HT(1B) serotonin receptors and spermatozoa
   displayed 5HT2A and 5HT3 serotonin receptor immunoreactivity.
   Epithelial, endothelial, and mast cells stained positive for serotonin
   transporters. Only epithelial cells showed tryptophan hydroxylase
   immunoreactivity; this enzyme catalyzes the limiting step in the
   serotonin synthetic pathway. In addition, Western blot analyses of caput
   homogenates documented the presence of 2 protein bands (approximate to
   51 kd and 48 kd) that were immunoreactive for tryptophan hydroxylase.
   Chromatographic analyses documented the presence of tryptophan
   hydroxylase in the caput, and showed that both its activity and
   serotonin availability increased with sexual maturation and decreased
   following p-chlorophenylalanine treatment, an inhibitor of tryptophan
   hydroxylase activity. Interestingly, serotonin concentration and
   tryptophan hydroxylase activity tended to be higher in breeding males
   than in those with no mating experience. We think that these results
   support the existence of a local serotoninergic system in the rat caput
   epididymis that might regulate some aspects of male reproductive
   function.},

Title = {Ecology and morphological characterization of gametophyte and

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The morphology and phenology of Sirodotia huillensis was evaluated
   seasonally in a central Mexican first-order calcareous stream. Water
   temperature was constant (24-25 degrees C) and pH circumneutral to
   alkaline (6.7-7.9), and calcium and sulfates were the dominant ions. The
   gametophyte stages were characterized by the presence of a distinctive
   mucilaginous layer, a marked difference in phycocyanin to phycoerythrin
   ratio between female and male plants, and the presence of a carpogonia
   with a large trichogyne (> 60 mu m). Occasionally three capogonia were
   observed on a single basal cell. The `Chantransia' stages were
   morphologically similar to those described for the other members of
   Batrachospermales. A remarkable observation was the formation of
   dome-shaped structures, consisting of prostrate filaments that are
   related with the development of new gametophytes. Chromosome numbers
   were n = 4 for fascicle cells, cortical filament cells and dome-shaped
   cells, and 2n = 8 for gonimoblast filament cells and `Chantransia' stage
   filaments. Gametophytes and `Chantransia' stages occurred in fast
   current velocities (60-170 cm/s) and shaded (33.1-121 mu mol
   photons/m(2)/s) stream segments. The population fluctuated throughout
   the study period in terms of percentage cover and frequency: the
   `Chantransia' stages were most abundant in the rainy season, whereas
   gametophytic plants had the highest frequency values during the dry
   season. These results were most likely a result of fluctuations in
   rainfall and related changes in current velocity. Some characteristics
   of this population can be viewed as probable adaptations to high current
   velocities: the mucilaginous layer around plants that reduces drag;
   potential increase in fertilization by the elongate and plentiful
   trichogynes and abundant dome-shaped structures producing several
   gametophytes.},

Journal = {APOPTOSIS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The process of cell death of oocytes was studied in atretic ovarian
   follicles of rats aged from 1 to 28 days using light and electron
   microscope and cytochemical methods. These methods were TUNEL procedure
   for DNA breaks, active caspase-3 and lysosome-associated membrane
   protein 1 (LAMP-1) immunolocalizations. The structural features of the
   process of oocyte death are mainly characterized by the presence of
   abundant clear vacuoles and autophagosomes, as well as by the absence of
   large clumps of compact chromatin associated to the nuclear envelope and
   apoptotic bodies. These features are common to oocytes in all types of
   follicles studied. Cytochemical features consisting in positive
   reactions to TUNEL method, active caspase-3 and LAMP-1
   immunolocalizations, are common to the cell death of oocytes in all
   types of follicles. Particular features of the process of cell death of
   oocytes are found in different types of follicles. Two morphological
   patterns of cell death occur in pre-follicular oocytes of the new born
   and in primordial follicles in 1 to 5 days old rats. One is
   distinguished by clear nucleoli and moderate compaction of chromatin in
   clumps frequently resembling meiotic bivalents. The second pattern is
   characterized by nucleolar condensation and by the absence of compact
   chromatin. The process of cell death of oocytes in antral follicles is
   characterized by ribonucleoprotein ribbon-like cytoplasmic structures,
   pseudo-segmentation, and loss of contact with granulosa cells.},

Abstract = {An experiment on Web-assisted detection and correction of malapropism is
   reported. Malapropos words semantically destroy collocations they are
   in, usually with retention of syntactical links with other words. A
   hundred English malapropisms were gathered, each supplied with its
   correction candidates, i.e. word combinations with one word equal to an
   editing variant of the corresponding word in the malapropism. Google
   statistics of occurrences and co-occurrences were gathered for each
   malapropism and correcting candidate. The collocation components may be
   adjacent or separated by other words in a sentence, so statistics were
   accumulated for the most probable distance between them. The raw Google
   occurrence statistics are then recalculated to numeric values of a
   specially defined Semantic Compatibility Index (SCI). Heuristic rules
   are proposed to signal malapropisms when SCI values are lower than a
   predetermined threshold and to retain a few highly SCI-ranked correction
   candidates. Within certain limitations, the experiment gave promising
   results.},

Abstract = {Malapropisms are real-word errors that lead to syntactically correct but
   semantically implausible text. We report an experiment on detection and
   correction of Spanish malapropisms. Malapropos words semantically
   destroy collocations (syntactically connected word pairs) they are in.
   Thus we detect possible malapropisms as words that do not form
   semantically plausible collocations with neighboring words. As
   correction candidates, we select words similar to the suspected one but
   forming plausible collocations with neighboring words. To judge semantic
   plausibility of a collocation, we use Google statistics of occurrences
   of the word combination and of the two words taken apart. Since
   collocation components can be separated by other words in a sentence,
   Google statistics is gathered for the most probable distance between
   them. The statistics is recalculated to a specially defined Semantic
   Compatibility Index (SCI). Heuristic rules are proposed to signal
   malapropisms when SCI values are lower than a predetermined threshold
   and to retain a few highly SCI-ranked correction candidates. Our

Abstract = {Study objectives: To measure surfactant protein-A (SP-A) in the BAL of
   patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
   Design: We examined SP-A in BAL and lung tissue of patients with IPF who
   met the stricter recommended criteria for IPF at the time of diagnosis
   and prior to the beginning of treatment.
   Patients: Twenty-six patients with IPF confirmed at biopsy and 22
   patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) were compared with 9
   normal volunteers.
   Interventions: All patients were subjected to pulmonary function
   testing, BAL, and lung biopsy prior to the beginning of treatment.
   Measurements and results: We measured SP-A in BAL fluids and performed
   SP-A immunohistochemistry on lung specimens. Lung tissues of patients
   with IPF showed extensive type II cell hyperplasia, usually containing
   greatly increased levels of immunoreactive SP-A. By enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay, we found a twofold increase over normal values in
   BAL SP-A without changes in total phospholipids. These data were in
   agreement with semiquantitative assessments of SP-A by protein
   immunoblotting and by Western blotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels.
   Patients with HP exhibited a threefold increase of BAL SP-A.
   Conclusions: The reasons for the difference between our results and
   previously published reports describing decreased SP-A levels in OF is
   not clear. It may relate to the stricter criteria for diagnosis, the
   absence of treatment prior to BAL, differences in the patient
   population, or to other methodologic differences.},

Abstract = {The formation of the XY body involves the compaction of the extended
   chromatin to form a mesh of fibrogranular structures. During this
   process the ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP), which were associated
   with the chromatin filaments progressively disappear. High resolution
   immunolocalization indicates that the mature XY body does not contain
   RNA polymerase II, hnRNPs, or snURNPs. Occasionally chromatin fibrils
   extend outside of the XY body. These fibrils are frequently associated
   with nascent RNP fibrils and granules indicating that not all the DNA of
   the sex chromosomes is transcriptionally inactive. However,
   transcription is located outside the sex body. The recombination protein
   Dmc1 is present in nodules associated with the unpaired chromosomal axes
   of the sex chromosomes located in the XY body. Cytochemical staining
   methods and in situ hybridization at electron microscopic level show
   that RNA is present in the unpaired chromosomal axes suggesting that the
   presence of RNA in the chromosomal axes and in forming synaptonernal
   complexes is related with the process of final pairing. The sex body and
   the nucleoli associated with it do not interweave and do not exchange
   RNA or DNA-containing filaments. These observations indicate that the
   spatial relation between these structures is just a close proximity,
   which is, however, very frequent.},

Abstract = {Observations were made as to the influence of auxins, as the sole
   exogenous growth regulator, on the morphogenesis of long-term in vitro
   subcultured plantlets of the severely endangered cacti Mammillaria
   san-angelensis. Sections of long-term subcultured shoots were exposed to
   different auxins at various concentrations, and plant regeneration was
   recorded as a direct effect of auxin concentration. It was found that
   morphogenetic potentiality was retained in long-term subcultures, and
   that the best regeneration was seen in the presence of IAA (34.25 muM).
   Histological analysis revealed two processes leading to regeneration: de
   novo production of shoots and axillary meristem activation. Of the two,
   de novo shoot production was found to occur both in controls and in
   explants growing in the presence of IAA, while axillary meristem
   activation was observed only in the presence of IAA. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Lacandonia schismatica is a rare flowering plant with the sex organs
   spatially inverted. Several aspects of its cell biology are now known.
   Interestingly, within the cell nucleus, the chromatin is reticulated and
   it is associated to a novel structure named Lacandonia granules, a very
   abundant ribonucleoprotein particle showing similarities to
   perichromatin and Balbiani ring granules, which are involved in nuclear
   mRNA metabolism. To see whether these particles are present in other
   plants, we study the nucleus of Ginkgo biloba, a non-flowering plant.
   Light, electron and atomic force microscopy show that the cell nuclei of
   G. biloba are reticulated. Ultrastructural analysis showed that in the
   nucleoplasm, abundant intranuclear particles 32 nm in diameter are
   present. The EDTA regressive staining suggested that they contain RNA.
   Ultrastructural in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of RNA in
   these particles. Therefore, we conclude that the nuclei of G. biloba are
   reticulated and contain Lacandonia granules. We suggest that these
   particles may also be present in other plants. (C) 2002 Editions

   depends on the densities of both species. We use a model consisting of
   two coupled nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with
   density-dependent diffusion terms and space-dependent
   Lotka-Volterra-like competing interaction terms. The model is analyzed
   by using a mixture of phase-plane analysis and numerical simulations.
   Results show that competition and dispersal can lead to completely
   segregated species ranges. Spatial variation favored and provided
   stability to parapatric distribution. Parapatry occurred under several
   conditions, including when both species were identical in dispersal,
   intrinsic rate of growth, and competition but differed in their spatial
   performances. Results indicate that overlapping distributions and
   parapatry are equally expected for close species. Moreover, similar
   species in parapatry tend to exhibit equivalent range sizes. This model
   explains how species can coexist regionally while maintaining spatial
   exclusion. It also describes how a species that is rare in distribution
   can invade the range of a similar and widespread species. We discuss the
   limitations of using present species distributions for recognizing modes
   of speciation, and we suggest studying more extensively the relationship
   between density-dependent dispersal and interspecific competition. We
   show that density-dependent dispersal can favor segregation.},

Abstract = {Non-nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, extended chromatin, and
   the distribution of very active sites of transcription are studied in a
   dinoflagellate symbiont of sea anemones. A preferential staining method
   for RNP demonstrates granules 47 +/- 10 nm (standard deviation) in
   diameter, partially surrounded by a clear halo, and fibres of different
   thickness. All these particles are sensitive to RNase. Phosphotungstic
   acid staining for chromatin shows loops of extended chromatin formed by
   filaments about 7.5 +/- 3 nm thick protruding from chromosomes. These
   filaments are sensitive to DNase. Short labelings with tritiated uridine
   demonstrate a thin perichromosomal region of high transcriptional
   activity, which may be the functional equivalent to the perichromatin
   region of higher eukaryotes. In contrast to the eukaryotic perichromatin
   region, the perichromosomal zone of dinoflagellates has no feature
   allowing its morphological characterization. A network of filaments 4
   +/- 2nm thick, resistant to RNase and to DNase, may be related to the
   nuclear matrix. A sheath of RNP nature is described at the periphery of
   chromosomes. It is suggested that this sheath is related to the ordered
   disposition of chromosomal fibres.},

Title = {Morphological and molecular data reveal a new genus and species from the
   family Transvenidae (Echinorhynchida: Palaeacanthocephala) from Bahia de
   Todos los Santos, Northeast Pacific, Mexico},
Journal = {PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {111},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Echinorhynchids are a group of globally distributed acanthocephalan
   parasites mainly of freshwater, brackish and marine fishes and
   occasionally, reptiles and amphibians. During several parasitology
   surveys in the Gulf of Mexico and Northeast Pacific, Mexico,
   acanthocephalans were recovered from two marine fish species. The
   specimens from the Gulf of Mexico were identified as Caballerorhynchus
   lamothei (Cavisomidae), a typical parasite of the striped mojarra,
   whereas adult acanthocephalans from the Northeast Pacific, Mexico, from
   the Garibaldi fish exhibited morphological characteristics belonging to
   the family Transvenidae. Sequences from the small (SSU) and large (LSU)
   subunits of ribosomal DNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) of
   mitochondrial DNA were obtained for both species. The new sequences were
   aligned with other sequences available in the GenBank dataset from
   Echinorhynchida. Phylogenetic trees inferred with the combined (SSU +
   LSU), concatenated (SSU + LSU+ cox 1), and cox 1 datasets consistently
   placed the two species into two independent lineages. The species C.
   lamothei from Cavisomidae was placed in a clade together with members
   from Spinulacorpidae, Rhadinorhynchidae and Transvenidae, suggesting
   that Cavisomidae is paraphyletic. The unidentified specimens were nested
   inside a clade formed by members of Transvenidae. Morphologically, the
   new samples presented a combination of unique diagnostic traits, which
   was not observed in other members of the Transvenidae family. Therefore,
   the genus Darwinorhynchus was created to accommodate a new species named
   herein as Darwinorhynchus bajacaliforniaensis n. gen., n. sp. The
   current record from a transvenid acanthocephalan expands its
   distribution range to the northern Pacific in the Americas, Indian Ocean
   and Arabian Gulf.},

Title = {The evolution of unavoidable bichromatic patterns and extremal cases of
   balanceability},
Journal = {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {349},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We study the color patterns that, for n sufficiently large, are
   unavoidable in 2-colorings of the edges of a complete graph K(n )with
   respect to min\{e(R),e(B)\}, where e(R) and e(B)are the numbers of red
   and blue edges, respectively. More precisely, we completely characterize
   which patterns are unavoidable depending on the order of magnitude of
   min\{e(R), e(B)\} (in terms of n), and show how these patterns evolve
   from the case without restriction in the coloring, namely that
   min\{e(R), e(B)\} >= 0 (given by Ramsey's theorem), to the highest
   possible restriction, namely that |e (R)-e(B)| <= 1. We also investigate
   the effect of forbidding certain substructures in each color. In
   particular, we show that, if the graphs induced by each of the colors
   are both free from an induced matching of a certain size, the patterns
   that were unavoidable with ohm(n(2-epsilon)) edges in each color are
   already granted when min\{e(R), e(B)\} is linear. Moreover, we analyze
   the consequences of these results on the balancing number bal(n, G) of a
   graph G (i.e. the minimum k such that every 2-edge coloring of K-n with
   min\{e(R),e(B)\} > k contains a copy of G with half the edges in each
   color), and show that, for every epsilon > 0, there are graphs G with
   bal(n, G) = ohm(n(2-epsilon)), which is the highest order of magnitude
   that is possible to achieve, as well as graphs where bal(n, G) <= c(G),
   where c(G) is a constant that depends only on G. We characterize the
   latter ones. We also extend the investigation of the effect of
   forbidding induced monochromatic matchings of a given size to the
   multicolor setting. (c) 2025 Elsevier B.V. All rights are reserved,

   nanocomposites for visible light photocatalytic degradation of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {Nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4, NFO)/cerium dioxide (CeO2) nanocomposites
   (NFCs) with varying ratios were synthesized by a hydrothermal route and
   tested as photocatalysts for oxytetracycline (OTC) degradation under
   visible light. Unlike conventional ferrite-ceria composites, this work
   introduces hierarchical flowerlike architectures with reduced
   crystallite sizes (approximate to 8.2 nm-10 nm) and an S-scheme
   (broken-gap) heterojunction that promotes efficient charge separation.
   Structural and spectroscopic analyses, including X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and ultraviolet-visible
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) confirmed strong
   interfacial coupling and defect-rich surfaces, enhancing redox activity.
   Among the samples, NFC4 achieved the highest degradation efficiency
   (84.72\%), while NFC1 exhibited the fastest kinetics (k = 0.0122
   min(-1)). Scavenger tests identified hydroxyl radicals ( <middle dot>
   OH) as the main active species, synergistically assisted by Fe3+/Fe(2+
   )and Ni3+/Ni(2+ )redox cycling through a photo-Fenton-like pathway. The
   composites showed high stability, with NFC4 retaining >96\% activity
   after four reuse cycles. These findings highlight the novelty of
   designing hierarchical NFO/CeO2 nanocomposites as efficient, durable,
   and magnetically recoverable photocatalysts for the visible-light
   remediation of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants.},

Abstract = {In this work, we investigate the tunable plasmonic modes and optical
   conductivity of holey graphene (HG) by varying the radius and

   graphene's bipartite sublattice symmetry is the key physical mechanism,
   which simultaneously induces electronic flat bands and a strong optical
   anisotropy. The former gives rise to nearly flat plasmonic bands, while
   the latter enables the propagation of hyperbolic plasmons. These
   findings position holey graphene as a promising platform for
   nanophotonics, offering directional control of light at the nanoscale

Title = {Nitrogen-fixing bacterial inoculation: a meta-analysis of its effects on
   crop productivity and methodological considerations},
Journal = {COGENT FOOD \& AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) inoculation can enhance crop productivity
   and reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers. This meta-analysis of 80
   studies examined factors influencing NFB efficacy: crop-bacterial
   specificity, inoculation methods, and field-microcosm comparability.
   Using a random-effects model, we found a significant overall positive
   effect of NFB inoculation on crop yield (Hedges' g = 1.263, 95\% CI:
   1.159-1.367); however, substantial heterogeneity (I2=66.99\%) was
   observed across studies. Effectiveness varied significantly by
   crop-bacterial combination; for instance, Azospirillum boosted wheat
   (Hedges' g = 1.312) and maize, Rhizobium improved wheat yields (Hedges'
   g = 0.883), and Azotobacter significantly benefited chickpea (Hedges' g
   = 0.835), underscoring the need for targeted strategies. Soil
   inoculation demonstrated significantly greater positive effects than did
   seed inoculation. The advantages of soil inoculation were much more
   pronounced in field studies than in microcosms. In contrast, for seed
   inoculation, microcosm studies showed a significantly larger positive
   effect than did field studies. These findings indicate that while NFB
   inoculation is a promising approach for sustainable agriculture,
   optimizing its effectiveness requires careful consideration of
   crop-bacterial compatibility and inoculation methods. The larger effects
   observed for seed inoculation in microcosm settings compared to field
   trials suggest that the direct translation of these specific microcosm
   results to field performance requires caution.},

Title = {First-principles study of the adsorption of alkali atoms in PbC
   monolayers and their potential applications},
Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {714},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {Two-dimensional structures have attracted attention because the atoms
   can easily lose electrons and modify their physical properties. In
   particular, the binary compounds of group-IV carbides are ideal for
   energy storage, optical and magnetic devices. First-principles
   calculations were used to predict the structural and electronic
   properties of alkali atoms (Li, Na and K) adsorbed onto a PbC monolayer
   (M-PbC). Our results show that the alkaline adatom systems are more
   energetically stable than the pristine system. The increase in alkaline
   adatoms on M-PbC causes deformation in the monolayer, forming sp3 and
   sp3d hybridizations. The concentration of eight Li adatoms causes a
   metal-induced gap state and a semiconductor with an indirect gap of
   0.47(Na)/0.2 (K) eV. The activation barrier energies are 0.518 (Li),
   0.456 (Na), and 0.156 (K) eV and the average Open Circuit Voltage in the
   M-PbC for a 0.16 concentration are 2.26 (Li), 2.20 (Na) and 2.01 V (K)
   and for a 0.5 concentration the theoretical specific capacities are 427
   (Li), 398 (Na) and 374 mAh/g (K). These results indicate that M-PbC can
   be used as a cathode in Li, Na or K-ion batteries. Especially Li adatoms
   can be used for applications in high-performance single-layer
   transistors or optoelectronic integrated circuits, and Na and K for
   field emission devices or photovoltaic cells.},

Title = {Precipitation regimes influence differently the biogeochemical cycles of
   the tropical dry forest},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {375},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Tropical dry forests (TDFs), comprising similar to 40 \% of all tropical
   forests, are crucial for global biogeochemical cycling and a leading
   driver of global interannual variation in net carbon dioxide exchange.
   Their sensitivity to precipitation variability affects microbial
   activity, nutrient mineralization, and organic matter decomposition, yet
   their responses to environmental change remain insufficiently
   understood. This study evaluates how different precipitation
   regimes-annual precipitation, seasonal precipitation, and El Nino
   events-on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and
   phosphorus (P) in TDFs. Using long-term datasets on biogeochemistry and
   plant diversity (both taxonomic and functional), we isolated
   precipitation effects through a multi-ensemble approach. Our results
   highlight the role of plant biodiversity-soil interactions in shaping
   population, community, and ecosystem level responses. Annual
   precipitation emerged as a key driver of functional trait expression and
   C cycling. This resulted in a negative trend for most C and N metrics,
   while the ratio of soil basal respiration to microbial C showed a
   positive trend. Seasonal precipitation explained much of the variation
   in N cycling, with wet seasons linked to elevated N metrics and dry
   seasons associated with higher dissolved organic C and microbial
   biomass. Post-El Nino recovery of soil C and N required at least two
   years. While P cycling was influenced by annual precipitation, the
   effect was not significant. These findings advance our understanding of
   TDF vulnerability under climate change, emphasizing how changes in
   rainfall regimes may reshape biogeochemical processes. Notably, our
   results suggest that TDFs may shift from C sinks to sources under
   scenarios of intensified drought and incomplete ecosystem recovery after
   stronger and more frequent drought events.},

Title = {Phase control and optical response in NbNx ultra-thin films by reactive
   PLD},
Journal = {MICRO AND NANOSTRUCTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {208},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ultra-thin films of NbNx were synthesized by reactive PLD with the
   nitrogen partial pressure (pN(2)) set to 8, 12, 16, and 20 Pa to
   elucidate the effects of nitridation on phase composition and functional
   properties. The film thickness decreased from 68 nm to 32 nm as pN(2)
   increased. Grazingincidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and Scherrer
   analysis revealed a gradual transformation from mixed tetragonal
   gamma-NbN0.64 and hexagonal epsilon-NbN phases to a predominantly
   hexagonal epsilon-NbN phase with increasing pN(2), accompanied by a
   linear reduction in crystallite size from similar to 12 nm to similar to
   3.6 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed a very thin (similar to
   5 nm) oxide surface layer and a slight decrease in the N 1s-Nb 3d
   splitting, indicating enhanced Nb-N charge transfer, with very small
   amounts of oxide within the ultra-thin films. Raman spectroscopy
   exhibited up-shifts in first-order phonon modes alongside pronounced
   acoustic bands, confirming the films' polycrystalline nature. Finally,
   UV-Vis spectrophotometry demonstrated near-zero absorbance in the
   infrared region, suggesting strong IR reflectivity, which makes the
   films suitable for applications in coatings.},

Journal = {HARDWAREX},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Electrodes that measure the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) assess
   the relationship between oxidized and reduced substances that may exist
   in water disinfection processes. This work presents the implementation
   and characterization of an ORP measurement system using the Atlas
   Scientific ORP sensor, integrated with an Arduino R4 development board
   as the control and data transmission unit. The main objective is to
   develop an economical, fast, and reliable solution for the continuous
   monitoring of the bacteriological quality of water in a wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP). The system operates in real time, transmitting
   information to remote platforms. The manufacturing and integration
   stages of the system, as well as its calibration and experimental
   validation, are described. The results indicate that a properly
   calibrated sensor provides accurate measurements, making it a viable and
   cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory equipment or
   bacteriological analyses that require long processing times.
   Additionally, by monitoring the ORP variable in a WWTP, alerts can be
   generated for variations related to microbial load in the wastewater
   treatment process, enabling immediate corrective actions before
   discharge into surface water bodies.},

Abstract = {In this article I present and review some of the most relevant
   challenges that social disciplines have raised about medically assisted
   human reproduction. I accompanied this review from the perspective of
   hope to understand phenomena such as the medicalization of reproduction
   and the transformations in social order as a result of assisted
   reproduction techniques. I recover this emotion from Adri \& aacute;n
   Scribano's proposal (2023) to analyze hope in two senses. One of them
   has to do with how biomedicine commodifies the idea of reproduction and
   offers the hope of procreation. In a second sense, I think of hope as an
   emotion that users of these reproductive techniques construct to sustain
   their decision to become mothers. The discipline required to attend
   medical appointments, carry out the treatment indicated by the doctor,
   change eating habits, lifestyles, face family and social conflicts and
   emotional changes, among others, are examples of interstitial practices
   that allow us to observe and analyze the changes at the social,
   cultural, family composition and gender levels that are taking shape as
   a result of these techniques.},

Abstract = {Oxytetracycline (OTC) is an antibiotic characterized by its persistence,
   bioaccumulation, and low biodegradability, posing a significant risk to
   human health. In this study, the degradation of OTC under visible light
   was investigated considering the structural, morphological and
   photocatalytic performance of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles under different
   synthesis methods (mechanochemical, hydrothermal, sol-gel and solid
   state). The materials were characterized using XRD, XPS, SEM, BET, FT-IR
   spectra, UV-Vis, PL, and Raman spectroscopy to evaluate their
   crystallinity, particle size, elemental composition and oxidation
   states, bandgap, and surface properties. NiFe2O4 synthesized by the
   mechanochemical method exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency,
   achieving 84.57\% OTC degradation, attributed to its lower band gap
   (1.745 eV) and enhanced surface reactivity. In comparison, NiFe2O4
   produced by the sol-gel method also demonstrated high degradation
   efficiency, while the samples obtained via the hydrothermal and
   solid-state methods showed lower photocatalytic activity, attributed to
   their larger bandgaps and more significant particle agglomeration.
   Photocatalytic stability was evaluated over multiple reaction cycles,
   with the mechanochemically synthesized sample showing the highest
   stability. This study highlights the importance of synthesis methods in
   optimizing the photocatalytic properties of NiFe2O4, establishing it as
   a promising material for removing pharmaceutical contaminants from
   water.},

Abstract = {Let B denote the closed unit ball of Hilbert space l2 endowed with the
   standard involution sigma : x -{*} -x. It is proved that for every
   separable metrizable space (X, tau) with a based-free involution (i.e.,
   an involution that has a unique fixed point), the equivariant maps (X,
   tau)-{*} (B, sigma) separate points and closed sets in X. This is
   applied to give a direct proof of a result by the second two authors
   {[}10] that (l2, sigma) is universal for all based-free involutions. Two
   new characterizations of equivariant based-free compactifications are

Title = {Extra-legged flies and several other transgenerational developmental
   defects induced by environmentally relevant concentrations of
   N-nitrosodimethylamine in Drosophila melanogaster},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {385},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a ubiquitous disinfection byproduct
   (DBP) and a probable human carcinogen produced by reactions between
   organic nitrogen precursors and dichloramine. NDMA is the most
   frequently found nitrosamine in drinking water. It has been detected in
   food, pharmaceuticals, and effluent discharges from industries, posing a
   serious threat to ecological and human health. Although NDMA-induced
   toxicity has been well-studied in animal species, information on its
   long-term effects is scarce. This study aimed to comprehensively
   investigate the effects of NDMA exposure at environmentally relevant
   concentrations on Drosophila melanogaster development over four
   generations. Third-instar larvae were fed NDMA (88.3 ng/L-723.5 mu g/L)
   for 48 h and later emerged as adult flies (parental generation).
   Subsequent offspring (F1-F3) were grown under NDMAfree conditions.
   Deformed flies, predominantly females, were found in both the exposed
   and untreated generations. However, malformation rates were significant
   only in the F2 and F3 generations. The entire body of the fly was
   affected below 2826 ng/L NDMA, and most abnormalities occurred in the
   thoracic area, mainly in the legs. Surprisingly, eight-legged and
   seven-legged flies were detected in the F2 and F3 generations. The
   notable transgenerational developmental defects underscore the long-term
   toxicity of NDMA to D. melanogaster, suggesting that harmful effects can
   be transmitted to offspring when NDMA is removed. This study provides
   evidence that extra-legged organisms can stem from exposure to
   environmental pollutants.},

Abstract = {Pacific pygmy octopus Paroctopus digueti is a promising model for
   cephalopod research and aquaculture; its feeding and nutritional biology
   remain poorly understood. The anterior salivary glands (ASG), posterior
   salivary glands (PSG), and digestive gland (DG) are central to these
   processes, but molecular comparisons are lacking. To address this gap,
   we performed a transcriptomic study to explore the enzymatic repertoire
   and functional specialization of these tissues. Total RNA was extracted
   from ASG, PSG, and DG of three pre-adult individuals collected in La Paz
   Bay, Mexico. RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced, and a non-redundant
   multi-tissue transcriptome was assembled. The ASG displayed high
   expression of neuropeptides, playing a role in neuroendocrine
   regulation. The PSG showed elevated protease expression, supporting its
   function in extracellular digestion, alongside toxins that reinforce its
   role as a venom gland. The DG was enriched in proteins linked to
   biomolecule catabolism and antimicrobial peptides, alluding to metabolic
   specialization and immune defense. These results were validated by qPCR,
   and target genes were also amplified in Octopus maya and O. hubbsorum,
   showing some similarities in expression patterns. Overall, our findings
   suggest strong glandular specialization in P. digueti, providing
   insights into cephalopod digestive physiology and supporting its value
   as a model species.},

Title = {A spine for the decorated Teichmüller space of a punctured

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE LONDON MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Building on work of Harer, we construct a spine for the decorated Teichm
   \& uuml;ller space of a non-orientable surface with at least one
   puncture and negative Euler characteristic. We compute its dimension,
   and show that the deformation retraction onto this spine is equivariant
   with respect to the pure mapping class group of the non-orientable
   surface. As a consequence, we obtain a model for the classifying space
   for proper actions of the pure mapping class group of a punctured
   non-orientable surface, which is of minimal dimension in the case there
   is a single puncture.},

Title = {Quaternary History and Phylogeography of Three Hamadryas Butterflies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 3},
Abstract = {Aim Understanding the evolutionary processes shaping species
   distributions requires an integrative approach encompassing
   phylogeographic and biogeographic perspectives. Hamadryas butterflies
   represent a good model for such research, due to their widely studied
   ecological and evolutionary characteristics and the availability of
   detailed data on their distribution and taxonomy. This study
   investigates the drivers of diversification in Hamadryas julitta, H.
   glauconome glauconome, and H. glauconome grisea, assessing the roles of
   geographic barriers and Pleistocene climatic fluctuations across
   Mesoamerica.Location Mesoamerica.Taxon Hamadryas glauconome glauconome,
   Hamadryas glauconome grisea, and Hamadryas julitta.Methods An analysis
   was conducted on mitochondrial DNA (COI) from populations across Mexico
   and Central America. Evolutionary patterns were reconstructed using
   haplotype networks, phylogenies, and divergence time estimates. The
   assessment of demographic changes was conducted through the utilization
   of Fu's Fs, Tajima's D, and mismatch distributions, alongside
   biogeographic interpretations of geological and climatic events.Results
   Our analyses revealed three genetically distinct lineages with no shared
   haplotypes, supporting their status as separate evolutionary units.
   Divergence between H. julitta and H. glauconome dates to approximately
   3.1 Ma, associated with the uplift of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and
   Maya Mountains, isolating H. julitta within the Yucat \& aacute;n
   Peninsula. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt appears to have shaped the
   distribution of H. g. glauconome. Demographic patterns suggest a
   post-glacial expansion in H. g. glauconome, while H. g. grisea shows
   high haplotype diversity without evidence of recent expansion,
   indicating long-term isolation. Divergence between H. g. glauconome and
   H. g. grisea around 1.7 Ma coincides with Pleistocene climatic shifts,
   and historical marine transgressions may have reinforced isolation in H.
   julitta.Main Conclusions This study highlights the crucial role of
   geographic barriers, marine transgressions, and Pleistocene climatic
   changes in shaping butterfly diversification in Mesoamerica. The
   patterns observed emphasize the dynamic history of the region and its
   importance in promoting genetic differentiation. Further genomic,
   ecological, and morphological studies will be essential to fully unravel
   the evolutionary history of Hamadryas butterflies.},

Abstract = {This study examines the interaction of CO and O2 with a lithium, sodium,
   and potassium decorated and pristine silicon carbide monolayers (SiCML)
   using the first principles density functional theory. The pristine SiCML
   shows the capacity to adsorb both CO and O2, with higher adsorption
   energies for the O2, which dissociates on the surface of the ML with the
   two O being adsorbed in two equivalent adjacent bridge sites. The
   results show that the decoration is stable even at room temperature,
   with the main adsorption sites for the decoration being on top of Si
   atoms. The decoration generally improves the adsorption energy of both
   molecules, with the exception of the K-decorated SiCML with adsorbed O2,
   which creates potassium superoxide that dissociates from the SiCML. The
   decoration also alters more significantly the electronic band structures
   by creating some localized states in the band gap that could be used for
   detection by either electrical or optical means. Chemical reactivity
   indices indicate that upon adsorption, the surfaces will be receptive to
   nucleophilic attacks, which opens the possibility of the adsorption of
   other molecules or radicals on the surface of the ML.},

Title = {Using monoids for the integration of genomic and metabolic parameters in
   the prediction of phenotypes in regulatory cascades},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {257},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Molecular network modeling requires the use of mathematical and
   computational formalisms for a robust and accurate prediction of
   phenotypes. Furthermore, there is a need to extend these formalisms to
   be applied to large-scale molecular networks, thus helping in the
   understanding of biological complexity. In this work, we propose an
   extension of the modeling framework known as design principles,
   developed by M.A. Savageau, which is based on power-law modeling. While
   power-law modeling has proven valuable for understanding various
   properties of molecular networks, it does not allow for the inference of
   kinetic orders, which are typically associated with the number of
   binding sites present in molecules. We address this limitation by
   modifying the traditional approach to incorporate the use of monoids,
   thereby introducing a novel methodological framework we call Genotype
   Arithmetic. The resulting combinatorial object defines a family of
   geometric points, whose fixed points in the exponent space impose a set
   of constraints that determine the appropriate kinetic order to be used
   in the power law models. This feature enables a prediction of the
   binding strength and/or the number of DNA binding sites in regulatory
   sequences, as well as the reaction orders in enzymatic kinetics. To
   demonstrate the applicability of the present approach, we illustrated
   how the number of binding sites can be approximated in metabolic
   pathways formed by 3 to 9 reactions, in allosteric systems of
   end-product inhibition with intermediate catalytic reactions and one
   gene inhibition.},

Title = {Habitat use and morphological evolution in Sceloporus: a single- and

Abstract = {Analyses of body shape and its relationship to habitat use are essential
   to understanding the process of biological adaptation. Habitat use is
   one of the main factors influencing body shape variation in lizards,
   resulting in a wide range of morphological responses to different
   selection pressures associated with locomotion across diverse
   substrates. In this study, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of
   eight morphological traits (derived from 11 measured traits after
   averaging left-right pairs) across 79 species of the genus Sceloporus.
   Using a suite of phylogenetic comparative methods, we tested whether
   habitat use drives morphological differentiation independently of
   phylogenetic relatedness. Our results indicate that although Sceloporus
   shows dynamic morphological evolution associated with habitat use, this
   pattern is not clear when multiple traits are analysed simultaneously.
   However, trait-specific analyses revealed associations between habitat
   type and traits such as head width and snout-vent length. These findings
   suggest that morphological similarity among species occupying similar
   environments might result from adaptive responses to habitat use,
   regardless of phylogenetic history. We discuss potential selective
   pressures and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these patterns of
   morphological evolution in Sceloporus.},

Title = {Historical biogeography and climatic niche dynamics in spiny lizards of
   the genus Sceloporus (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae)},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {146},
Number = {3},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although we now have extensive biogeographical datasets for tetrapods,
   unravelling the drivers of species' distributions remains challenging,
   especially for many squamate groups. Spiny lizards of the genus
   Sceloporus exemplify this knowledge gap as their geographical origin has
   been the topic of long-standing debates. In addition, we lack
   information about the historical dispersal and the evolutionary dynamics
   of the responses to climate of this genus. To help fill these gaps, we
   used an approach that combined phylogenetic regionalization, ancestral
   range estimation, age-range correlation, and trait evolution analyses.
   Our results indicate that Sceloporus likely originated from a wide
   region spanning tropical and temperate climates of North and Central
   America, followed by speciation in sympatry at the bioregional level.
   However, patterns of geographical overlap among clades suggest the
   potential role of both sympatric and allopatric processes. We also found
   indications that interregional dispersal events are decoupled from
   evolutionary shifts in niche breadth and position, suggesting
   long-distance dispersal under niche conservatism. Together, these
   findings point to local extinctions and interregional dispersal as key
   forces structuring current Sceloporus distributions at the bioregional
   level and more broadly underscore the importance of integrating
   ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographical factors to better
   understand what shapes species' distributions.},

   properties defined via dense subspaces},
Journal = {TOPOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {373},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {We study several compactness-like properties arising from the existence
   of dense subspaces satisfying relative compactness conditions, namely:
   countably pracompact, totally countably pracompact, densely
   omega-bounded, and sequentially pracompact spaces. These classes refine
   classical notions such as sequential compactness and omega-boundedness
   and admit a natural hierarchy. We establish various preservation results
   for these properties under perfect open mappings and product spaces. In
   the context of topological groups, we prove that if His a locally
   compact subgroup of a topological group G, then the corresponding
   quotient mapping pi : G -> G/H allows the transfer of local versions of
   these properties from G/H to G. We also analyze the extent to which
   these properties satisfy the three-space property and introduce the
   class of PC-spaces to characterize when such transfer is possible.
   Finally, we address structural questions on densely omega-bounded
   paratopological groups and provide conditions under which they are
   topological. (c) 2025 Elsevier B.V. All rights are reserved, including

Title = {Ecological Impacts of Land-use and Land-Cover Change in a Tropical
   Karst: The Río Grande de Comitán Basin, Mexico (1974-2025)},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 1},
Abstract = {This study analyzes land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) in the R \&
   iacute;o Grande de Comit \& aacute;n Basin (RGCB), Chiapas, Mexico, from
   1974 to 2025, using Landsat satellite imagery and supervised
   classification techniques. Over the past 50 years, the RGCB has
   undergone a significant transformation: forest cover declined by 23.5\%,
   while agricultural land remained the dominant land use, peaking in 1999.
   Urban settlements expanded rapidly, particularly around Comit \&
   aacute;n de Dom \& iacute;nguez city, contributing to the loss of
   natural vegetation and increased landscape fragmentation. The Montebello
   lakes, a karstic system located in the southeastern part of the basin,
   have been significantly affected by these changes. Plateau lakes, which
   are hydrologically connected to the Grande de Comit \& aacute;n River
   and surrounded by agricultural and urban land, have undergone
   progressive eutrophication since the 1990s. In contrast, mountain lakes
   remain oligotrophic due to their surface isolation and surrounding
   forest cover. Our findings highlight the spatial and temporal dynamics
   of LULCC and their ecological consequences in a tropical karst
   watershed. The results underscore the need for inte-grated land-use
   planning, improved wastewater management, and conservation strategies to
   protect the region's vulnerable aquatic ecosystems. Graphical Abstract
   This study investigates land use and land cover change (LULCC) in the
   Rio Grande de Comit \& aacute;n Basin (RGCB), Chiapas, Mexico, from 1974
   to 2025. A karstic lake district with more than 130 water bodies is
   situated in the lower southeastern part of the RGCB. Using Landsat
   imagery from five decades, we tracked LULCC dynamics through supervised
   classifica-tion based on a maximum likelihood algorithm, validated with
   field data and official land use maps. Our results showed a continued
   increase in agricultural land and urban areas, which covered 64.6\% of
   the total basin at the expense of forest cover, which declined by 23.5\%
   over the study period. In the early 1990s, the lakes on the NW plateau
   became eutrophic, while the lakes in the SE mountainous region have
   remained oligotrophic. Our findings indicate that the change in LULCC
   has led to the trophic degradation of the Montebello lakes, mainly due
   to nutrient-rich runoff from agricultural land and poor wastewater
   management treatment. These changes are closely connected to historical
   land reforms, population growth, and economic pressures. This study
   emphasizes the importance of integrating basin-wide remote sensing for
   long-term environ-mental assessments and the potential impacts on
   aquatic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {We present the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
   Observatory) Visual Morphology (MVM) catalogue, featuring a visual
   morphological classification of 10 059 galaxies in the final MaNGA
   sample. By combining SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and DESI (Dark
   Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we
   classified galaxies into 13 Hubble types, detected tidal features,
   categorized bars into different families, and estimated concentration,
   asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of the DLS images allowed us to
   identify structural details that were not evident in the SDSS images,
   resulting in a more reliable classification. After correcting for volume
   completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy morphology, with
   peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa types.
   Bars are present in 54 per cent of disc galaxies with inclinations
   \$\textbackslash{}lt 70<\^{}>\textbackslash{}circ\$, following a bimodal
   trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal structures are
   identified in \$\textbackslash{}sim\$13 per cent of galaxies,
   particularly in massive E-Sa and low-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive
   the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and decompose it into each
   morphological type. Schechter functions accurately describe the latter,
   while a triple Schechter function describes the total GSMF, associating
   three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The abundance
   of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are
   predominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are
   generally younger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich
   compared to early-type galaxies. Additionally, we find evidence
   connecting morphology and stellar mass to the star formation history of
   galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust data set for investigating
   galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine learning-based
   morphological classifications.},

Abstract = {N-pentanol is a viable biofuel due to its capability to reduce pollutant
   emissions and its compatibility with both conventional internal
   combustion engines and advanced combustion strategies such as
   low-temperature combustion (LTC). This work presents a reduced kinetic
   mechanism for n-pentanol combustion, consisting of 66 species and 292
   reactions, capable of modeling high- and low-temperature ignition, flame
   propagation, and heat release dynamics. The mechanism was developed
   using a validated methodology that integrates an n-pentanol submechanism
   into the San Diego base mechanism and applies a systematic reduction
   approach, including sensitivity analysis and steady-state approximation
   criteria. The reduced model accurately captures key combustion features,
   including negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior and
   low-temperature heat release in the 600-1000 K range. Validation against
   experimental data, such as ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds,
   and speciation measurements in a jet-stirred reactor, demonstrates high
   predictive capability across a wide range of conditions. A key
   contribution of this work is the introduction of a mathematical model to
   estimate the maximum temperature attained under low-temperature
   conditions, offering new insights into the heat release mechanisms that
   govern the thermal transition in this regime and their role in shaping
   the NTC phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Myxococcus xanthus is a unicellular organism known for its capacity to
   move and communicate, giving rise to complex collective properties,
   structures and behaviors. These characteristics have contributed to
   position M. xanthus as a valuable model organism for exploring emergent
   collective phenomena at the interface of biology and physics,
   particularly within the growing domain of active matter research. Yet,
   researchers frequently encounter difficulties in establishing
   reproducible and reliable culturing protocols. This tutorial provides a
   detailed and accessible guide to the culture, growth, development, and
   experimental sample preparation of M. xanthus. In addition, it presents
   several exemplary experiments that can be conducted using these samples,
   including motility assays, fruiting body formation, predation, and
   elasticotaxis-phenomena of direct relevance for active matter studies.},

Title = {The protective effects of selenium against NLRP3-mediated inflammation
   and pyroptosis: mechanisms and the potential health benefits},
Journal = {BIOMETALS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential metalloid, possessing not only antioxidant
   but also anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies have shown that the
   latter may be mediated by modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation,
   although the exact mechanisms have yet to be fully characterized.
   Therefore, the objective of this review is to discuss the molecular
   mechanisms by which Se modulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to
   examine the downstream effects on NLRP3-mediated inflammation and
   pyroptotic cell death. The selenoproteins S, O, M, W, and especially
   glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) are
   involved in regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome machinery through
   modulation of redox homeostasis. In contrast, Se deficiency has been
   shown to aggravate NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment or exposure to organic pollutant
   bisphenol A (BPA). In addition to increased reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) generation, Se deficiency contributes to NLRP3-mediated
   inflammation and pyroptosis through modulation of non-coding RNA
   expression. In turn, Se supplementation mitigates NLRP3 inflammasome
   activation in liver, heart, kidneys, intestine, brain, and certain other
   tissues induced by LPS exposure, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and various
   xenobiotics including heavy metals and organic pollutants. This effect
   appears to be mediated by modulation of various components of Toll-like
   receptor (TLR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)/NRLP3, nuclear factor
   erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ROS/NLRP3, thioredoxin-interacting
   protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 pathways, and several other mechanisms including
   modulation of gut microbiota with subsequent reduction of circulating
   LPS levels. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the
   anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of Se supplementation may
   be mediated by modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.},

   clinical diagnosis. Instruments used included the Beck Depression
   Inventory-II (BDI-II), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the
   General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). Results: The findings
   indicated significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and general
   health in both groups, suggesting benefits for women with and without
   fibromyalgia. Conclusions: These findings suggest potential benefits of
   equine coaching as a complementary approach to psychoemotional
   wellbeing, although causal conclusions cannot be drawn.},

Title = {Diversity of diapausing egg ornamentation in rotifer species:
   standardizing traits},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 22},
Abstract = {The ultrastructure of rotifer diapausing eggs is poorly studied. The
   challenge of identifying clear morphological traits that distinguish
   species highlights the potential for developing taxonomic parameters to
   improve rotifer species identification. Therefore, this study aims to
   expand the database of diapausing eggs and standardize the definitions
   of the traits observed in the eggshells. This standardization will
   provide key taxonomic characteristics that can be useful in species
   identification. A total of 764 diapausing eggs from 18 rotifer species
   were analyzed from sediment and cultures, using light and scanning
   electron microscopy. We identified and described ten interspecific
   morphological traits, including grooves, wrinkles, pores, reticulations,
   pillars, corrugated surface, exogenous membrane, intertwined fibers, and
   spines. The miscellaneous combinations between traits of the 18 species
   studied also supported unique morphotypes and, therefore, reinforced
   species-specific hypotheses. However, there is a high number of rotifer
   species that have not been studied yet, including some complex cases
   that still require a deep review. Thus, the standardization of eggshell
   traits becomes crucial as a taxonomical tool, but also due to the fact
   that their structure is always connected with functionality, which is in
   turn linked to evolution and ecology.},

   broadened modes, consistent with phonon confinement effects. SQUID
   magnetometry confirmed superparamagnetic-like behavior of the
   nanoparticles at room temperature, characterized by low coercivity and
   remanence, with a blocking temperature of 210 K and
   saturationmagnetization of Ms = 51 emu/g. Complementing the experimental

Abstract = {In this work, we used Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents
   (COSMO-RS) to calculate the parameters that characterize the
   interactions between molecular segments in a coarse-grained
   representation of the PLGA-PEG-PLGA mesomolecule. The computed activity
   coefficients at infinite dilution were then used to obtain the
   thermodynamic Flory-Huggins interaction parameters, which were
   subsequently transferred to Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations.
   In these simulations, beads interact through repulsive conservative
   parameters to investigate the self-aggregation of the PLGA-PEG-PLGA
   triblock copolymer. The parameters were then applied in Dissipative
   Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations at varying copolymer concentrations.
   Self assembling at different concentrations was studied. Transitions
   from core-shell spherical micelles to onion-like, columnar and lamellar
   structures were obtained in terms of copolymer concentration, setting
   the optimal concentration range for different drug loaded vehicles.},

   Mexico's Subnational Congresses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 20},
Abstract = {This study examines the drivers and dynamics of women's rights advocacy
   within Mexico's subnational legislatures. Drawing on an original dataset
   of nearly 47,000 legislative proposals and biographical information for
   over 2,200 legislators across 32 state congresses (2014-2022), the
   research investigates which actors champion women's rights, the
   institutional and personal characteristics that shape their behavior,
   and the extent to which their efforts result in substantive legal
   change. The analysis focuses on three dimensions: the volume of
   women<acute accent>s rights bills (WRB) sponsored, the legal complexity
   of these proposals, and their likelihood of enactment. Results reveal
   that sex, institutional leadership roles, and partisan affiliation
   significantly influence legislative engagement. Female legislators are
   consistently more active in sponsoring WRB, particularly those with
   committee or party leadership roles. However, most approved proposals
   target secondary legislation, limiting structural transformation. The
   study contributes to the literature on substantive representation by
   highlighting how institutional access, legislative experience, and party
   dynamics intersect with sex to shape policy outcomes. It also raises
   critical questions about the limitations of symbolic inclusion and the
   barriers to enacting far-reaching reforms at the local level.},

Abstract = {This study presents an innovative modification to the chemical bath
   deposition method for synthesizing zinc oxide thin films by
   incorporating a high-voltage electric field, with and without electrical
   polarity inversion, to influence film growth dynamics. Two
   configurations were developed to assess the effects of electric field
   strength, periodic inversion, air agitation, and solution pH on the
   morphological, structural, and optical properties of ZnO coatings.
   Morphology studies revealed that particle size, shape, and distribution
   were strongly dependent on synthesis parameters, with electric field and
   air injection enabling higher surface coverage and finer nanostructures.
   Crystalline structural analysis confirmed the formation of the wurtzite
   ZnO phase, with reduced interplanar spacing and crystallite size under
   electric fields, especially when polarity was inverted. Optical
   measurements showed a consistent increase in the band gap (blue shift)
   and reduced defect-related absorption when electric field is applied.
   These findings are evidence that controlled electric field application
   during chemical bath deposition enables precise tuning of ZnO film
   properties.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C},

Abstract = {Beliefs and religious diversity of a country form a complex system of
   multiple interrelated components, profoundly influencing the daily lives
   of millions of people. From the 2016 National Survey on Religious
   Beliefs and Practice in Mexico (ENCREER/RIFREM), we focus on one of its
   survey questions: ``To what do you attribute your stability, success, or
   failure in your life?,{''} which offered answers such as personal
   effort, luck, fate, God's will, karma, compliance with God's laws and
   social conditions. Using Pearson correlations, Multiple Correspondence
   Analysis (MCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we identify
   distinct attribution patterns shaped by religion, spirituality,
   education and socio-economic background. Secular individuals tend to
   emphasize personal effort, while divine explanations are more common
   among conservative religious groups. Belief in fate and karma is linked
   to spiritual openness and higher levels of education. Overall, these
   findings reveal how different beliefs, practices and explanatory
   worldviews coexist in contemporary Mexico.},

Title = {Cyanobacteria as facilitators for benthic macroinvertebrates: assessing
   factors involved in the establishment and conservation of aquatic
   interactions and biodiversity in tropical rivers in Mexico},
Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {88},

Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Interactions between organisms of different trophic levels are not only
   involved in the functioning of aquatic systems such as rivers but also
   crucial to maintaining taxonomic and functional diversity. This study
   aimed to evaluate the diversity of benthic cyanobacteria and their role
   as facilitating species for the colonization of benthic
   macroinvertebrates (MIB) in tropical mountain rivers with varying
   ecological conservation statuses. We sampled ten river segments in
   central Mexico, assessing physical and chemical parameters and
   collecting macroscopic cyanobacterial growths. A taxonomic and
   morphofunctional characterization was conducted for both biological
   groups, while a land-use change index (CDI) was calculated to assess the
   ecological quality of the sites. The analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)
   showed that cyanobacterial taxa are the factor that determines
   significant differences in the composition of MIB assemblages, with
   Cricotopus, Tanytarsini, Simulium, and Baetis being the most
   representative taxa according to the similarity percentage analysis
   (SIMPER). We also constructed an interactions network comprising eight
   cyanobacterial and 32 MIB taxa. The dominance of dipterans reflects
   substrate specialization, while the prevalence of collector morphologies
   suggests indirect food acquisition. While MIB were observed in
   unilateral associations with filamentous cyanobacteria, they formed
   multilateral associations with colonial species. Cricotopus showed a
   preference for both Nostoc tlalocii and Cyanoplacoma aff. regulare,
   revealing nonexclusive mutualistic relationships. This study
   demonstrated that cyanobacteria are important substrates for MIB to
   complete their life cycle, including the use of different species that
   are similar in their level of organization and therefore thallus
   morphology. This interaction network demonstrates adaptability, with
   some interactions being nonexclusive. Substrate turnover and voltinism
   in MIB may be linked to resiliency in the face of habitat changes caused
   by anthropogenic activities in the studied river basins.},

Abstract = {The widely distributed Neotropical frog Leptodactylus fuscus has long
   been suspected to represent a species complex. Among its numerous
   synonyms is Leptodactylus gualambensis Gallardo, 1964, described based
   on specimens from the western SouthAmerican Gran Chaco and regarded as a
   typical Chacoan species. This species was synonymized 40 years ago and
   has not been reassessed since. In this study, we evaluate the taxonomic
   validity of the Chacoan populations of L. fuscus potentially assignable
   to L. gualambensis, based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, lineage
   delimitation, bioacoustics, and morphology using extensive sampling from
   the South American Gran Chaco and adjacent regions. Our phylogenetic
   analyses revealed three clades: One distributed across northern South
   America and Central America, including topotypes of L. fuscus; a second
   primarily occurring in the SouthAmerican Gran Chaco, including topotypes
   of L. gualambensis; and a third found in parts of Paraguay, Argentina,
   and Brazil. This structure is corroborated by lineage delimitation
   analysis, genetic differentiation, gene flow estimations, and by
   differences in advertisement call duration and frequency, as well as
   head and limb proportions. Based on these results, we support the
   revalidation of L. gualambensis, redefine the geographic distribution of
   L. fuscus sensu stricto, and discuss the status of other available
   synonyms. In addition, we discuss variation in certain morphological
   traits of L. gualambensis that may be associated with its broad
   geographic distribution, which encompasses both dry, highly seasonal
   environments and humid, relatively homogeneous habitats.},

Title = {Ocean Species Discoveries 13-27-Taxonomic contributions to the diversity
   of Polychaeta, Mollusca and Crustacea},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Background Despite centuries of exploration, marine invertebrate
   biodiversity remains notably under-described. The majority of species in
   major marine groups are still unnamed, limiting our ability to
   understand and conserve ecosystems facing rapid environmental change.
   The rate of species discovery continues to outpace the formal process of
   species description. This gap creates an urgent need for streamlined,
   scalable approaches to taxonomy. The SENCKENBERG OCEAN SPECIES ALLIANCE
   was founded to help meet this challenge by facilitating global
   collaboration, offering technical support for species documentation and
   promoting efficient taxonomic publishing. Within this framework, Ocean
   Species Discoveries provides a forum for concise, but data-rich
   descriptions of marine invertebrate taxa. This second collection
   presents a diverse set of taxonomic contributions, based on recent and
   historical collections, including newly-described species and a
   re-description of a previously poorly-known taxon. The integrative
   documentation of the taxa treated herein was facilitated by the
   newly-established Discovery Laboratory at the Senckenberg Research
   Institute, the first service unit dedicated to supporting alpha
   taxonomists. New information This article presents 14 new species and
   one re-description, two new genera, with taxa spanning three phyla.
   Newly-described taxa comprise two polychaete annelids: Nicon salinus
   Hern \& aacute;ndez-Alc \& aacute;ntara \& D \& aacute;vila-Jim \&
   eacute;nez, sp. nov. and Spinther bohnorum Tilic \& Rouse, sp. nov.
   Molluscs span four classes, with three polyplacophorans: Craspedochiton
   zefranki Von \& ccaron;ina, sp. nov., Ferreiraella charazata Sigwart,
   sp. nov. and a new genus with type species Pycnodontochiton sinensis
   Sirenko, Zhang \& Sigwart, gen. et sp. nov. and Pycnodontochiton
   tenuidontus (Saito and Okutani, 1990), comb. nov. The new
   monoplacophoran Veleropilina gretchenae Sigwart \& Steger, sp. nov. is
   one of the first species of this class with a high-quality genome,
   published from the specimen that is now the holotype. The scaphopod
   Laevidentalium wiesei Sahlmann, 2012 represents a re-description and
   range extension and the bivalve Myonera aleutiana Machado \& Sigwart,
   sp. nov. is the second bivalve including an anatomical description with
   noninvasive methods using micro-CT. Amongst crustaceans, there are two
   new amphipod species: Apotectonia senckenbergae Momtazi \& Riehl, sp.
   nov. and Metharpinia hirsuta Souza-Filho \& Andrade, sp. nov. Three
   isopod species were described, including the parasitic species Zeaione
   everta Boyko \& Williams, sp. nov. that is the only species in the new
   genus Zeaione Boyko \& Williams, gen. nov. and two free-living isopods:
   Haploniscus bulbosus Henseler, Knauber \& Riehl, sp. nov. and
   Macrostylis peteri Riehl, sp. nov. Finally, there are two new
   tanaidaceans: Hoplopolemius olo J \& oacute;\& zacute;wiak \& St@pie \&
   nacute;, sp. nov. and Nesotanais thalassinus St@pie \& nacute;, sp. nov.
   The data used for the description often of the species and one of the
   new genera treated herein were wholly or partially obtained at the SOSA
   Discovery Laboratory using integrative methods including light and
   electron microscopy, confocal imaging, molecular barcoding and micro-CT
   scanning. Additional novel findings include the first record of the
   family Macrostylidae and the genus Macrostylis G. O. Sars, 1864 from
   Australian waters (Macrostylis peteri, sp. nov.) and novel host
   associations: Ferreiraella charazata, sp. nov.
   is documented with epibiotic tubeworms on its tail valves that are
   typical of this genus and the decapod Eucalliaxiopsis aequimana (Baker,
   1907) is newly recorded as a host for bopyrid isopods, representing the
   first such record for the family Eucalliacidae.},

Journal = {PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {715},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Disordered alloys of silver and gold have been in the interest of the
   condensed matter community for decades. Although they are considered
   well-known materials, surprises have appeared that have not been fully
   understood, e.g., experimental results of the electronic specific heat
   at low temperatures of disordered Ag-Au alloys. Green and Valladares
   (1966) conducted experimental studies of gamma, the coefficient of the
   temperature in the expression for the electronic specific heat at low
   temperatures, finding a parabolic behavior as a function of the
   concentration. Several ulterior experiments corroborated this parabolic
   behavior, and theoretical attempts followed that did not satisfactorily
   succeed at the explanation. The parabolic behavior is reproduced in this
   computational work as a function of concentration. As a byproduct an
   estimation of the electron-mass renormalization due to the
   electron-phonon interaction was obtained for all concentrations,
   estimation that agrees with the limited number of experiments.},

Title = {Multi-scale impacts of land use change and fragmentation on reptile
   diversity patterns in subtropical landscapes from Mexico},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 15},
Abstract = {Land use change drives biodiversity loss, but fragmented landscapes can
   still support substantial biodiversity. To explore the dynamics between
   landscape characteristics and diversity, multi-scale analyses are
   needed. We examined reptile taxonomic and functional diversity in two
   subtropical landscapes within the Sierra Madre del Sur, a biodiverse
   region in southern Mexico with urgent conservation needs. Reptile
   communities were surveyed across various land use types, and predictor
   variables were analyzed at local and landscape scales. Functional trait
   variations between land use types were examined, and functionally
   unique, specialized, and endangered species were identified. Higher
   tax-onomic/functional diversity was observed in forest patches compared
   to croplands and non-natural pastures, though common species/functional
   groups were more diverse in the latter. We observed greater trait
   diversity in forest patches, as well as functionally special-ized,
   unique, and endangered species. Reptile abundance and diversity were
   positively related to local vegetation and forest cover within 100-500 m
   landscape scales. At larger spatial scales, the presence of other land
   use types was an important driver of overall diversity. These findings
   underscore the conservation value of both large and small forest patches
   for reptile conservation, which may be serving as source habitats for
   disturbed land uses. However, at broader scales, a more heterogeneous
   landscape may enhance overall diversity, so efforts should consider the
   conservation value of other land use types within the landscapes. A
   holistic conservation approach, integrating landscape-scale fac-tors and
   local variables, is essential for understanding and preserving reptile
   diversity in these fragmented landscapes.},

Title = {Expression patterns of PIK3CA and PTEN in cancer and type
   2 diabetes mellitus},
Journal = {GENE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {969},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer share key metabolic and
   molecular pathways, including the PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling cascade, which
   plays a central role in glucose metabolism and cell proliferation. This
   study aimed to evaluate the expression levels of PIK3CA and PTEN genes
   in individuals with cancer and T2DM, to explore their potential role in
   cancer progression among diabetic patients. A total of 115 individuals
   were categorized into four groups: healthy controls (C, n = 27),
   patients with T2DM (SD, n = 30), cancer patients (Ca, n = 28), and
   patients with both cancer and diabetes (CD, n = 30). Gene expression was
   analyzed by real-time PCR, and biochemical parameters were assessed.
   Statistical analysis included the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman
   correlation tests. The expression of the PIK3CA gene was significantly
   higher in the Ca group compared to the other groups (p = 0.0435), with
   77 \% of cancer patients exhibiting overexpression. In contrast, only 37
   \% of CD patients showed PIK3CA overexpression. The expression of the
   PTEN gene was significantly lower in the SD and CD groups compared to
   the Ca group (p < 0.05). No significant differences in PIK3CA expression
   were observed among different cancer types. These findings suggest that
   PIK3CA and PTEN may serve as potential peripheral indicators of systemic
   alterations in the PI3K/PTEN pathway in cancer and T2DM, highlighting
   the need for further research, including tissue validation and biomarker
   performance assessment.},

Title = {Functional connectivity patterns of the Giant Toad Rhinella
   horribilis in anthropogenically modified landscapes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Anthropized environments often fragment native habitats and alter the
   movement of individuals across the modified landscape mosaic, which is
   significantly challenging for wild species. Deciphering the
   environmental factors associated with population genetic patterns in
   modified habitats is essential to understand functional connectivity and
   for the conservation of wild populations inhabiting increasingly
   modified habitats. We used ddRAD-seq genomic data to study the genetic
   diversity, genetic structure and functional connectivity of the Giant
   Toad, Rhinella horribilis populations across two landscapes with
   distinct levels of habitat modification. We also applied a landscape
   genetics approach to identify landscape variables (climatic, vegetation,
   water bodies, land use) associated with the toad's functional
   connectivity in both landscapes. Structure analysis between the two
   landscapes show that they are genetically differentiated given their
   distinct degree of habitat modification. Within landscapes, our results
   identified lower genetic diversity, higher genetic structure and lower
   functional connectivity among R. horribilis populations in the landscape
   with higher habitat modification. Results also demonstrate that
   structure and functional connectivity are significantly influenced by
   barriers like rivers and roads. Furthermore, water bodies availability
   was the most important landscape feature for R. horribilis connectivity,
   whereas vegetation cover, solar radiation and relative humidity also
   played a significant role. Our study illustrates how landscape features
   in modified habitats can differently determine genetic diversity and
   functional connectivity patterns, and highlights the importance of
   working with often-disregarded common species like the Giant Toad.
   Prioritizing the management of water bodies in our study sites and
   elsewhere would be essential to sustain amphibian population dynamics,
   enhancing individual movement and genetic exchange.},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Local socioenvironmental governance and socioenvironmental outcomes are
   shaped by the interaction between local institutions and
   global-national-regional governance frameworks. We employ the
   institutional bricolage (IB) framework to analyze local perspectives
   regarding conservation, development, local socio-political relations,
   control over lands, and policy outcomes, in the context of the Maya
   Train project and Sembrando Vida (Sowing Life) program, in the Southern
   Yucat \& aacute;n Peninsula. We used Q methodology to analyze the
   subjective foundations of local governance based on 50 interviews and
   subsequently conducted with 17 participants selected based on their
   regional knowledge, community leadership, and contrasting opinions. Our
   analysis delineated four distinctive local perspectives, which underpin
   ongoing institutional crafting. These, in turn, shape socioenvironmental
   governance and the outcomes of conservation and development
   interventions. Our findings challenge simplified narratives depicting
   rural communities as either resisting or embracing external
   interventions. Instead, they reveal dynamic, context-specific
   engagements, where actors selectively align with or contest external
   agendas to advance local objectives. Such negotiations often blend
   traditional norms and new institutional arrangements, yielding hybrid
   governance models. This study shows how IB operates as a strategic mode
   of agency within asymmetrical power structures. We illuminate how rural
   governance emerges through locally driven negotiations that blend
   consensus and divergence among discursive profiles, in turn underpinning
   hybrid institutions that defy top-down designs and rigid binaries.},

Title = {Key neuropeptide and neuroendocrine pathways of the optic lobe are
   affected by high temperatures in the female Octopus maya},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS \& PROTEOMICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {56},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study investigated the neuroendocrine role of the optic lobe (OL)
   in Octopus maya females during reproduction. While previous
   neuroendocrine research in octopus has focused on the gonads, optic
   glands, olfactory lobes, and oviducal glands, the role of the OL remains
   less explored. A transcriptomic approach was used to compare gene
   expression in the OL across reproductive stages-mating, egg-laying, and
   senescence-and with other tissues. Additionally, mature females were
   exposed to a thermal challenge (TC), and their OL transcriptomes were
   compared to those maintained at optimal temperatures (24 degrees C).
   Compared to other octopus' tissues, the OL transcriptome was enriched
   with genes encoding neuropeptides, neuroendocrine proteins, and
   neurotransmitter-modifying enzymes, confirming its neuroendocrine
   functions. Notably, transcripts of the LWamide neuropeptide, which is
   involved in life-stage transitions, were exclusively detected in the OL.
   Genes from neuroendocrine and neuropeptide pathways exhibited stable
   expression patterns throughout the reproductive stages. However, the TC
   induced stage-specific changes in gene expression. For instance, at the
   mating stage, transcripts of FMRF-amide, buccalin, and neuropeptide
   prohormone-4 were upregulated. At the egg-laying stage, apoptotic
   transcripts were upregulated, while genes encoding the neuroendocrine
   protein 7B2 and multiple ATPases were downregulated. Finally, at the
   senescence stage, mitochondrial and metabolic transcripts were
   downregulated by the TC. Temperature-driven changes in gene expression
   during the mating and egg-laying stages could be linked to a decrease in
   the reproductive success of this octopus species. This study confirms
   the critical role of OL in neuropeptide and neuroendocrine pathways that
   regulate the physiology and reproduction of octopuses.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {A detailed computational study is performed on the structural and
   spectroscopic properties of R3PAuCl (R = H, Me, Et) compounds, combining
   density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)
   calculations. The investigation addresses the conformational behavior of
   monomeric and dimeric species in the gas phase and in solution using the
   conductor-like screening model (COSMO). Dispersion-corrected
   optimizations reveal that molecular aggregation significantly influences
   geometry and spectral response. Energy decomposition analysis is
   employed to quantify the nature of the noncovalent interactions
   stabilizing the dimeric arrangements. Simulated ultraviolet-visible
   (UV-vis) spectra, including both radiative and nonradiative transitions,
   are computed with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), highlighting
   its impact on spectral intensity and agreement with experiment.
   Solvatochromic trends are analyzed across solvents (toluene,
   tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide), showing that
   excited-state dipole moments play a central role in the observed shifts.
   A saturation effect in the solvent response is identified, suggesting
   limitations of the implicit solvation model at high polarity. The
   combined results provide a coherent framework to interpret the
   structural and photophysical properties of these systems and emphasize
   the relevance of accounting for aggregation state (monomer or dimer),
   dispersion, SOC, and solvent effects to achieve quantitative agreement
   with experimental UV-vis spectra.},

Title = {Spatial Prioritization for the Zonation of a Reef System in a New Remote

Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that provide essential
   ecological and environmental services but are increasingly threatened by
   anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Effective conservation of
   reef systems within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be enhanced using
   spatially explicit approaches that integrate habitat mapping and
   ecological metrics at seascape scales. In this study, we characterized
   the benthic seascape of Cayo Arenas and identified optimal priority
   conservation zones in one of the core zones of the recently established
   Southern Gulf of Mexico Reefs National Park (SGMRNP). In July 2023,
   ground-truthing was performed to quantify the cover of sand, calcareous
   matrix, macroalgae, hard corals and octocorals. Cluster analysis of
   quantitative data and ecological similarity between classes was used to
   identify the main benthic habitat classes. Object-based and supervised
   classification algorithms on a PlanetScope image were used to construct
   a thematic map of the benthic reef system. Based on the thematic map,
   habitat connectivity, beta-diversity, patch compactness, and
   availability for commercial species were estimated. In addition, a
   benthic change analysis (2017-2013), based on the spectral
   characteristics of PlanetScope images, was performed. The layers
   obtained were then used to perform an iterative weighted overlay
   analysis (WOA) using 126 combinations. Six main habitat classes, with
   different coverages of hard corals, calcareous matrix, macroalgae, and
   sand, were identified. Habitats with calcareous matrix and sandy
   substrates dominated the seascape. High habitat compactness,
   connectivity, and beta-diversity values were observed, suggesting
   habitat stability and ecologically dynamic areas. Based on the WOA,
   eight optimal priority areas for conservation were recognized. These
   areas are characterized by heterogeneous habitats, moderate coral cover,
   and high connectivity. We provide a spatially explicit approach that can
   strengthen conservation planning within the SGMRNP and other MPAs,
   particularly by assisting zonation and sub-zonation processes.},

Title = {Carbon storage in mountain cloud forest communities, Jalpan de Serra,

Journal = {CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Background Mountain cloud forests (MCF) are vulnerable ecosystems that
   harbor considerable biodiversity and are essential carbon regulators.
   However, information is scarce on the carbon storage potential and its
   patterns of variability across the conservation gradient in these
   forests. This study determined the carbon storage potential, the
   contribution of different pools, and their relationship with the degree
   of forest and soil conservation. Results The organic carbon storage of
   the communities ranged from 145.9 to 279 Mg C ha(-1). Soil was the
   primary pool (68.08-198.1 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by above-ground biomass
   (42.87 - 116.74 Mg C ha(-1)), while the contribution of litter and roots
   was less. The contribution of above-ground biomass to the carbon stock
   was low due to the level of timber and fuelwood extraction present in
   these communities. The high carbon storage potential of the soil pool is
   determined by the presence of the O horizon, with a thickness of 8-10
   cm, forming mull-type humus and a deep organo-mineral surface horizon
   with a high carbon content > 10 g kg(-1), and with varying degrees of
   humification. The formation of clay-humus complexes maintains carbon
   stabilization and the formation of deep surface horizons (between 20 and
   38 cm deep). Conclusion The results show that the carbon sequestration
   potential of the MCF is found in the soil associated with the organic
   horizons that develop at the surface and the presence of deep A horizons
   with high carbon content. The conservation of these layers, despite
   forest management, reflected in the aerial biomass, demonstrates the
   resilience of the soil due to carbon stabilization, attributed to the
   composition of resistant organic compounds and the formation of
   clay-humus complexes, which reduce the impact of degradation from
   erosion. This indicates that the conditions of the MCF still sustain the
   ecological and biogeochemical processes that support carbon
   sequestration and are regulated by the conservation policies of the
   Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, Quer \& eacute;taro, Mexico.},

   nanomaterial. The adsorption of acetone molecules onto both pristine and
   M-doped silicene was examined. This was done focusing on key parameters
   such as adsorption energy, work function and molecular dynamics.
   Furthermore, the interaction of acetone with M-doped silicene altered
   the adsorption energy of pristine silicene (0.5 eV), which ranged from
   0.87 to 1.32 eV.},

Title = {Inverse geo-electromagnetic modeling: a systematic review and
   bibliometric assessment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Inverse electromagnetic (EM) modeling plays a pivotal role in subsurface
   exploration, enabling the characterization of the Earth's electrical
   properties for various applications, including resource exploration,
   environmental monitoring, and geohazard assessment. Despite significant
   advancements in the field, the EM inverse problem remains inherently
   challenging due to its ill-posed and nonlinear nature. A diverse range
   of methodologies, including deterministic, non-deterministic, and
   machine learning-based (ML-based) approaches, have been proposed to
   address these challenges. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive
   synthesis that integrates both the theoretical evolution of these
   methods and their bibliometric performance. This paper addresses this
   gap by combining a systematic review of modern computational
   methodologies with a bibliometric assessment of the scientific
   literature on inverse EM modeling. The systematic review critically
   evaluates key computational approaches, examining their theoretical
   foundations, practical applications, and limitations, while the
   bibliometric assessment provides a quantitative assessment of scientific
   productivity, trends, and contributions from different nations. This
   integrated perspective offers a unified overview of the field,
   identifies emerging research directions, and highlights the
   state-of-the-art in inverse EM modeling. The findings provide valuable
   insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, guiding
   future advancements and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.},

Abstract = {Oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) are essential tools for simulating
   atmospheric aging of aerosols, yet conventional laminar-flow designs
   often suffer from non-uniform oxidant exposure, broad residence time
   distributions (RTDs), and significant wall losses, limiting their
   ability to replicate real-world gas-and-particle-phase processes. Here,
   we present the design, hydrodynamic characterization, and experimental
   validation of a novel Annular Cylindrical Oxidation Flow Reactor
   (AC-OFR) featuring an optimized annular-flow geometry. Using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and a full factorial
   design of experiments, we identified reactor dimensions that minimize
   recirculation and dead volume, achieving RTDs approaching ideal plug
   flow for both gases and particles. Experimental measurements confirmed
   high transmission efficiencies for ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particles
   (50-800 nm), with strong gas-particle coupling and minimal wall losses.
   The AC-OFR enables precise, tunable oxidant exposures-reaching OH
   radical exposures equivalent to 0.5-15.3 days with 7 s-1 of external OH
   reactivity added and ozone exposures up to 0.74 days of atmospheric
   aging-by adjusting the UV lamp free surface. Validation experiments with
   alpha-pinene demonstrated steady-state secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
   yields (0.11-0.14) consistent with or exceeding those reported for
   traditional OFRs and revealed robust nucleation and growth dynamics. The
   AC-OFR thus provides a flexible, high-performance platform for
   controlled gas and gas-particle oxidation studies, bridging laboratory
   experimentation and atmospheric processes.},

Abstract = {The full understanding of the parasite fauna of a host species requires
   sampling individuals across their entire distribution range. However,
   very few studies include an analysis considering such geographical
   coverage. The Ocellated killifish, Floridichthys polyommus, is an
   endemic estuarine fish whose distribution spans from the southwestern
   Gulf of Mexico to Belize. Here, we aimed at describing the metazoan
   parasite fauna of F. polyommus in localities across the Yucat \&
   aacute;n Peninsula to assess the parasite species richness at regional
   and local scales. From 2022 to 2024, 409 specimens of F. polyommus were
   collected from six localities. Data from three localities from a
   previous study were also included. Individuals were dissected, and
   examined for ecto and endoparasites. Twenty-four metazoan parasite taxa
   were identified using morphological characters and/or molecular data.
   Thirteen parasite taxa correspond to larval stages. Nine parasite taxa
   represent new host records, increasing to 35 the total number of
   metazoan parasites known for F. polyommus. The nematode Contracaecum sp.
   was found in all sampled localities, whereas the cestode Glossocercus
   caribaensis and the copepod Ergasilus sp. were found in seven, with
   variable prevalence and mean intensity of infection values. Two general
   patterns were uncovered irrespective of the geographical scale of the
   analyses (local or regional): (1) Digeneans were the most species-rich
   parasite group and (2) F. polyommus harboured more larval parasite taxa
   than adults. It seems that the parasite fauna of the Ocellated killifish
   in each sampling site represent a subsample of the total species
   richness at the regional level.},

Title = {Burial practices and mtDNA variation in the Oaxacan Barrio of

Abstract = {The Oaxacan Barrio (neighborhood) in Teotihuacan is relevant for
   understanding interaction between Mesoamerican cities during the Classic
   Period (CE 100-700). In this work, we analyzed the relationship between
   burial practices and mitochondrial (mt) DNA variation for the Oaxacan
   Barrio and the published data of other Teotihuacan neighborhoods and
   ethnic groups outside. We observed two Pre-Columbian burials in the
   Barrio, one in flexed lateral decubitus and another in extended dorsal
   decubitus, which was more common (79\%). The extended dorsal burial
   persisted until the Colonial Period, when a burial with arms crossed
   over the chest, possibly Christian, appeared. The Pre-Columbian Oaxacan
   Barrio exhibited no mtDNA differentiation between sexes and was closer
   to northwestern Zapotecs of the Classic Period among the groups
   compared, suggesting that it was genetically and thus culturally
   isolated within the city. Teotihuacan neighborhoods exhibited different
   genetic affinities with Oaxacan groups and a spatial structure of mtDNA
   around the Street of the Dead, consisting of larger B-type contents in
   the city's northeast, A types in the west and east, C types in the
   south, and D types in the midwest. Most mitochondrial lineages in the
   Barrio originated from Oaxaca, preceded by gene flow with the Maya
   region. A Barrio's elite female, who exhibited Mayan ornaments and body
   modifications, showed a mitochondrial C1 type more closely related to
   Oaxaca than to the Maya region. Mitochondrial lineages also showed
   continuity between the Pre-Columbian and the Colonial Oaxacan Barrio,
   despite the arrival of new occupants-mainly Aztec-after the Classic
   Period.},

Abstract = {Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19 disease has the ability to generate
   sequelae that extend for weeks or months, giving rise to long-term
   COVID-19 disease. This condition reduces patients' quality of life and
   predisposes them to several alterations, including failures in the blood
   coagulation system. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated
   abnormalities in endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) of patients
   recovered from COVID-19. Objective. To analyze the functional state of
   ECFCs in patients who experienced venous thromboembolic disease (VTD) or
   arterial thrombosis (AT) during long COVID-19, or post-COVID condition
   (PCC). Methods. We compared 35 samples of peripheral blood (PB)
   mononuclear cells (MNCs) from patients with a thrombotic event (who had
   a healthy lifestyle before infection and were vaccinated) with 10
   healthy volunteers and 10 samples from patients with a history of
   recurrent unprovoked VTD (rVTD) after a COVID-19 infection. The samples
   were cryopreserved in our laboratory and matched by age 25-50 years old
   and sex. The frequency, morphological characteristics, proliferation and
   angiogenic ability of ECFCs were evaluated in all samples. Results.
   There were no significant differences between male and female patients,
   and the laboratory data did not indicate risk factors for VTD or AT. The
   frequency of ECFCs was not different between controls and patients, but
   a reduced proliferative capacity, a high percentage of senescence and
   non-angiogenic activity were observed in VTD samples. Conclusions. Our
   results demonstrate a strong association between VTD events in patients
   with PCC who had a healthy lifestyle prior to infection and ECFCs
   dysfunction. (c) 2025 Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS).

Abstract = {The genus Sceloporus represents a diverse and ecologically significant
   group of lizards within the Mexican herpetofauna, particularly in the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), a region of exceptional endemism
   increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures. In this study, we
   conducted a comprehensive spatial vulnerability assessment of 17 species
   of Sceloporus that are present in the TMVB, integrating ecological niche
   modelling (ENM), habitat fragmentation metrics, land-use exposure and
   protected area overlap. Binary distribution maps were generated from the
   ensemble models optimised with biomod2. For each species, we calculated
   the habitat area, number of habitat patches and mean patch size,
   synthesising these values into a composite vulnerability index. Land-use
   pressures were quantified through spatial overlaying of urban,
   agricultural and pasture-land layers, followed by principal component
   analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering to generate a multivariate
   anthropogenic pressure zonation. Species distributions were also
   compared against those of state and federal protected areas. The
   17-species analysis revealed noteworthy variation in spatial dimensions
   and fragmentation of habitat, exhibiting high spatial vulnerability and
   high exposure to anthropogenic pressure. Furthermore, our results
   revealed that the predicted habitats of all 17 species overlap with
   highly transformed urban landscapes. A bivariate risk assessment
   identified S. megalepidurus as the only species with both high pressure
   and high vulnerability, while the species S. anahuacus, S. albiventris
   and S. minor, currently listed as ``least concern{''} or ``not
   evaluated{''} by the IUCN, showed alarming risk signals when spatially
   explicit metrics were incorporated. Our integrative framework
   underscores the need to revisit conservation assessments by
   incorporating habitat quality, fragmentation and exposure to land-use
   pressures, not just geographic range.},

Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Since it is easy to envision that prebiotically synthesized molecules
   underwent reactions comparable or even identical to those that occur in
   some metabolic pathways, it has been argued that biosynthetic routes
   emerged from the direct assembly of these prebiotic reactants. However,
   although in prebiotic simulation experiments several products present in
   extant metabolic routes may be formed at the same time, in biosynthetic
   pathways, the same precursor undergoes a stepwise transformation into
   other compounds, allowing changes of energy to occur that are necessary
   for the energetic independence of cells. In other words, from
   thermodynamic and equilibrium perspectives, the availability of many or
   all of the chemical components of a metabolic route does not necessarily
   imply that they will spontaneously be linked in linear or cyclic
   pathways. Although a number of chemical changes that mimic or are
   identical to a number of metabolic reactions may have taken place in the
   primitive environment, in the absence of a genetic apparatus ensuring
   the stability and diversification of the catalysts and hypothetical
   pathways, it is difficult to picture the continuity and evolution of
   such chains of reactions.This article is part of the theme issue
   `Origins of life: the possible and the actual'.},

Title = {A long-term culture model for investigating senescence-associated
   dysregulation in macrophages},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Macrophage senescence is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to
   immune dysfunction during aging and chronic inflammation. Here, we
   developed a reproducible long-term in vitro culture model to investigate
   the senescence's phenotypic and functional consequences in human
   macrophages. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were cultured for 7,
   14, or 21 days and assessed for canonical senescence markers and immune
   function. While macrophages at day 7 exhibited minimal expression of
   beta-galactosidase, H2AXpS139, and CDKN2A (p16INK4a), these markers were
   significantly upregulated at days 14 and 21, indicating progressive
   acquisition of a senescent phenotype. Cell viability remained above 95\%
   across all time points, confirming the system's stability.
   High-dimensional flow cytometry and unsupervised clustering revealed
   marked phenotypic remodeling over time, shifting from anti-inflammatory
   CD163+/CD206+ profiles to proinflammatory CD14+/CD64+/TLR2+ populations.
   Five distinct macrophage subpopulations were identified, each with
   dynamic temporal distribution and unique marker expression, highlighting
   a loss of plasticity and emergence of senescence-associated states.
   Functionally, day 7 macrophages produced a diverse cytokine panel
   responding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), including IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-4,
   IL-5, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, and IL-10. In contrast, macrophages
   at days 14 and 21 displayed a markedly restricted cytokine profile,
   retaining the secretion of cytokines but significantly downregulating
   the secretion of Th1-type cytokines. This long-term culture model
   constitutes a robust, physiologically relevant tool to study immune
   aging, senescence-driven immune reprogramming, and inflammation in
   macrophages with the potential for the preclinical evaluation of
   therapeutic strategies to ameliorate inflammaging and restore immune
   competence.},

Abstract = {Jefea lantanifolia (S. Schauer) Strother is traditionally used in
   Hidalgo, Mexico, to manage type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aerial parts are
   prepared as an infusion and consumed throughout the day. This study
   conducted a 2 h acute experiment under both fasting and postprandial
   conditions to evaluate the effects of the aqueous infusion (AE), the
   ethanol-water extract (EWE), and their isolated constituents in
   hyperglycemic rats. Structures were established using conventional
   spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration was determined by
   optical rotation and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD)
   methods. Phytochemical analysis led to the isolation of six compounds:
   luteolin (1); 2 beta-hydroxy-dimerostemma
   brasiolide-1-O-(3-hydroxymethacrylate) (2); homoplantaginin (3); cynarin
   (4); luteolin-7-O-glucoside (5); and nepitrin (6). The extract was
   deemed safe at a dose of 2 g/kg b. w. in acute toxicity assays. In vivo
   experiments showed significant reductions in blood glucose levels during
   fasting, with compounds 2 and 3 achieving reductions of 42\% and 40\%,
   respectively, compared to 51\% with glibenclamide. Postprandially, all
   treatments demonstrated effective glucose-lowering activity,
   particularly compound 3 and the EWE. These findings support the
   traditional use of J. lantanifolia and highlight its phytochemicals as
   promising candidates for further pharmacological investigation.
   Long-term studies and high-dose evaluations are warranted to validate
   therapeutic potential and establish safety profiles.},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Let G be a locally compact Hausdorff group. We study orbit spaces of
   equivariant absolute neighborhood extensors (G-ANE's) for the class of
   all proper G-spaces that are metrizable by a G-invariant metric. We
   prove that if a proper G-space X is a G-ANE and all G-orbits in X are
   metrizable, then the G-orbit space X/G is an ANE. Besides, if G is
   either a Lie group or an almost connected group, then for any closed
   normal subgroup Hof G, the H-orbit space X/H is a G/H-ANE provided that
   all H-orbits in X are metrizable. If, in addition, His compact then the
   hypothesis about the properness of the G-space X can be omitted. (c)

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of oxygen pressure (PO2) during
   pulsed laser deposition on the structural, ferroelectric, and
   piezoelectric properties of (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 thin films.
   Films were deposited at PO2 levels of 8.6, 10, 11.5, and 12.7 Pa. The
   optimal ferroelectric properties were observed at 10 Pa, with a remnant
   polarization of 2.97 mu C/cm2, a coercive field of 33.80 kV/cm, and a
   saturation polarization of 11.88 mu C/cm2, closely matching the target
   composition. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the
   presence of a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) near room temperature.
   The MPB shifts toward lower temperatures with increasing PO2, as
   characterized by the photoacoustic technique. Frequency measurements
   based on photoacoustic and piezoelectric effects demonstrated promising
   performance for piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers, with
   resonance frequencies ranging from 9.5 to 13 MHz.},

Title = {Fish waste silage as a functional ingredient for Octopus maya
   nutrition},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The nutritional composition of fish silage (FS) from Ocyurus chrysurus
   and blue crab silage (CS) from Callinectes sapidus was evaluated to
   determine their application in diets for Octopus maya juveniles. The
   proximal composition, amino acid, and fatty acid profile of silages were
   evaluated. The experimental diets were fish silage (FSD), crab silage
   (CSD) containing 15\% of FS and CS, respectively, and fish-crab silage
   (FCSD) containing 7.5\% of FS and 7.5\% of CS. The WSD (control)
   contained only crab and squid meal. O. maya juveniles (body weight 0.33
   +/- 0.02 g) were fed these diets for 37 days. After this period,
   survival, growth performance, digestive enzymes, glycogen of the
   digestive gland (DG), and muscle in O. maya were analyzed. Crude protein
   was the predominant nutrient in both silages: 50.7\% for FS and 37.9\%
   for CS (dry matter basis). Among the 16 amino acids identified,
   glutamate and glycine predominated in both silages. The CS had low lipid
   content (6.6\%) compared to FS (16.6\%), and palmitic, oleic,
   tridecanoic, and stearic acids were the most abundant fatty acids in
   both silages. No significant differences were found in growth
   performance and hepatosomatic index. However, the FSD promoted higher
   survival (90\%) compared to the other diets (82 at 84\%). The results of
   glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, glycogen, and specific activity
   (acid and alkaline) of the DG indicate that FSD promotes equivalent
   results as the WSD. In conclusion, FS is a valuable ingredient in the
   preparation of octopus feed.},

Title = {When adiabaticity is not enough to study topological phases in
   solid-state physics: comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan phases in
   2D materials},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Topological phases emerge as the parameters of a quantum system vary
   with time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be
   eliminated, allowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a
   closed trajectory in parameter space. In solid-state physics, this
   approach is commonly applied by taking a reciprocal space wavevector as
   the parameter, which is assumed to be varied by electromagnetic fields.
   The Berry curvature is then obtained by computing the derivatives of
   Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However, in many
   systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never
   satisfied. Specifically, at high-symmetry points, the dispersion
   relation between energy and momentum can often be approximated as linear
   (or nearly linear), leading to an effective Dirac or Weyl Hamiltonian,
   where the Berry curvature is typically computed without accounting for
   the breakdown of the adiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate
   that time-dependent topological quantities-specifically the
   Aharonov-Anandan phase-can be employed to extract information not only
   about topological properties but also about band transitions across a
   wide range of systems, including gapless 2D materials, topological
   insulators, Weyl semimetals, and tilted Dirac materials. In particular,
   we establish a relationship between the current and the Aharonov-Anandan
   phase, demonstrating that photon-induced transitions give rise to
   current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under
   electromagnetic radiation from a time-dependent perspective, showing how
   the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights
   into topology, interband transitions, and currents. This analysis is
   carried out using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the
   time-dependent equations within the framework of Floquet theory.},

Title = {Does Participatory Bird Monitoring Provide Accurate Data for Ecological
   Research? An Experience in Rural Southwestern Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rise of participatory ornithology projects in the Global North has
   spurred studies aimed at optimizing the quality of data generated by
   these initiatives to support conservation efforts. However, in Latin
   America-where these projects are typically developed in collaboration
   with rural and indigenous communities-evaluations addressing this issue
   remain scarce. This study analyzes a community-based bird monitoring
   project in southwestern Mexico and highlights key aspects for improving
   data quality. First, five members of a rural community were trained in
   bird identification and counting. Subsequently, using data generated by
   professional ornithologists as a reference, the accuracy and bias in the
   monitoring data were examined to assess bird species richness and
   community structure across forest and human-altered habitats. In
   addition, hierarchical clustering analyses were employed to identify
   biological traits of species that affect data quality. The community
   monitoring data demonstrated sufficient quality to detect changes in
   bird communities resulting from anthropogenic impacts, though there were
   identifiable biases associated with forest habitat species, migratory
   species, and species belonging to the families Trochilidae and
   Tyrannidae. The results suggest that scientific endeavors in community
   projects should focus on developing adaptive training strategies to
   enhance monitors' skills in identifying birds and recording their
   abundance. The evaluation framework proposed in this study offers a
   valuable collaborative perspective for improving data quality in
   community monitoring initiatives across Latin America.},

   Drugs},

Abstract = {Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis), caused by the protozoan
   parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is classified by the World Health
   Organization (WHO) as one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTD).
   Originally, it affected tropical regions of Latin America, but it is
   becoming globalized. Thousands of patients die annually because no
   therapeutic agents have been approved recently. Only nifurtimox and
   benznidazole are available, but these have several drawbacks, such as
   low efficacy, protozoan resistance, and human toxicity. Secondary
   metabolites found in plants offer structures that could be optimized for
   drug development. This review assesses the literature from the last 13
   years (2012-2024) about anti-T. cruzi compounds isolated from Mexican
   plants, and their activity against epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and
   amastigotes stages of the parasite. Several species, extracts, and
   compounds have a high potential for the development of new drugs;
   however, in vivo assays, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics studies
   are now needed.},

Title = {DC sputtering-driven self-organization of sub-10 nm silver nanoparticles

Journal = {NANO EXPRESS},

Abstract = {In this work, we present a simple, scalable, and reproducible physical
   strategy to fabricate functional monolayers of sub-10 nm silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) via DC sputtering. Using a 6N-purity Ag target and
   optimal conditions of 60 W, 1.8 x 10-3 Torr, and 2 s of deposition, we
   obtained quasi-spherical AgNPs homogeneously distributed over glass and
   nitrocellulose substrates, with an average Feret diameter of 8.7 +/- 4.8
   nm and an interparticle spacing of 25\% relative to their size. The
   resulting structures exhibited high morphological reproducibility across
   multiple deposition cycles, as confirmed by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and STEM,
   and showed a sharp and intense localized surface plasmon resonance
   (LSPR) at 460 nm. I-V measurements revealed an abrupt electrical
   percolation threshold at 5 s, with current increases exceeding eight
   orders of magnitude compared to non-conductive samples (<= 4 s). Films
   deposited between 5 and 10 s displayed increasingly steep I-V slopes,
   indicating reduced electrical resistance due to enhanced particle
   connectivity, although all percolated samples exhibited electrical
   breakdown at their respective power dissipation limits (0.17-0.44 W).
   HRTEM and FFT analyses confirmed the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal
   structure of the AgNPs and the presence of a thin Ag2O surface layer.
   Finally, numerical simulations supported our experimental results,
   showing that prolonged deposition times promote agglomeration and that
   larger source-to-substrate distances induce greater angular dispersion,
   reducing spatial uniformity.},

Title = {Evolutionary and Ecological Drivers of Gut Microbiota in Wild Rodent
   Species from the Yucatán Peninsula},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {The host-microbiome association is considered a coevolutionary process,
   in which the microbiome provides important functions for host
   development, physiology and health. However, the ecological and
   evolutionary forces shaping the diversity and structure of the bacterial
   communities that form the microbiome are still being elucidated. We
   assessed the composition of gut microbiota in six rodent species from
   three geographic regions across the Yucat \& aacute;n peninsula, Mexico.
   We evaluated the contribution of host species identity, phylogenetic
   relationships, and geography to the rodents' gut microbiota, using 16S
   rRNA V4 sequences. We performed a comprehensive set of analytical
   approaches, including Hill numbers, machine learning, and phylogenetic
   comparative frameworks. Our results show that phylosymbiosis is one of
   the main mechanisms driving microbiota dissimilitude across species and
   specific microbiota diversity traits. Additionally, the microbial pool
   in each region was geographically differentiated, shaped by the rodent
   community ensemble, while ecological filtering rendered a microbial pool
   characteristic of each species. The environment also played a
   significant role for some species like Heteromys gaumeri, while dietary
   habits showed a stronger signal for Oryzomys couesi. Rodents with more
   specialized habits like Ototylomys phyllotis (semi-arboreal, folivorous)
   had higher bacterial diversity. The abundance of eight bacterial
   families determined key differences of the gut microbiota which, in
   addition to phylogeny and geography, are associated with distinct diet
   and metabolic functions among rodents. Distinct metabolic functions were
   related, among others, to toxins metabolism and digestion of complex
   food components. Overall findings show that both evolutionary and
   ecological drivers influence these rodents gut microbial structure and
   composition.},

Title = {Bacteria from the Amphibian Skin Inhibit the Growth of Phytopathogenic

Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Postharvest diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi represent one of
   the main challenges in the agricultural industry, leading to significant
   losses in fruit production. Although chemical treatments have been
   widely used for the control of these pathogens, the emergence of
   resistant strains and concerns regarding food safety and environmental
   impact have driven the search for novel effective and eco-friendly
   alternatives, such as the use of biological control agents (BCAs).
   Previously, we demonstrated that bacteria isolated from frog skin
   inhibit the growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Based
   on these findings, in this study we aimed to investigate the biocontrol
   potential of three bacterial isolates obtained from the skin of the frog
   Craugastor fitzingeri. Dual culture assays showed that these bacteria
   strongly inhibited the mycelial growth of several postharvest fungal
   phytopathogens, including Penicillium digitatum, P. italicum, Alternaria
   alternata, Aspergillus niger, and Alternaria solani. This antagonistic
   activity was further confirmed through assays using bacterial filtrates
   (BFs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), effectively delaying or
   suppressing fungal development under in vitro conditions. Additionally,
   in vivo experiments on citrus fruits, tomato, and blueberry demonstrated
   that treatments with bacterial cell suspensions or BFs significantly
   reduced disease incidence caused by P. digitatum, A. alternata, and B.
   cinerea. However, no inhibitory effects were observed against Geotrichum
   citri-aurantii, Fusarium sp., Fusarium oxysporum, and Phytophthora
   capsici, suggesting a degree of specificity. Our findings highlight the
   potential of frog skin-associated bacteria as a novel source of BCAs for
   the sustainable management of postharvest diseases in fruits.},

Abstract = {Lycini are a species-rich tribe within the Lycinae, which are
   distributed across all biogeographic regions worldwide. Current
   classification of Lycini has been based exclusively on molecular
   evidence, and the North American species have been poorly represented.
   The placement of Lycomesus Zaragoza-Caballero \& Gonz \&
   aacute;lez-Ramirez, 2019 and Lyconotus Green, 1949 remains uncertain. In
   order to elucidate the phylogenetic position of these genera within the
   North American genera and to propose morphological characters that
   support them, we conducted phylogenetic analyses using parsimony and
   model-based approaches. Our morphology-based dataset included 91 adult
   characters from representatives of five genera and 33 species of the
   Lycini genera of the New and Old Worlds. We propose a new classification
   of the North American Lycini, consistent with the phylogenetic
   hypotheses. This includes the following taxa: Lycomesus
   Zaragoza-Caballero \& Gonz \& aacute;lez-Ramirez, 2019, Lyconotus Green,
   1949 stat. rev., Lycorectus Gonz \& aacute;lez-Ramirez \&
   Zaragoza-Caballero gen. nov., Neolycus Bourgeois, 1883 and Rhyncheros
   LeConte, 1881. Additionally, we provide a key and diagnoses for all
   North American Lycini genera, as well as the morphological characters of
   males and females that define these genera. Our results indicate the
   necessity for a phylogenetic analysis that incorporates South American
   Lycini. This will enable a more precise generic classification of
   American Lycini.},

Abstract = {We employ a Bayesian inference technique for discretely observed
   diffusion processes that arise as solutions of stochastic differential
   equations. Our aim is to estimate the parameters of the stochastic
   differential equation. To achieve this, we frame the estimation
   procedure as a missing data problem. In this framework, the complete
   dataset includes the theoretically continuous-time path between observed
   points. We propose augmenting the dataset and using a Gibbs sampler to
   derive Bayesian estimators for the parameters in cases where the
   diffusion process is observed discretely. The Gibbs sampler is
   integrated with a diffusion bridge simulation technique based on the
   Wiener chaos expansion. The methodology and its implementation are
   demonstrated through examples and simulation studies. We also present an
   application to actual data.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in three
   Asteraceae species in a temperate secondary forest},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {129},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonize plant roots, facilitating
   water absorption and the acquisition of nutrients essential for plant
   growth and reproduction. This association is present in all terrestrial
   ecosystems and is also common in secondary vegetation species. Despite
   their importance in various ecological processes in temperate forests,
   AMF patterns in the Asteraceae family, have been scarcely studied. There
   are few studies that explicitly link plant biological traits and
   seasonal edaphic variability to colonization dynamics. The objective of
   this research was to evaluate the existence of patterns in the
   arbuscular mycorrhizal association of three Asteraceae family species of
   secondary vegetation, Ageratina glabrata, Roldana angulifolia and
   Roldana barbajohannis, explained by some biological traits of the plant
   species and some edaphic factors of the site. Significant differences in
   AMF colonization were detected. Hyphae and spore colonization increased
   during the rainy season, while arbuscule frequency increased during the
   dry season. Generalized linear model results showed that species
   identity and its interaction with the site significantly affected plant
   height and coverage. R. barba-johannis exhibited a significant and
   positive correlation between coverage and arbuscule colonization.
   Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that fungal colonization was
   primarily associated with higher soil moisture, organic matter, and
   nutrient availability during the rainy season. Conversely, arbuscule
   colonization and plant growth during the dry season were related to
   light availability and ammonium levels. It was shown that AMF
   colonization of Asteraceae shrubs is strongly influenced by a
   combination of biological, edaphic and seasonal factors.},

Abstract = {Nyctinomops laticaudatus is an insectivorous bat distributed from Mexico
   to northern Argentina; however, it has few helminthological records. In
   the present study, we describe the helminth fauna of N. laticaudatus
   from the municipalities of Calcehtok and Hom \& uacute;n in the state of
   Yucat \& aacute;n, Mexico. Helminths were identified using morphological
   techniques (clearing, staining, and scanning electron microscopy). We
   generated 28S rRNA and COI genetic sequence data for each of the taxa
   when possible. The helminth fauna of N. laticaudatus consisted of 17
   taxa: seven trematodes, Brachylecithum rileyi, Euparadistomum sp.,
   Limatulum nanum, Phaneropsolidae gen. sp., Ochoterenatrema sp., Urotrema
   minuta, and Urotrema sp.; two cestodes, Vampirolepis cf. christensoni
   and Vampirolepis cf. phyllostomi; six nematodes, Aonchotheca pulchra,
   Anoplostrongylus allami sp. nov. Panti-May \& Digiani, Physaloptera sp.,
   Physocephalus sexalatus, Spirura mexicana, and Litomosoides sp.; and two
   acanthocephalans, Mediorhynchus sp. and Oncicola sp. All these taxa,
   except for Euparadistomum sp., Mediorhynchus sp. and Oncicola sp., were
   recorded in both municipalities. The new species is distinguished from
   its only congener, Anoplostrongylus paradoxus, by the number of portions
   of the cephalic vesicle of males (two vs. three), the shape of the
   proximal half of the gubernaculum (asymmetric vs. symmetric) and,
   especially, by the marked sexual dimorphism in the ridge number and
   development. Anoplostrongylus allami had the highest prevalence and
   intensity values. This study adds new seven helminthological records for
   N. laticaudatus and four for Mexico, including the description of a new
   nematode species. This study also provides genetic sequences for most of
   the helminths found in N. laticaudatus, which will be useful in future
   studies, as few bat helminths have available genetic information.},

Abstract = {In the near-horizon region, black holes exhibit an infinite-dimensional
   symmetry reminiscent of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs supertranslations. The
   conserved charges associated with this symmetry can be computed in
   gravitational theories of arbitrary spacetime dimension and involving
   curvature terms of any order. In Lovelock theory, for instance, these
   charges take the form of nested Lagrangian densities corresponding to
   topological invariants, each weighted by the supertranslation
   function-thus providing a natural generalization of the Wald entropy
   formula. In four dimensions, the computation of the supertranslation
   charge reduces to the evaluation of the Jackiw-Teitelboim action on the
   two-dimensional spacelike sections of the event horizon.},

Title = {Different circadian locomotor rhythms of two competing hermit crab
   species},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {210},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Circadian rhythms enable organisms to anticipate and adapt to daily
   environmental fluctuations. These rhythms are thought to have been
   shaped by natural selection in response to both abiotic factors and
   biotic interactions, including interspecific competition. The
   coexistence of ecologically similar species can promote the divergence
   of activity rhythms, allowing temporal partitioning that reduces
   agonistic encounters and minimizes competitive pressure, particularly
   benefiting the weaker competitor. We tested these ideas by considering
   the locomotor activity of two hermit crab species that compete for
   gastropod shells -Calcinus californiensis (dominant) and Clibanarius
   albidigitus (subordinate). We first determined whether activity rhythms
   are endogenously controlled by comparing individuals' locomotor activity
   patterns under a 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod (LD) to their activity
   under constant darkness (DD). We then compared the locomotor rhythms
   between species under the LD treatment to assess whether their activity
   patterns are differentiated. Circadian rhythms observed under the LD
   photoperiod were maintained under DD conditions, confirming the presence
   of self-sustained oscillations for both species; although, the rhythms
   amplitudes were reduced under DD. Both species increased their activity
   around sunset (Zeitgeber Time 10). Calcinus californiensis remained
   active until approximately ZT 13, exhibiting a crepuscular activity
   pattern, whereas Clibanarius albidigitus remained active throughout the
   night until sunrise (ZT 23), displaying a nocturnal activity pattern.
   This temporal separation is expected to reduce the likelihood of
   agonistic encounters, particularly around late night and sunrise when
   Cal. californiensis is inactive. Meanwhile, the increased movement of
   Cli. albidigitus could compensate for its weaker fighting ability by
   allowing it to be a better exploitation competitor. Our findings suggest
   that many generations of interspecific competition have driven the
   evolution of distinct activity rhythms, promoting species coexistence
   through temporal niche differentiation.},

Title = {Application of Multivariate Exponential Random Graph Models in Small
   Multilayer Networks: Latin America, Tariffs, and Importation},

Abstract = {This work is framed as an application of static and small exponential
   random graph models for complex networks in multiple layers. This
   document revisits the small network and exhibits its potential.
   Examining the bibliography reveals considerable interest in large and
   dynamic complex networks. This research examines the application of
   small networks (50,000 population) for analyzing global commerce,
   conducting a comparative graph structure of the tariffs, and importing
   multilayer networks. The authors created and described the scenario
   where the readers can compare the graph models visually, at a glance.
   The proposed methodology represents a significant contribution,
   providing detailed descriptions and instructions, thereby ensuring the
   operational effectiveness of the application. The method is organized
   into five distinct blocks (Bn) and an accompanying appendix containing
   reproduction notes. Each block encompasses a primary task and associated
   sub-tasks, articulated through a hierarchical series of steps. The most
   challenging mathematical aspects of a small network analysis pertain to
   modeling and sample selection (sel\_p). This document describes several
   modeling tasks that confirm that sel\_p = 10 is the best option,
   including modeling the edges and the convergence and covariance model
   parameters, modeling the node factor by vertex names, Pearson residual
   distributions, goodness of fit, and more. This method establishes a
   foundation for addressing the intricate questions derived from the
   established hypotheses. It provides eight model specifications and a
   detailed description. Given the scope of this investigation, a
   historical examination of the relationships between different network
   actors is deemed essential, providing context for the study of actors
   engaged in global trade. Various analytical perspectives (six),
   encompassing degree analyses, diameter and edges, hubs and authority,
   co-citation and cliques in mutual and collapse approaches, k-core, and
   clustering, facilitate the identification of the specific roles played
   by actors within the importation network in comparison to the tariff
   network. This study focuses on the Latin American and Caribbean region.},

Title = {Evolutionary increases in body size are linked to female pelvis
   evolution in response to habitat rather than reproduction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 23},
Abstract = {In female vertebrates, the pelvis plays a role in important biological
   processes including reproduction and locomotion, and its evolution is
   thus likely influenced by multiple selective pressures. Here, we used CT
   scans, 3D geometric morphometrics, and phylogenetic comparative methods
   to describe the evolution of the female pelvis of Sceloporus lizards,
   and to tease apart the relative importance of the evolution of
   live-bearing, arboreality, and allometry in altering pelvis shape. We
   found that the ancestral egg-laying species tended to exhibit
   dorsoventrally tall female pelvises, and that two of three clades of
   live-bearing Sceloporus evolved both larger body sizes and
   dorsoventrally flat, laterally wide female pelvises. Larger body sizes
   may have relaxed constraints on pelvis height, allowing these mostly
   terrestrial and rock-dwelling species to respond to selective forces
   that enhance crypsis or thermoregulation by evolving dorsoventrally
   flatter and laterally wider pelvises. In contrast, one large clade of
   live-bearing and arboreal species had dorsoventrally tall pelvises, like
   those of the ancestral egg-laying species. Again, evolutionary shifts to
   larger body sizes may have relaxed allometric constraints, allowing
   adaptive responses to arboreality that converge on those of terrestrial
   egg-layers. Further studies are needed in other taxa to determine the
   importance of larger body sizes and consequently relaxed allometric
   constraints in shaping other morphological features.},

Title = {First report of microcystin-producing benthic cyanobacteria in Mexican
   mountain rivers: polyphasic characterization and HPLC toxin detection},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {267},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The detection and characterization of cyanotoxins produced by benthic
   cyanobacteria in rivers is an understudied topic compared to cyanotoxins
   produced by planktonic cyanobacteria. Particularly, detection methods
   for cyanotoxin-producing species in Latin America and Mexico continue to
   focus primarily on microscopy, with relatively scarce molecular
   detection. Herein, we present the first study in Mexican rivers that
   identifies a population of the genus Tychonema as a producer of two
   variants of microcystins, MC-LR and MC-RR, through a polyphasic approach
   that includes the quantification of toxins by HPLC-UV. Likewise, two
   populations of Nostoc and Microcoleus were identified and, based on the
   identification of the anaC and mcyE genes via PCR, may be producers of
   anatoxins and microcystins, respectively; however, this production could
   not be confirmed in the HPLC-UV analysis. Active microcystins production
   was observed in eutrophic environments, while potential production was
   recorded in populations in oligotrophic environments. Therefore, the
   presence of producing strains in both types of environment cannot be
   ruled out. We propose that toxin production could be a mechanism of
   competition against other microorganisms that make up benthic mats,
   rather than a direct response to eutrophication. We also found that the
   percent coverage of toxic cyanobacterial mats is not always a reliable
   indicator of the amount of toxin produced. Microcoleus sp. showed a
   higher percent coverage in the river but was not toxic, while Tychonema
   sp. Produced significant amounts of MC-LR and MC-RR under the same
   culture conditions despite less coverage in the river. We strongly
   recommend the implementation of multiple techniques and methods for
   identifying populations of toxin-producing benthic cyanobacteria
   (CyanoHAMs) in Mexican rivers in order to validate the results and
   develop a prevention plan against their associated risks.},

Abstract = {In Mexico, few studies on the species of fleas associated with rodents
   in high mountain areas have been conducted, even though these mammals
   are mainly associated with these ectoparasites to a large extent, and it
   is a group of species that have a wide distribution and great diversity.
   The present study determined the diversity of ectoparasites (fleas) in
   rodents from a subalpine grassland within the Nevado de Toluca Flora and
   Fauna Protection Area, State of Mexico. Rodent sampling was carried out
   during the dry season (March and April) and rainy season (August and
   November) of 2017, at an elevation of 4,050 m above sea level. A total
   of 147 Sherman traps were set during three consecutive nights across
   both seasons. Fleas were collected from rodent hair and placed in 70\%
   ethanol in separate vials for each specimen. A total of 217 rodents of
   three different species were captured: Reithrodontomys megalotis,
   Peromyscus melanotis, and Microtus mexicanus. From the last two species
   a total of 117 Siphonaptera from three families, five genera
   (Hystrichopsylla, Ctenophthalmus, Plusaetis, Strepsylla, Rhadinopsylla),
   and seven species were obtained. Plusaetis sibynus was the most abundant
   species and the one that showed the highest prevalence in P. melanotis,
   the most abundant rodent. Of the flea species found, Ctenophthalmus
   tecpin and Strepylla villai were new records for the State of Mexico,
   and three species of the genus Plusaetis had not previously been
   reported for the Nevado de Toluca area.},

Title = {Recovery of carbon dynamics, soil nutrients and tree diversity during
   secondary succession within the tropical dry forests in the Yucata<acute
   accent>n Peninsula},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {394},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tropical forests influence the global carbon (C) cycle, with tropical
   dry forests comprising 40-50 \% of all total tropical forests, and the
   Neotropics contain more than half. Tropical dry forests have released
   significant amounts of C due to deforestation and degradation, yet they
   hold substantial potential for C sequestration in secondary vegetation
   and soils. While recovery rates and the impact of water availability on
   aboveground carbon stocks (AGC) and nutrients are well-studied, gaps
   remain in understanding key controls during secondary succession and
   their variation with water availability. Our study evaluates nutrient
   dynamics in the tropical dry forests of the Yucata<acute accent>n
   Peninsula by comparing two precipitation-defined forest types; tropical
   sub-deciduous forest (TsDF) and tropical deciduous forest (TDF). Using
   data from Mexico's National Forest Inventory and published soil studies,
   we removed pseudo-replicates through spatial and temporal aggregation,
   constructed chronosequences, and performed multivariate analyses and
   recovery curve modeling to assess changes in AGC, C sequestration, soil
   nutrients (C, nitrogen, phosphorus), and tree diversity. Our results
   show slower recovery of AGC and tree diversity in TsDF, while soil
   nutrients recover more rapidly in TDF. Aboveground C sequestration is
   influenced by nutrient co-limitation (C:N and C:P ratios), differing
   between TsDF and TDF. Secondary succession in tropical dry forests
   transitions from soil-dominated to vegetation-dominated processes, with
   edaphic resources playing a major role during early successional stages.
   Our findings suggest that integrating sustainable forest management with
   tree diversity conservation may offer promising pathways for enhancing C
   sequestration strategies in tropical dry forests.},

Title = {Neonative Diploid-Polyploid Hotspots of Paspalum notatum:
   Identifying Novel Genetic Diversity for Conservation in South America},
Journal = {GENES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Background: Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum), a key cultivated grass
   worldwide, includes both sexual diploid and apomictic tetraploid
   cytotypes. Finding new diploid populations is crucial for the species'
   genetic improvement and conservation. Objectives: We aimed to determine
   the ploidy levels of 168 P. notatum accessions from subtropical South
   America, analyze the geographic distribution of cytotype diversity, and
   identify new diploid zones. Methods: Using chromosome counts and flow
   cytometry, we georeferenced our data with existing literature to map
   cytotype distribution. Results: We discovered five previously unknown
   diploid centers in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, two of which
   resulted from the naturalization of diploid cultivars. One location
   hosted a mixed-ploidy population (diploid, tetraploid, and pentaploid),
   confirming ongoing hybridization. Our results show that human activity
   actively creates new centers of genetic diversity, serving as a dynamic
   source of raw material for crop resilience. These neonative
   diversification zones are not only of scientific interest but also
   vital, evolving hotspots for germplasm conservation. Conclusions: This
   study presents a new framework for understanding the interactions
   between crop and wild relatives and highlights the urgent need for
   conservation in the rapidly changing South American grasslands.},

Title = {Unstructured spatial gradients in anthropogenic landscapes drive
   contrasting rodent and bat metacommunities, underscoring the need for
   multiscale conservation planning},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances disrupt natural gradients, increasing
   environmental heterogeneity and creating spatially unstructured
   gradients. These changes alter habitat availability and connectivity,
   affecting species dispersal, isolating populations, and reshaping
   community structure through species redistribution, population
   increases, declines, or losses. Understanding these impacts at multiple
   scales is crucial for biodiversity conservation in Neotropical forests.
   Rodents and bats, highly abundant and speciose mammal groups with key
   ecological roles and contrasting ecological strategies, should be a
   research priority in anthropogenic gradients. This study examines
   spatial patterns and mechanisms underlying bat and rodent metacommunity
   structures along a Neotropical anthropogenic gradient. Over two years,
   we sampled bat and rodent communities at 13 sites in the tropical
   forests of Calakmul, Mexico. Contrasting metacommunity structures
   revealed key factors shaping species distribution in anthropogenic
   landscapes. Beta diversity was high and driven by species turnover.
   Rodents followed a Gleasonian structure, while bats exhibited a
   quasi-Clementsian pattern, with herbivorous and animalivorous bats
   responding differently. Rodents were more influenced by local habitat
   attributes, whereas bats were mainly structured by landscape-scale
   variables. Then, functionally diverse metacommunities exhibit high beta
   diversity due to species turnover, driven by species sorting, mass
   effects, and ecological drift. These processes may intensify under
   anthropogenic disturbance, leading to nested patterns, increased species
   isolation, stronger mass effects, heightened vulnerability in
   low-diversity metacommunities, and reduced resilience. These findings
   highlight the need for (1)integrated landscape-level conservation, (2)
   preserving diverse patches and secondary forests, and (3) avoiding
   oversimplified metacommunity models (v.g. analyzing a single spatial
   scale) that weaken predictive power and conservation planning.},

Abstract = {For astrobiological studies related to the chemical evolution of organic
   molecules, it is essential to establish a plausible geological context,
   either on early Earth or at another viable site within the solar system.
   Impactgenerated hydrothermal systems may have provided an ideal
   environment for prebiotic chemical reactions before the origin of life.
   In this study, we simulated the conditions of such systems using
   saponite, a clay mineral identified as a product of hydrothermal
   alteration in impact craters that once hosted hydrothermal activity.
   Adenine was chosen as the model organic molecule due to its biological
   relevance and its known abiotic formation, as evidenced by its detection
   in certain meteorites. The interaction between saponite and adenine was
   investigated by analyzing adsorption kinetics and isotherms, revealing
   that adsorption is favored at acidic pH (3.5), as under these
   conditions, approximately 97 \% of the adenine is adsorbed. The
   interaction between the molecule and the clay was observed through
   spectroscopic techniques such as XRD, FRX, Raman and ATR-FTIR, UV-vis
   spectrophotometry, and HPLC-UV chromatographic. Additionally,
   thermolysis experiments were conducted on aqueous adenine solutions and
   adenine-saponite mixtures. The results indicate that saponite plays a
   protective role, preventing adenine decomposition at temperatures
   ranging from 100 degrees C to 200 degrees C across a pH range of
   3.5-8.9. These processes are critical for astrobiology, as they
   demonstrate how some clay minerals could have concentrated and preserved
   prebiotic organic molecules on early Earth, Mars, or planetesimals,
   facilitating the emergence of life.},

Title = {Can octopus embryos and juveniles contend with heatwaves?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Heatwaves are emerging climatological threats intensifying by climate
   change, that pose unprecedented challenges to thermally sensitive marine
   species. This study investigated the physiological and metabolic
   responses of O. maya offspring to heatwave conditions, focusing on
   oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and survival. We simulated a
   critical scenario where females with an optimal thermal history (24
   degrees C) laid eggs at the onset of a heatwave, exposing the offspring
   to optimal (24 degrees C), intermediate (26 degrees C), or high (30
   degrees C) temperatures for the entire embryonic development (similar to
   45 days) and 30 days post-hatching. Embryos incubated at 30 degrees C
   showed altered morphometry (reduced mantle and arm lengths) and
   suppressed routine metabolic rates by the end of embryonic development.
   Among antioxidants analyzed, total glutathione (GSH) emerged as a key
   factor in mitigating oxidative stress, supporting previous observations
   suggesting a key role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) protection. We
   hypothesized that energy reallocation to stress defense mechanisms
   compromised developmental processes, resulting in smaller hatchlings
   with reduced survival and diminished factorial metabolic scope.
   High-resolution respirometry revealed mitochondrial dysfunction,
   including increased proton leak and reduced respiratory efficiency,
   exacerbating oxidative damage and impairing oxygen transport. While some
   juveniles exhibited metabolic plasticity and elevated ATP production,
   these responses were insufficient to counteract the long-term costs of
   thermal stress. These findings suggest that although optimal thermal
   history, as seen in upwelling zones, may offer temporary protection,
   prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures could severely compromise
   reproductive success and population sustainability.},

Title = {Morphological Characterization of the Sensilla from the Antennal
   Flagella, Maxillary Palps, and Aculei, and Electroantennogram Responses
   of Anastrepha obliqua (Diptera: Tephritidae) to Host Volatiles},
Journal = {NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY},

Abstract = {Insect chemoreception is essential for locating food, selecting
   oviposition sites, and detecting infochemicals. In tephritid fruit
   flies, chemosensory perception occurs primarily through sensilla on the
   antennal flagella, maxillary palps, and ovipositor. Identifying these
   sensilla provides insights into olfaction, which may lead to
   improvements in insect control measures. This study describes the
   morphology of sensilla in Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) using scanning
   electron microscopy, assesses their permeability to crystal violet and
   silver nitrate, and evaluates antennal electrophysiological responses
   (EAG) to host volatiles. Sensilla were classified into multiple types
   based on morphology and staining properties. The antennal flagella
   housed four types of sensilla (trichodea, basiconica, clavata, and
   coeloconica), whereas the sensory pit contained peg-like and
   coeloconica-like sensilla. Sensilla trichodea were silver
   nitrate-positive but refractory to crystal violet, whereas sensilla
   basiconica, clavata, and coeloconica were permeable to both stains,
   indicating olfactory function. Maxillary palps exhibited mechanosensory
   sensilla chaetica and olfactory sensilla basiconica; only sensilla
   basiconica were permeable to both stains. The aculeus contained
   bristle-like, peg-like, and campaniform sensilla, suggesting its role in
   mechanoreception and chemoreception. EAG recordings demonstrated that
   all tested volatiles elicited antennal responses, with no significant
   differences between sexes, except for propyl butyrate, which induced a
   stronger response in males. This is the first study to characterize the
   sensilla of the palps and ovipositor in Anastrepha species and provides
   a foundation for future olfactory and behavioural research.},

Title = {Holographic explorations of regular black holes in pure gravity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2025},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {It has been recently established in Phys. Lett. B861 (2025) 139260 that
   asymptotically flat black holes exist in pure gravity theories in
   dimension greater than four. We extend this result to asymptotically
   five dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes and perform bottom-up
   holographic explorations: Hawking-Page phase transitions, quasinormal
   modes of black holes providing decay times of excitations in the finite
   temperature conformal field theory and U-shaped string probes leading to
   the quark-antiquark potential in the dual field theory. The
   gravitational action contains a bared, negative cosmological constant
   and an Einstein-Hilbert term, supplemented by an infinite series of
   higher-curvature terms of the family known as Quasi-topological (QT)
   Lagrangians, leading to a lapse function in terms of infinite series
   which can be resumed to an analytic function for different coupling
   choices. The QT terms are defined as those satisfying a Birkhoff's
   theorem and possessing a holographic c-function, and exist at all orders
   in the curvature, for arbitrary dimension greater than four. Besides
   presenting the general formulae, we explore the physics of three
   specific cases leading to Hayward, Dymnikova and Bardeen-like regular
   black holes. We also found the field redefinition that permits recasting
   the alpha ` 3W4 correction of Type IIB supergravity on

Abstract = {Starting from a coarse-grained map of a quantum many-body system, we
   construct the inverse map that assigns a microscopic state to a
   coarse-grained state based on the maximum entropy principle. Assuming
   unitary evolution in the microscopic system, we examine the resulting
   dynamics in the coarse-grained system using the assignment map. We
   investigate both a two-qubit system, with SWAP and controlled-NOT gates,
   and n-qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with
   all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit
   atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity.
   Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial
   coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic
   dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics
   induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems
   diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this
   approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and
   provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum
   systems.},

Title = {Direct-photon production in in elastic and high-multiplicity
   proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV},

Abstract = {In this letter, we present the first measurement of direct photons at
   the transverse momentum of 1 < p(T) < 6 GeV/c at midrapidity in
   inelastic and high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at a
   centre-of-mass energy of root s = 13 TeV. The fraction of virtual direct
   photons in the inclusive virtual photon spectrum is obtained from a fit
   to the dielectron invariant mass spectrum. In the limit of zero
   invariant mass, this fraction is equal to the relative contribution of
   real direct photons in the inclusive real photon spectrum. Contributions
   from decays of light-flavour neutral mesons are estimated using
   independent measurements in proton-proton collisions at the same energy
   and the same event class. For the first time at the LHC energies, a
   direct-photon signal is observed at low p(T) in both inelastic and
   high-multiplicity event classes, with a significance of 3.2 sigma and
   1.9 sigma in terms of standard deviations, correspondingly. The yield of
   direct photons in inelastic pp collisions is compared to perturbative
   QCD calculations. The integrated photon yield is studied as a function
   of charged-particle multiplicity and is compared to the results from
   other experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show a
   significant increase of direct-photon yield with charged-particle
   multiplicity.},

Abstract = {The distribution of angular correlations between prompt charm hadrons
   and primary charged particles in pp collisions is sensitive to the
   charm-quark hadronisation process. In this letter, charm-baryon
   correlations are measured for the first time by studying the
   azimuthal-angle difference between charged particles and prompt
   Lambda(+)(c) baryons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass
   energy of root s=13 TeV, with the ALICE detector. Lambda(+)(c) baryons
   are reconstructed at midrapidity (|y|<0.5) in the transverse-momentum
   interval 3<p(T)<16 GeV/c, and correlated with charged particles with
   p(T)>0.3 GeV/c and pseudorapidity |eta|<0.8. For 3<p(T)(Lambda c+,D)<5
   GeV/c, the comparison with published measurements of D-meson and
   charged-particle correlations in the same collision system hints at a
   larger number of low-momentum particles associated with
   Lambda(+)(c)-baryon triggers than with D-meson triggers, both in the
   collinear and opposite directions with respect to the trigger particle.
   These differences can be quantified by the comparison of the properties
   of the near- and away-side correlation peaks, and are not reproduced by
   predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, generally
   underpredicting the associated particle yields at p(T)(assoc)<1 GeV/c.
   This tension between Lambda(+)(c)-baryon and D-meson associated peak
   yields could suggest a modified fragmentation of the charm quark, or a
   different hadronisation process, when a charm baryon is produced in the
   final state.},

Abstract = {Chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a
   major emerging disease contributing to the global decline of amphibians.
   Phenotypic variations in Bd, such as zoosporangia size and zoospore
   production, may be linked to differences in pathogenicity among isolates
   and adaptation to temperatures. Bd has been detected in various regions
   in Mexico, but its phenotypic variability and relationship to
   pathogenicity remain unexplored. Here, we examine phenotypic
   characteristics of Bd such as the growth rate, carrying capacity,
   zoospore production, and zoosporangia size of ten Bd isolates
   representing different sublineages within the Bd Global Panzootic
   Lineage, collected from diverse temperature regimes in Mexico. We found
   high phenotypic variability between isolates, with growth rate and
   zoosporangia size influenced by the environmental temperature of their
   respective sites. Other traits, such as carrying capacity and zoospore
   production, did not show clear patterns related to environmental
   temperature. Our findings provide insights into the phenotypic
   variability of Bd in Mexico and highlight the complexity of
   pathogen-environment interactions suggesting local adaptations.},

Title = {A Reptile Feast: Diet of the Collared Forest-Falcon in a Tropical Dry
   Forest of Western Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {.-Knowledge of raptor diets is crucial for understanding predator-prey
   dynamics and avian ecology. However, for the widely distributed Collared
   Forest-Falcon (Micrastur semitorquatus), little is known of the species'
   diet in the northern part of its distributional range. We determined the
   diet of the Collared Forest-Falcon in the tropical dry forest of western
   Mexico by direct observations of prey deliveries during 80 hr of video
   recordings at eight nests over two breeding seasons (2021-2022) and by
   identifying prey bone remains in an additional nest cavity in a fallen
   tree. We observed 28 prey deliveries from videos and field observations
   and identified 298 prey bone remains. Both methods highlighted the
   predominance of reptiles (82.1\%, n = 23 observations; 57.1\%, n = 170
   bone remains), particularly large-bodied iguanas, in the diet of nesting
   Collared Forest-Falcons in tropical dry forest. Birds composed 38.9\% (n
   = 116) of prey bone remains and 10.7\% (n = 3) of observations. The West
   Mexican Chachalaca (Ortalis poliocephala), the largest cracid in the
   region, was the most common avian prey, although direct observations
   detected significantly fewer avian prey than found in prey remains.
   Mammals made up little of the prey (7\%, n = 2 observations; 4\%, n = 12
   bone remains) and consisted mostly of Virginia opossum (Didelphis
   virginiana), but included at least two individuals of the endangered
   Magdalena woodrat (Xenomys nelsoni), a micro-endemic species. Our
   results differ from previous studies that found a predominance of
   mammalian and avian prey in Collared Forest-Falcon diets and elucidate
   dietary variations of the species throughout its distribution.},

Abstract = {We construct the vector field associated with the GKLS generator for
   systems described by Gaussian states . This vector field is defined on
   the dual space of the algebra of operators, restricted to operators
   quadratic in position and momentum. It is shown that the GKLS dynamics
   accepts a decomposition principle, that is, this vector field can be
   decomposed into three parts: a conservative Hamiltonian component, a
   gradient-like component, and a Choi-Kraus or jump vector field. The last
   two terms are considered ``perturbations{''} associated with
   dissipation. Examples are presented for a harmonic oscillator with
   different dissipation terms.},

Title = {Threshold depth for girdling-induced mortality in Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis: a predictive approach for invasive species management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {391},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Invasive species, such as Eucalyptus camaldulensis, pose significant
   ecological challenges in protected areas worldwide due to their
   environmental impacts and complex management. This study aimed to
   determine the threshold depth of girdling necessary to induce mortality
   in E. camaldulensis and to develop a predictive model for its practical
   application in invasive species management. Two populations of E.
   camaldulensis girdled in 2010 and 2017, along with a control group, were
   monitored for survival, decline, and phenological responses over one
   year. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards
   models revealed that girdling depth was the most significant factor
   affecting tree mortality, with a critical threshold of 6.55 cm. Trees
   girdled below this depth showed significantly higher survival rates. A
   positive linear relationship was identified between tree breast height
   circumference, and the minimum girdling depth required for mortality,
   enabling the development of a predictive model. Girdled trees exhibited
   a significant reduction in fruit and young leaf production, along with
   an increase in mature leaves and tree decline, compared to control
   trees. These findings provide a science-based and sustainable approach
   for managing E. camaldulensis populations in protected areas. The
   proposed model offers a practical tool for estimating the necessary
   girdling depth based on tree size, minimizing the use of chemical inputs
   and promoting adaptive management. This approach ensures targeted and
   efficient control of this invasive species, enhancing the conservation
   of native ecosystems.},

Title = {Analysis of errors in corneal topography evaluation caused by distortion
   aberration in the camera lens of a cone corneal topographer},
Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {We study the effects on corneal topography when the topographer camera
   is affected by distortion aberration, causing a nonuniform magnification
   in the image recorded by the camera sensor. As a result, images present
   a size change which could mislead the interpretation vertex position of
   the anterior corneal surface. Images numerically generated and distorted
   using the Seidel's aberrations are used to carry the analysis. According
   to the results presented in this paper, while the reconstruction
   algorithm accurately recovers the central region surface, there are
   pronounced deviations between the retrieved surface and the actual
   surface towards the periphery. These deviations lead to the
   underestimation or overestimation of the parameters associated with the
   base surface for a contact lens, affecting the correction of refractive
   errors such as myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism. Moreover, if the
   corneal topography provided by a topographer affected distortion
   aberration is used for corneal reshaping via laser ablation, the
   refractive errors might be overcorrected or undercorrected. this paper
   highlights the importance of performing a proper calibration procedure
   for the distortion aberration of the corneal topographer camera, in
   order to reliably recover an accurate corneal topography.},

Abstract = {Persicarla nepalensis is an important invasive plant that is spreading
   in many locations across the globe. In Mexico, it was first reported in
   2005; however, the species has not been studied since the first arrival
   report. Therefore, the aim of this article is to report new observations
   of the plant and analyze the citizen science reports to evaluate the
   current status of this species in Mexico. We used data from the GBIF
   database and analyzed the number of reports historically, during the
   year, and the current geographical distribution. We also collected a
   specimen in a new location. We found that the number of observations is
   increasing over time and that the distribution area of this plant is
   already at least 79,681 km2. Most observations were made in the autumn,
   suggesting that this is the main flowering time. We conclude that the
   invasive plant is spreading across Mexico and that the window of
   opportunity for eradication of the species is closed. Therefore,
   mitigation plans should be prepared.},

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {96},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Richness patterns result from the geographic overlap of multiple
   species' ecological niches. Phylogenetic niche conservatism and
   dispersal are essential processes for understanding species richness
   patterns. We update the theory on the biotic assembly of the Mexican
   Transition Zone (MTZ) by including the phylogenetic niche conservatism
   concept. This theory refers to the concept of cenocron (pool of lineages
   of the same biogeographic affinity, sharing the same history and time of
   dispersal) to explain species richness gradients. We review the
   phylogenetic niche conservatism foundations, the statements of the MTZ
   theory on biotic assembly, and their relationship to other hypotheses
   proposed to explain geographical richness gradients to compare the
   predictions derived for the MTZ gradients. We present a guide of
   methodological possibilities to assess phylogenetic niche conservatism
   by applying the phylogenetic comparative method. We provide an overview
   of the available techniques and software, how to input the data and
   other requisites for their implementation and show examples of their
   application in the MTZ.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2025},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coral reefs in the Mexican Pacific coast have been significantly
   impacted by the El Ni \& ntilde;o events in the last decades. During
   2015 and 2023, two severe events caused several key coral stress
   indicators related to sea surface temperature reaching record highs (SST
   congruent to 32.68 degrees C, DHW congruent to 16.66, ONI = 2.6),
   resulting in a devastating response across all coral populations of
   Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. The composition of the substrate changed
   significantly over a 15-year period (ANOSIM, R = 0.489, p = 0.001). High
   levels of live coral cover were recorded in 2010 (56.35\% +/- 38.25\%),
   followed by high cover of bleached corals during the 2015 El Ni \&
   ntilde;o event (up to 31.89\% +/- 20.98\%), then pale corals in 2023 (up
   to 61.33\% +/- 21.39\%), and finally, near-total cover of dead coral in
   2024 (86.67\% +/- 9.02\%). Significant changes in algae cover were
   observed at sites that were still relatively healthy prior to the 2023
   El Ni \& ntilde;o, showing a clear regime shift from reefs dominated by
   healthy corals to completely dominated by algae after this event. The
   future of these reefs is now uncertain, especially given the lack of
   recovery observed from coral losses sustained during the 2015 event.
   Increased conservation efforts for surviving coral populations along the
   Mexican Pacific coast, coupled with enhanced monitoring of coral
   recruitment, are crucial. Carbonate budget monitoring methods, such as
   Reef Budget, could prove invaluable in tracking the trajectory of change
   in these reefs.},

Title = {A long-term multiparametric analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate
   responses to anthropogenic stressors, including a novel multimetric

   Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},

Abstract = {Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., urbanization,
   agriculture) on riparian ecosystems is key to their sustainable
   management. The use of multimetric indices (MMIs) based on biological
   assemblages for assessing such pressures has increased worldwide. Their
   cost-benefit advantage and the scientific rigor of their development
   make them efficient bioindication tools for ecosystem diagnosis and
   conservation. This research aimed to develop an MMI for the Basin of
   Mexico based on the assemblages of benthic macroinvertebrates (MIB)
   observed through sampling perennial rivers and springs at 77 sites over
   a ten-year period. Potential sites were identified from extant
   government maps and then visited to verify their current state or
   existence compared to these cartographic records. We began with 80
   ecological metrics and filtered these to remove redundancy, evaluating
   their ability to differentiate between conserved and degraded sites,
   have temporal stability, adjusting their score values to natural
   environmental gradients using significant residual values of the MIB
   metrics at reference sites. Furthermore, the degree of correlation
   between environmental changes due to anthropogenic activities at the
   local and catchment scales was assessed. The final MMI was constructed
   based on five metrics: Total Abundance, Diptera Richness, Crawler
   Richness, \% Scrapers, and \% Temporarily Attached Organisms. The index
   showed significant differences when discriminating between conserved and
   degraded sites, as well as when responding to environmental changes at
   the local and catchment scales. The implemented MMI demonstrates
   methodological replicability, efficiency, and the potential of
   macroinvertebrate assemblages to be used as bioindicators in Mexico and
   other countries where aquatic ecosystems are under constant pressures
   from land-use change.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in global plastic production has accelerated the
   dissemination of microplastics (MP), impacting urban and coastal
   environments. This study quantifies and categorizes MP in two major
   Mexican ports: Veracruz (Gulf of Mexico) and Manzanillo (Pacific Ocean).
   Nine polymer types were identified through micro-Fourier Transform
   Infrared Spectroscopy (micro-FTIR) analysis of air and seawater samples.
   Polyester (PES) was the most prevalent polymer, followed by acrylic
   polymers (ACR) and polyethylene (PE). At Veracruz, the airborne MP
   concentrations were 3.9 (1.9) MP m-3 in the morning and 2.2 (1.4) MP m-3
   in the afternoon. In Manzanillo, morning and afternoon concentrations
   were 3.2 (1.8) MP m-3 and 2.6 (1.6) MP m-3, respectively. Surface
   concentrations of marine MP were elevated near the coast, averaging
   approximately 14.4 (1.4) MP m-3. Additionally, artificial non-plastic
   particles (ANPP) were identified and were even more abundant than MP in
   both matrices. In all locations and matrices, fibers constituted at
   least 70 \% of detected MP, while fragments comprised the remainder.
   Identified MP ranged in size (equivalent diameter) from 82 mu m to 160
   mu m. The observed variations in MP composition and concentrations
   across sites, depths, and sampling times underscore the significant
   influence of proximity to port activities and local meteorological
   conditions. Furthermore, these findings provide compelling evidence
   supporting the transfer of MP from the ocean to the atmosphere via
   ocean-atmosphere interactions. These baseline data will inform targeted
   management and risk-assessment frameworks for Mexican coastal regions.},

Title = {A mathematical model for strategic management of the forest supply chain
   considering its products and energy generation},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {178},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Historically, forestry supply chains have operated in a disjointed
   manner, leading to insufficient coordination between forest management
   and wood processing in their planning and operations. In addition,
   generating energy using the available resources of the forestry activity
   has been largely considered a secondary activity, with slight
   synchronization with the remaining chain. However, currently,
   comprehensive supply chain integration is essential for guaranteeing the
   economic sustainability of forest supply chains. This article presents a
   multi-period mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for forest
   resource management, covering everything from harvesting to energy
   generation. It considers supply chain planning, customer selection, and
   both internal and external raw material sources. The model considers
   transportation costs, production limits, and the use of specific
   equipment for processing biomass and industrial waste. Importantly, it
   includes bioenergy generation, highlighting its economic advantages and
   role in the overall management of forest supply chains. Analysis of a
   real-world case from Misiones, Argentina, reveals that meeting wood
   demand consistently necessitates the exploitation of external forest
   stands. Moreover, the integration of on-site waste processing equipment
   within the stands proves economic benefits for the supply chain, whereas
   incorporating units for processing pulpable logs yields a comparatively
   smaller economic return. Notably, the study indicates that satisfying
   potential increases in energy demand is largely contingent on the
   availability of waste from external sawmills. However, in instances
   where external sawmill waste is scarce, the plant maintains operational
   continuity by utilizing alternative byproducts, such as forest biomass
   chips, which are typically designated for sale.},

Abstract = {This ethnobotanical study, conducted in rural settler and Guarani
   populations sharing similar environments within the Yabot \& iacute;
   Biosphere Reserve's area of influence in Misiones, Argentina, analyzes
   and compares local firewood utilization practices and the landscape
   associated with these practices. We surveyed the general characteristics
   of the managed landscapes, categorized the observed environments
   according to management intensity, identified firewood collection
   environments, and measured the distance of these environments from the
   peridomestic space. Furthermore, we compared the strategies employed for
   firewood selection and the acquisition methods. Using ethnobotanical
   techniques and statistical analysis, we identified relationships between
   ecological and sociocultural variables and groupings of firewood species
   with their ecological attributes. The results show that both groups
   shape the landscape through productive activities, primarily
   agriculture, and manage resources differently based on their cultural
   characteristics, socioeconomic profile, and energy needs. Differences
   were found in collection strategies and environments. Settlers cut
   green, native, and exotic species into more distant locations, while the
   Guaranies collect fallen, dry, native species near their homes. Settlers
   use mechanical tools to extract large-sized species, while the Guaranies
   employ manual tools for cutting and gathering. Resource and environment
   management are guided by cultural requirements and specific decisions to
   control resource availability. The study highlights the importance of
   understanding traditional practices for the sustainable management of
   woody resources.},

   Urban Green Spaces: A Case Study from Mexico City},
Journal = {BIRDS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {6},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Urbanization affects bird communities by reducing habitat and
   fragmenting ecosystems. Urban parks can help counteract these effects.
   However, anthropogenic noise can further alter bird composition. We
   examined the distribution and abundance of bird species in nine urban
   parks in Mexico City. We used a ten minute fixed-radius (25 m)
   point-counting technique to count birds along their annual cycle, with
   ten minutes allocated for bird counts. The quality of green areas was
   analyzed in terms of vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index), park size, and mean noise level dB(A) (based on MIN and MAX
   values), and species were grouped into trophic guilds. A total of 108
   bird species were recorded, 5 of which are under special protection; we
   grouped all species into 14 trophic guilds, showing different responses
   to environmental gradients. Redundancy analysis (RDA) explained 89.98\%
   of the variance, with noise and park size being the most influential
   variables. Granivores and omnivores were more tolerant to noise, while
   insectivores and frugivores preferred quieter areas with more
   vegetation. A positive association was observed between the presence of
   winter resident species and the park size. On the other hand, mean noise
   level dB(A) was negatively related to permanent resident species, winter
   resident species, and those with protected status. Conservation efforts
   should focus on maintaining ample green spaces and reducing noise
   pollution, as recorded high mean noise levels (>53 dB(A)) exceed the
   recommended thresholds for avifauna conservation.},

Title = {Movement ecology and conservation of capuchin monkeys in pine plantation
   landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {309},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Pine plantations significantly alter wildlife spatial ecology, yet some
   arboreal mammals, particularly primates, persist in these landscapes.
   Some primates may bark-strip pines, generating conflicts with producers,
   further threatening their populations. Black capuchin monkeys (Sapajus
   nigritus), endemic to the Atlantic Forest, inhabit both native forests
   and plantation-dominated landscapes. Here we studied the effect of pine
   plantations on movement and space use pattern of capuchins. Using data
   from 2008 to 2024, we applied Hidden Markov Models and Auto-correlated
   Kernel Density Estimators to study movements and space use of 11
   capuchin groups in northeastern Argentina, comparing pine plantations
   and protected forests. Capuchins in plantations traveled longer daily
   distances. In plantations, stationary movement state, linked to resting
   and feeding, were more frequent in forest fragments, while rapid
   directional movements prevailed in pine stands. Stationary movements
   increased in pine stands during peak bark-stripping periods. Home ranges
   in plantations nearly tripled those in protected forests. Core areas in
   plantation landscapes were highly concentrated in native forest
   fragments. Despite fragments constituting only 22 \% of the plantation
   landscape, they concentrated 95 \% of sleeping sites, shaping capuchins'
   daily movements. Resource scarcity and fragmentation increase capuchins'
   daily trajectories, home ranges, and core areas, likely reducing
   carrying capacity. Preserving forest fragments and ensuring their
   connectivity is essential to maintaining habitat quality for primates in
   plantation landscapes. Movement ecology insights from capuchins in pine
   plantations are key for conservation planning with the aim of developing
   primate-friendly production landscapes, and mitigating conflicts between
   primates and foresters.},

Abstract = {Severe weather in airports represents a latent hazard to the population
   and economy. Meteorological hazards, such as hailstorms and
   thunderstorms, significantly impact airport operations worldwide,
   including in Mexico. In this context, the present research analyses the
   spatial and temporal characteristics of thunderstorms and hailstorms in
   57 airports distributed throughout the Mexican territory. To this end,
   METAR and SPECI data were employed to obtain the general
   characteristics, frequency, and severity of thunderstorms and hailstorms
   from 1990 to 2020. Then, using the ERA5 reanalysis data, diverse
   thermodynamic, kinematic, and composite parameters of the pre-convective
   environments are analyzed. Furthermore, using the K-means clustering
   method, such environments were classified. In this sense, three types of
   thunderstorm environments in Mexican airports were identified, each one
   with particular characteristics: Coastal Thunderstorms (CoaT), Northeast
   Thunderstorms (NorT), and Continental Thunderstorms (ConT). Likewise,
   three hailstorm types were identified: Highlands Hailstorms (HigH),
   Coastal Hailstorms (CoaH), and Central-Region Hailstorms (CenH). This
   research provides valuable insights into the severe weather conditions
   at Mexican airports, which can be utilized to enhance their forecasting
   capabilities and mitigate associated losses. Additionally, they help
   characterize the environments in which these phenomena developed and
   generate a baseline that can be used in future studies to analyze the
   impact of climate change on severe weather.},

Title = {Increasing the knowledge of medicinal flora of the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca,
   the case of Santiago Huauclilla},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {352},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Ethnobotanical relevance: Mexico ranks second in the world in the number
   of recognized medicinal plants. Unfortunately, despite important
   advances in the knowledge of the flora of Mexico, specifically the
   medicinal flora, this knowledge of the flora may still be incomplete.
   Aim of the study: The purpose of this work is to find evidence that will
   allow us to know if the medicinal flora of the Mixteca Alta has been
   sufficiently documented through the ethnobotanical study of Santiago
   Huauclilla as a case of study. Material and methods: Open and
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 people from Santiago
   Huauclilla, selected by snowball sampling. Using ethnobotanical data
   from Santiago Huauclilla, among other places, a data matrix was
   constructed to analyze the inventory of the medicinal flora of the
   Mixteca Alta. A Species Accumulation Curve and a Cluster Analysis were
   performed to compare the medicinal flora of nine communities of the
   Mixteca Alta. Results: Information on 94 species of medicinal plants
   from 44 botanical families for Santiago Huauclilla was integrated. Oral
   administration and preparation as a decoction of leaves and aerial parts
   were the most common forms of use of these medicinal species. From this
   study, 41 species were added to the medicinal flora of the Mixteca Alta,
   with 22 new records of medicinal flora for the state of Oaxaca. Thus,
   the inventory for the Mixteca Alta reached 292 species, of which more
   than 50 \% are exclusive to a single community. Conclusion: According to
   the research on medicinal plants in the case of Santiago Huauclilla and
   some other communities of the Mixteca Alta, it is confirmed that the
   inventory of the medicinal flora of this region of the state of Oaxaca
   is still incomplete and requires the continuity of this type of
   ethnobotanical studies to rescue and preserve the ancestral knowledge of
   popular medicine that still supports indigenous and rural communities.},

Title = {Impacts of marine heatwaves on disturbed mangrove ecosystems: A
   biomarker-based assessment using fiddler crabs as sentinel species},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {285},
Number = {5},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) pose severe threats to coastal ecosystems.
   Fiddler crabs, key intertidal species in mangrove environments, are
   particularly vulnerable to MHWs in disturbed habitats, where vegetation
   degradation amplifies environmental stressors such as temperature and
   salinity. We conducted a biomarker-based assessment of the behavioral,
   physiological, and biochemical responses of fiddler crab species to MHWs
   in undisturbed and disturbed mangrove ecosystems. We also used a
   laboratory-based simulation of MHWs to investigate how environmental
   stressors (elevated temperature, salinity, and hypoxia) trigger
   behavioral responses of species in degraded habitats. Our findings
   reveal water escape and aggregation behaviors in crabs inhabiting
   disturbed mangroves during maximum high tide (MHW) events. These
   responses were triggered when burrow temperatures approached crabs'
   critical thermal maximum, suggesting a thermally induced escape
   mechanism. Crabs aggregating above the water level exhibited significant
   osmotic disruption, including a pronounced loss of osmoregulatory
   capacity, which heightened their vulnerability to desiccation. These
   physiological impairments were accompanied by signs of neuromuscular
   dysfunction, as indicated by altered acetylcholinesterase activity. In
   contrast, crabs from undisturbed mangrove habitats did not exhibit such
   behavioral or physiological disruptions. The laboratory experiments
   further demonstrated that the likelihood of escape and aggregation
   behaviors increased at lower temperatures under high-salinity and
   low-oxygen-concentration conditions. These results suggest that
   undisturbed mangrove habitats act as thermal refuges, mitigating the
   extreme effects of MHWs on the intertidal fauna.},
