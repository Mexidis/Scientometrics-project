Abstract = {Quercus affinis and Q. laurina are two closely related Mexican red oaks
   with partially overlapping distributions. Within the area of overlap,
   there are localities where morphological intergradation occurs. A
   previous hypothesis explained this pattern as a result of secondary
   contact between the two species, followed by hybridization and
   introgression. This possibility was analyzed here by examining foliar
   and genetic variation in 16 localities situated along a macrogeographic
   gradient, which included morphologically representative populations of
   both species and populations from within the area of overlap.
   Maximum-likelihood hybrid index scores calculated from nine
   semi-diagnostic RAPD markers indicated a shift in the genetic
   composition of populations from one species to the other along the
   macrogeographic gradient, with genetically intermediate populations
   situated in the area of overlap. Foliar variation followed a partially
   congruent pattern, but Q. laurina-like morphology predominated in some
   of the genetically intermediate populations. There were several
   instances of correlated frequency changeovers of single RAPD markers and
   morphological characters along the macrogeographic gradient and a few
   cases of markedly parallel patterns between markers. The results were
   interpreted as consistent with a hypothesis of secondary contact between
   the two oak species that has resulted in some differential introgression
   among markers.},

Abstract = {Ribosomes, ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), and messenger and transfer
   RNAs catalyze the synthesis of proteins in organisms. To understand and
   define the components involved in this event in Taenia solium, we
   isolated and characterized a T. solium cDNA encoding the basic ribosomal
   protein S15a (TsS15a). The TsS15a cDNA produces a protein with M-r
   (relative molecular mass) 14,988, which contains 22.3\% of basic amino
   acids. Analysis comparing TsS15a protein with other S15a r-proteins
   indicates that this protein is highly conserved. A recombinant TsS15a
   protein with similar M-r was produced in bacteria. Antibodies against
   recombinant TsS15a react with a 15-kDa protein in extracts from all life
   stages of T. solium and from all helminths tested. Hybridization studies
   showed the presence of two genes encoding a mRNA of 0.5 kb. Moreover,
   the gene presents an intron of 30 bp. Our phylogenetic analysis using
   S15a r-proteins reproduced the topologies reported for 16/18S rRNA.},

Abstract = {Epiphytes are one of the most ubiquitous elements of tropical forest
   canopies, including seasonally dry tropical forests. Given the temporal
   variation in weather conditions in the latter, epiphyte populations may
   be subject to wide temporal variation in seedling recruitment,
   reproductive success, vegetative propagation and mortality rate. In this
   study, we use a 3-y demographic data set for Tillandsia brachycaulos to
   project its long-term population dynamics through the use of average and
   periodic matrices, as well as stochastic simulations. The results show
   that demographic behaviour varied over the 3 years of study, apparently
   in relation to rainfall. The first 2 years yielded a low lambda value
   (0.79 and 0.80 - although only the former was significantly lower than
   unity), while the third year resulted in a lambda = 1.08 (not
   significantly different from 1.0). When incorporating this demographic
   variation in an average matrix, a periodic matrix and stochastic
   simulations, the resulting overall lambda was below unity in all three
   cases. The projections of the stochastic simulations suggest that the
   population would be able to persist in the long run only if the
   frequency of `good' years (defined here as those with an August rainfall
   above 200 mm) was above 0.6, which appears unlikely given that global
   warming might result in a lower frequency of rainy years in tropical dry
   forests.},

Abstract = {The conventional w/w(+) eye assay in Drosophila has been used for the
   last 10 years for genotoxic evaluation of a broad number of chemicals
   with different mechanisms of action. Although chemicals that induce
   genotoxic effects by mechanisms other than covalent binding to DNA are
   difficult to detect. The aim of this study was the parallel detection of
   both mitotic recombination and X chromosome loss induced by five
   chemical compounds used worldwide as antineoplastic drugs using the
   w/w(+) somatic assay in Drosophila melanogaster. The compounds tested
   were the intercalating agent adriamycin (AD), the alkylating compound
   chlorambucil (CAB) and the spindle poisons demecolcine (DEM), paclitaxel
   (taxol, TX) and vinblastine (VBL). We used a cross between heterozygous
   females with a rod-X and a ring-X chromosome mated with ywf males. All
   four genotypes in the next generation are heterozygous or hemizygous for
   the w(+) reporter gene and were inspected for the occurrence of white
   clones in their compound eyes. We found differences in the induction of
   mitotic recombination when compared with chromosome loss. Genotoxic
   profiles obtained for the antineoplastic drugs studied indicate direct
   and indirect effects. While AD seems to be clastogenic due to its
   induction of X chromosome loss in XrX females; DEM, CAB and TX produced
   both structural chromosome aberrations through clastogenic activities
   and mitotic recombination through DNA interactions; the cytotoxic VBL
   induced rX loss only in XrY and intra-chromosomal recombination (XY)
   males, probably due to sister strand recombination, generating a
   w(+)w(+) duplication and a w(-) deletion, forward mutations or small
   deletions at the white locus.},

Abstract = {Red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) hinds were confined before
   parturition in 20 x 30 m earth-floored pens and offered freshly cut
   legume-grass mixed pasture (Experiment 1) or lucerne hay (Experiment 2).
   In Experiment 1, four hinds were placed in a single pen; all
   parturitions took place within 24 h. Animals were monitored by a single
   observer for 24-h periods twice weekly for 10 weeks. Number of daily
   suckling episodes increased with age while their duration decreased.
   Consumption of forage started around the fourth week and, by weaning,
   calves had spent an average of 105.5 min eating forage and 44.2 min
   ruminating daily, compared with hinds, which consumed forage for 6.05 h
   and ruminated for 1.77 h per day. In Experiment 2, 24 hinds and their
   calves were confined in four pens for 12 weeks. Four observers each
   monitored the activities of a randomly chosen calf from 0800 to 1330 h
   and from 1430 to 2000 h. Activities were analysed as proportions of
   total activity using linear and quadratic regressions. Time spent
   suckling increased until Day 26 (110 seconds, in a total of three
   bouts), decreasing to 13 seconds (in a total of eight bouts) by Day 73.
   Most of the hinds (70\%) allonursed (nursing a calf other than its own),
   some as soon as 2 days post-partum. Forage consumption by the calves
   decreased from 37.1 s at 8 days to 12.6 and 17.1 s at 59 and 73 days,
   respectively. The regression equation for time spent suckling
   (proportion of total activity) against calf age (days) showed a
   quadratic effect: y = 0.76 - 0.026 day + 0.00023 day(2) (R(2) = 0.797),
   whilst time spent eating forage showed an opposite quadratic trend: y =
   -0.17 + 0.28 day - 0.0002 day(2) (R(2) = 0.761).},

Abstract = {Blood metabolites in wild and seventh-generation cultivated shrimp were
   measured to determine how size-based selection could alter the
   nutritional and immunological conditions of Litopenaeus vannamei. Wild
   L. vannamei juveniles and a sample of seventh-generation cultured shrimp
   were acclimated under identical conditions. During 55 days, shrimp were
   fed a high (HCHO: 44\%) or a low (LCHO: 3\%) carbohydrate diet for 55
   days. Wild shrimp showed a direct relation between dietary CHO and
   lactate, protein and hemocyte levels indicating that dietary CHO was
   used for protein synthesis via transamination pathways. In
   seventh-generation cultured shrimp these parameters were inversely
   proportional to dietary CHO level, indicating the capacity to synthesize
   protein from dietary CHO was repressed in cultured shrimp. Farmed shrimp
   showed a limited capacity to respond to LCHO diets demonstrating high
   protein dependence in their metabolism and immune response. These
   results demonstrate that during size-based breeding programs other
   metabolic process than CHO catabolism can be selected. The incapacity of
   shrimp to use dietary CHO could limit protein reduction of diets and
   limit the efforts of the shrimp industry to be ecologically and

Abstract = {The effect of long-range Coulomb interactions on bulk properties is
   studied for the ionic solids NaBr and NaCl. The embedded cluster
   approach in the framework of density functional theory is employed. The
   Madelung potential is calculated with the Evjen cube summation method.
   To explore the effects of the long-range interactions on the electron
   densities and the Madelung constant, the Evjen cube size is varied from
   310 to 19650 point charges for 33 atom clusters. To study the size
   effect of the quantum region, all-electron clusters with 33 to 87 atoms,
   embedded in Evjen cubes of 6859 point charges, are investigated. The
   results show that for the 81 and 87 atom clusters the Madelung potential
   is constant from the center up to the second neighbor shell. For the
   same atoms, in all clusters, the electron density at the nuclei has
   nearly the same value. The largest difference found for the positive
   ions was 0.54\%, and for the negative ions, 0.14\%. (C) 2003 Wiley

Title = {Period and phase control in a multioscillatory circadian system

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-57},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The circadian system of the lizard Iguana iguana is composed of several
   independent pacemakers that work in concert: the pineal gland, retinae
   of the lateral eyes, and a fourth oscillator presumed to be located in
   the hypothalamus. These pacemakers govern the circadian expression of
   multiple behaviors and physiological processes, including rhythms in
   locomotor activity, endogenous body temperature, electroretinogram, and
   melatonin synthesis. The numerous, easily measurable rhythmic outputs
   make the iguana an ideal organism for examining the contributions of
   individual oscillators and their interactions in governing the
   expression of overt circadian rhythms. The authors have examined the
   effects of pinealectomy and enucleation on the endogenous body
   temperature rhythm (BTR) and locomotor activity rhythm (LAR) of juvenile
   iguanas at constant temperature both in LD cycles and in constant
   darkness (DID). They measured the periods (tau) of the circadian rhythms
   of LAR and BTR, the phase relationships between them in DID (Psi(AT)),
   and the phase relationship between each rhythm and the light cycle
   (Psi(RL)). Pinealectomy lengthened tau of locomotor activity in all
   animals tested and abolished the BTR in two-thirds of the animals. In
   those animals in which the BTR did persist following pinealectomy tau
   lengthened to the same extent as that of locomotor activity.
   Pinealectomy also delayed the onset of activity with respect to its
   normal phase relationship with body temperature in DD. Enucleation alone
   had no significant effect on tau of LAR or BTR; however, after
   enucleation, BTR became 180 degrees out of phase from LAR in DID. After
   both pinealectomy and enucleation, 4 of 16 animals became arrhythmic in
   both activity and body temperature. Their data suggest that rhythmicity,
   period, and phase of overt circadian behaviors are regulated through the
   combined output of multiple endogenous circadian oscillators.},

Abstract = {Circadian rhythms of locomotor activity shown by freshwater decapods
   display different patterns among crayfish, Procambarus, and crabs, when
   exposed to artificial light-dark cycles. Crayfish are mainly nocturnal
   while a crepuscular activity is observed in crabs of the genus
   Pseudothelphusa. In constant darkness, free running rhythms are
   displayed in unimodal or bimodal patterns by crayfish Procambarus;
   however, Pseudothelphusa continues to show bimodal rhythms. The many
   studies using locomotor activity indicate that the rhythm in freshwater
   crabs is circadian in nature, but that a multioscillatory system may be
   controlling the overt rhythm. In the present study, the implications of
   different locomotor activity patterns are analyzed in selected
   freshwater decapods with regard to the interactions between light and
   the organisms. Crabs and crayfish are commonly found in similar
   habitats, often sharing the same environment; however, different
   patterns of locomotor activity as well as different sensitivities of the
   bouts of activity with regard to entrainment by light, indicate that
   distinct temporal niches may exist that result in temporal exclusion or
   low competition.},

Abstract = {report shows the calcium ion diffusion process through the different
   parts of maize kernels (pericarp, endosperm, and germ) during the
   traditional nixtamalization process as a function of steeping time (t)
   0-24 hr. The cooking step of the nixtamalization process used 3 kg of
   maize kernels in 6L of water and 2\% calcium hydroxide (w/w). The
   cooking temperature was 92degreesC for 40 min. The calcium content of
   the samples was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. We found
   that the whole instant corn flour, pericarp, endosperm, and germ, had a
   nonlinear relationship to steeping time, showing a local maximum at 9
   hr. Analysis of the different parts of the nixtamalized kernels showed
   that in short steeping times (0-5 hr) calcium diffusion took place
   mainly in the pericarp. Calcium diffusion in the endosperm and germ
   occurred gradually over longer steeping times. However, the physical
   state of the kernels (broken kernels) accelerated the diffusion process.
   Calcium diffusion occurred first in the pericarp, followed by the
   endosperm and germ. Immediately after cooking (t = 0 hr), we found a
   1.148\% calcium content in the pericarp, 0.007\% in the germ, and
   0.028\% in the endosperm. After 24 hr of steeping, the calcium contents
   were 2.714\% in the pericarp, 0.776\% in the germ, and 0.181\% in the
   endosperm. In another study, the calcium content in the endosperm was
   measured by first separating the 10\% from the outermost, followed by
   another 10\% from the next endosperm tissue, and concluding with the
   remaining 80\%. Calcium ions were present mainly in the outermost layers
   of the endosperm. The damaged kernels steeped for more than 5 hr showed
   greater calcium concentrations than the undamaged counterparts.},

Title = {A numerical study of the interaction between two ejecta in the
   interplanetary medium: one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations},
Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3741-3749},
Abstract = {We studied the heliospheric evolution in one and two dimensions of the
   interaction between two ejecta-like disturbances beyond the critical
   point: a faster ejecta 2 overtaking a previously launched slower ejecta
   1. The study is based on a hydrodynamic model using the ZEUS-3-D code.
   This model can be applied to those cases where the interaction occurs
   far away from the Sun and there is no merging (magnetic reconnection)
   between the two ejecta. The simulation shows that when the faster ejecta
   2 overtakes ejecta I there is an interchange of momentum between the two
   ejecta, where the leading ejecta 1 accelerates and the tracking ejecta 2
   decelerates. Both ejecta tend to arrive at 1 AU having similar speeds,
   but with the front of ejecta 1 propagating faster than the front of
   ejecta 2. The momentum is transferred from ejecta 2 to ejecta 1 when the
   shock initially driven by ejecta 2 passes through ejecta 1. Eventually
   the two shock waves driven by the two ejecta merge together into a
   single stronger shock. The 2-D simulation shows that the evolution of
   the interaction can be very complex and there are very different
   signatures of the same event at different viewing angles; however, the
   transferring of momentum between the two ejecta follows the same
   physical mechanism described above. These results are in qualitative
   agreement with in-situ plasma observations of ``multiple magnetic
   clouds{''} detected at 1 AU.},

Abstract = {In recent years, agent-based computational models have been used to
   study financial markets. One of the most interesting elements involved
   in these studies is the process of learning, in which market
   participants try to obtain information from the market in order to
   improve their strategies and hence increase their profits. While in
   other papers it has been shown how this learning process is determined
   by factors such as the adaptation period, the composition of the market
   and the intensity of the signals that an agent can perceive, in this
   paper we shall discuss the effect of external information in the
   learning process in an artificial financial market (AFM). In particular,
   we will analyze the case when external information is such that it
   forces all participants to randomly revise their expectations of the
   future. Even though AMFs usually use sophisticated artificial
   intelligence techniques, in this study we show how interesting results
   can be obtained using a quite elementary genetic algorithm.},

   involved in learning and memory and in the control of complex behavior.
   In most bisects, the mushroom bodies receive direct olfactory input in
   their calyx region. In Hymenoptera, olfactory input is layered in the
   calyx. In ants, several layers can be discriminated that correspond to
   different clusters of glomeruli in the antennal lobes, perhaps
   corresponding to different classes of odors. Only in Hymenoptera, the
   mushroom body calyx also receives direct visual input from the optic
   lobes. In bees, six calycal layers receive input from different classes
   of visual interneurons, probably representing different parts of the
   visual field and different visual properties. Taken together, the
   mushroom bodies receive distinct multisensory information in many
   segregated input layers.},

Abstract = {Most modern lossless data compression techniques used today, are based
   in dictionaries. If some string of data being compressed matches a
   portion previously seen, then such string is included in the dictionary
   and its reference is included every time it appears. A possible
   generalization of this scheme is to consider not only strings made of
   consecutive symbols, but more general patterns with gaps between its
   symbols. The main problems with this approach are the complexity of
   pattern discovery algorithms and the complexity for the selection of a
   good subset of patterns. In this paper we address the last of these
   problems. We demonstrate that such problem is NP-complete and we provide
   some preliminary results about heuristics that points to its solution.},

Abstract = {In this work, theoretical and experimental studies are presented oil the
   natural convection flow in a naturally fractured reservoir, produced by
   a vertical geothermal gradient. The present approach considers finite
   oil-filled, tilted fractures with small aspect ratios, with a fluid
   thermal conductivity assumed to be very small compared with the thermal
   conductivity of the rock matrix. These assumptions are fully justified
   for actual Mexican naturally fractured reservoirs. Finite tilted porous
   layers saturated with oil have also been considered. In all the cases
   studied, convection occurs under any vertical temperature gradient. In
   addition, the diffusion and dispersion of nitrogen (N-2) is studied,
   with this substance located initially at the top of the fracture. In
   these types of flows, the influence of convection over diffiusion and
   dispersion of passive substances is extremely small.},

Title = {Heterogeneity of xerophytic vegetation of limestone outcrops in a
   tropical deciduous forest region in southern Mexico},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {175},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-163},
Abstract = {The heterogeneity of xerophytic vegetation developing on limestone
   outcrops immersed in a tropical deciduous forest matrix was studied in
   Nizanda (S Mexico). The study units comprised three clearly distinct
   communities based on their physiognomy and substrate, representing a
   gradient of edaphic aridity: (1) xerophytic scrub (XS); (2) tropical
   deciduous forest on rock (TDFr); and (3) tropical deciduous forest on
   deeper soil (TDFs). Structural and floristic variables were gathered in
   nine 100 m(2) plots by community. In the 0.27 ha sampled 211 plant
   species were recorded. Total floristic richness by community decreased
   with increasing edaphic aridity: 159 species in TDFs, 107 in TDFr, and
   36 in XS. Although significant differences were observed between the
   three communities for only four structural variables (total and upper
   stratum species densities, and relative monocotyledon density and
   cover), other variables confirmed the differences between the two forest
   communities and the XS (total and upper stratum cover, density, and
   basal area). TDFr and XS also differed from TDFs with respect to lower
   stratum species density, and absolute monocotyledon density and cover.
   The results showed the importance of monocotyledons and the prevalence
   of clonality in TDFr and XS. A comparison between limestone outcrop and
   inselberg vegetation indicated a virtual absence of therophytes,
   graminoid herbs, cryptogamic crusts, and desiccation-tolerant and
   carnivorous plants in the former, whereas the prevalence of
   monocotyledon mats, and xerophytic and succulent plants is the most
   striking similarity between these rocky environments. Xerophytic
   vegetation of limestone outcrops in Nizanda may be seen as analogous of
   relictual communities that existed during a northbound migration of
   Neotropical flora, towards the and zones of North America.},

Title = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - Pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches},
Journal = {DRUGS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-430},
Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), also termed cryptogenic fibrosing
   alveolitis, is a clinicopathological syndrome characterised by cough,
   exertional dyspneoa, basilar crackles, a restrictive defect on pulmonary
   function tests, honeycombing on high-resolution, thin-section computed
   tomographic scans and the histological diagnosis of usual interstitial
   pneumonia on lung biopsy. The course is usually indolent but inexorable.
   Most patients die of progressive respiratory failure within 3-8 years of
   the onset of symptoms. Current therapies are of unproven benefit.
   Although the pathogenesis of IPF has not been elucidated, early concepts
   focused on lung injury leading to a cycle of chronic alveolar
   inflammation eventuating in fibrosis and destruction of the lung
   architecture. Anti-inflammatory therapies employing corticosteroids or
   immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents have been disappointing. More
   recent hypotheses acknowledge that sequential alveolar epithelial cell
   injury is likely to be a key event in the pathogenesis of IPF, but the
   cardinal event is an aberrant host response to wound healing. In this
   context, abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, altered
   fibroblast phenotypes, exaggerated fibroblast proliferation, and
   excessive deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix are pivotal to
   the fibrotic process.
   Several clinical trials are currently underway or in the planning
   stages, and include drugs such as interferon-gamma 1b, pirfenidone,
   acetylcysteine, etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist),
   bosentan (an endothelin-I receptor antagonist) and zileuton (a
   5-lypoxygenase inhibitor). Future therapeutic strategies should be
   focused on alveolar epithelial cells aimed at enhancing
   re-epithelialisation and on fibroblastic/myofibroblastic foci, which
   play an essential role in the development of IPF. Stem cell progenitors
   of the alveolar epithelial cells and genetic and epigenetic therapies
   are attractive future approaches for this and other fibrotic lung
   disorders.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among specimens from 25 different locations
   for the six Mexican coastal leopard frog species of the Rana berlandieri
   species group were investigated using 797 bp of the mitochondrial 12S
   rDNA gene. Relationships among the haplotypes obtained were recovered
   using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Most of the clades
   recovered by both tree building methods are strongly supported, but
   conflicting clades recovered by each analysis are generally poorly
   supported. Both analyses reject the previously proposed subgroupings of
   the R. berlandieri species group. Based on the strongly supported
   relationships, genetic differentiation, and geographic distribution of
   the haplotypes examined, nine independent lineages appear to comprise
   the group of study. However, confirmation of the new proposed lineages
   will require further analyses based on other genetic markers and
   additional samples that cover their entire geographic distribution.
   Concordance was noted between Miocene-Pliocene geological and climatic
   events in Mexico and the relationships recovered among the lineages
   proposed and their geographic distribution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Title = {Theoretical study of intradimer mechanism for diamond growth over
   diamond (100)},
Journal = {STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Pages = {541-550},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The study of the energetics of the accepted intradimer diamond growth
   mechanism over (100) diamond surface is presented. The calculations were
   made in a density functional approach with the DGauss code using a DZVP2
   basis set and a BLYP interchange and correlation potential. A simple
   9-carbon cluster modeling the (100) diamond surface was used; its
   validity is discussed in relation with other calculations that used
   larger model clusters. The mechanism, presented in six steps, is based
   in the Harris and Garrison's work that considers the methyl radical as
   the main growth precursor agent and the breaking of the dimer surface
   bond with the corresponding methylene radical formation as a prior step
   to the formation of a CH2-bridge structure, which is a feasible step; in
   contrast to these molecular dynamics results, Huang and Frenklach, using
   semiempirical methods, consider the breaking of the dimer surface bond
   and the formation of a CH2-bridge structure as one step and this step as
   the energetically determinant of the mechanism. They also found an
   activation energy barrier for the interaction between a radical surface
   center with a H. and CH3.. The present work tries to discern between
   these two ideas by calculating the activation barriers and the reaction
   energies for each step of the Harris and Garrison's mechanism in a
   density functional approach and comparing them to the results of Huang
   and Frenklach. The energy calculations point toward the scission of the
   dimer bond (step 4) as the determinant step; this step is endothermic,
   with an energy barrier of 50.43 kcal-mol(-1). On the other hand, the
   formation of the CH2-bridge structure (step 5) is a feasible step with
   an energy barrier of 13.57 kcal-mol(-1). The adsorption of CH3. (step 2)
   and H. (step 6) species over radical surface sites did not involve any
   energy barriers, as it would be hoped. These steps were strongly
   exothermic and are close to the thermodynamic values for C-C and C-H
   bond energies. The removal of methylic hydrogen (step 3) did not show
   any problem because the activation barrier is only 3.68 kcal-mol(-1)
   less than the removal of a surface hydrogen (step 1), which has an
   energy barrier of 19.59 kcal-mol(-1). All steps, except number 4, were
   exothermic.},

Title = {Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) of Mexican hydrological basins

Abstract = {Aim The distributional patterns of helminthological fauna of freshwater
   fishes were analysed to postulate a general hypothesis on the
   relationships of some Mexican hydrological systems.
   Location Eight hydrological systems of central and eastern Mexico were
   studied and compared with records from Nicaragua.
   Methods A Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) was applied to the
   presence/absence of ninety-two helminth parasite taxa (Monogeneans,
   Digeneans, Cestodes, Acanthocephalans and Nematodes) of freshwater
   fishes, from eight Mexican hydrological systems, using the Hennig86
   program.
   Results The results represent the first attempt for a biogeographical
   analysis through application of the PAE method to the distributional
   patterns of helminth parasites of freshwater fishes in Mexico. A single
   most parsimonious cladogram was obtained, which grouped all the
   Neotropical systems in accordance with previous proposals based on other
   plant and animal taxa.
   Main conclusions The most basal systems were Santiago and Lerma basins,
   which exhibited Nearctic affinities. The remaining areas of the
   cladogram showed Neotropical affinities. All the southeastern systems
   were grouped in a clade with the Nicaragua system, providing support for
   a `Mesoamerican province' based on helminth parasites of cichlids. The
   cladogram also suggests that the treatment of the Lerma-Santiago basin
   as a single biogeographical unit is inaccurate and that they should be
   treated as separate systems.},

Abstract = {Micrurus pachecogili is a rare coralsnake that inhabits the desert
   region around Zapotitlan Salinas in southern Puebla, Mexico. The
   original description of this species was based on 2 specimens. We report
   on morphological variation, sexual dimorphism, and distribution based on
   4 additional specimens. Males have 218-223 ventrals, 43-48 subcaudals,
   and 24-30 black body rings; females have 235-242 ventrals, 37-39
   subcaudals, and 29-30 black body rings. This new material was collected
   at localities within the Zapotitlan Basin. The coralsnake most similar
   to M. pachecogili seems to be M. nebularis, which is restricted to
   pine-oak forest near Ixtlan de Juarez in central Oaxaca. Micrurus
   nebularis is easily distinguished in having fewer ventrals (203-208 in
   males and 218-223 in females).},

Abstract = {Optimal sperm quality is an important feature for management of shrimp
   broodstock. The understanding of the sperm quality in relation to age
   and weight of shrimp is useful to select male broodstock. To evaluate
   the effect of age and weight on sperm quality, Litopenaeus vannamei
   males from the same cohort at ages of 6, 8, 10, and 12 months were
   examined, using body weight as a covariable in ANCOVA. Additionally,
   males of the same cohort at an age of 12 months, but from different
   culture conditions, were compared. Spermatophore weight, sperm count,
   and percentage of normal sperm were positively correlated to body
   weight. Sperm count was positively correlated to spermatophore weight
   and percentage of normal sperm. Males at an age of 12 months had
   superior sperm quality than younger males, based on observations of
   larger spermatophore weight, higher sperm count, and higher percentage
   of normal sperm. By eliminating the influence of body weight with the
   use of ANCOVA, the same effect was still observed, indicating that the
   effect of age of males on sperm quality was independent of body weight.
   However, when large differences in growth were forced by changing
   culture conditions, sperm quality differences were observed and could be
   explained by body weight. In conclusion, using 12-month-old males would
   lead to improved shrimp seed production, since they are mature males
   with high sperm quality. In addition, for improved productivity, it is
   important to consider the culture conditions under which domesticated
   male broodstock will be obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {We describe a new species of lizard of the genus Abronia from the Sierra
   Madre del Stir of Guerrero, Mexico. This species previously was confused
   with its presumed sister taxon Abronia deppii. The discovery to the
   north of the Balsas Basin of additional specimens referrable to A.
   deppii and a morphological comparison of these specimens to the
   populations of Abronia inhabiting the highlands of Guerrero to the south
   of the Balsas Basin clearly indicate that distinct species are present
   on each side of the Balsas Depression. Examination of the type material
   of A. deppii reveals that this name should be associated with the
   northern populations, and the southern population, often allocated to A.
   deppii, is an undescribed species. This new species is distinguished
   from A. deppii by having enlarged knob-like posterior head scales, no
   azygous scale between interparietal and interoccipital, a greater number
   of scale whorls on unregenerated tail, a greater number of infralabial
   scales, and dorsal and ventral coloration differences. We discuss the
   natural history of the new Guerrero species.},

Journal = {CIENCIAS MARINAS},

Abstract = {Preliminary results of the effects of different dietary protein levels
   and commercial feeds on growth and feeding of juvenile common snook,
   Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch, 1792), were obtained under controlled
   laboratory conditions in two experiments. In the first experiment (60
   days), juveniles (initially 2.9 g) maintained at 26.6degreesC were fed
   one of four isocaloric experimental diets containing different protein
   levels (diet A = 28.8\%, diet B = 40.4\%, diet C = 53.4\%, and diet D =
   65.8\%). Shrimp-, soybean-, and fish-meal were used as protein sources.
   Best growth, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio were
   obtained with diets B, C, and D. There Were no significant differences
   (P > 0.05) among these three treatments. Protein efficiency ratio
   decreased as the level of dietary protein increased and was highest for
   fish fed diet A. In the second experiment (65 days), the effects of
   three different commercial pellets (for tilapia, catfish, and trout) and
   diet C were determined on snook (initially 22.7 g) at 29.1degreesC.
   There was no significant difference in fish weight gain between diet C
   and trout pellets. Significantly higher (P < 0.05) weight gain was
   achieved with diet C and trout pellets compared with that of fish fed
   the tilapia and catfish pellets. Specific growth rate and feed
   conversion ratio were best with diet C, and significant differences
   among all treatments were obtained. Protein efficiency ratio for fish
   fed diet C and trout and tilapia feeds was not significantly different.
   The results confirm the snook's ability to feed on pellets, its
   capability to adapt to dry feeds, the potential of commercial feeds for
   raising snook, and its relatively high dietary protein requirement.},

Abstract = {Long-term recordings of locomotor activity were obtained from intact
   freshwater crabs, Pseudothelphusa americana in constant darkness (DD),
   constant light (LL) and different light-dark (LD) protocols. Bimodal
   rhythms were typically observed in this crab when subjected to DD or LD,
   with bouts of activity anticipating lights-on and lights-off,
   respectively. Freerunning circadian rhythms were expressed in both DD
   and LL for longer than 30 days. In DD, we observed that some animals
   presented different period lengths for each activity component. During
   LL, activity was primarily unimodal, however spontaneous splitting of
   the rhythms were observed in some animals. When activity was recorded
   under artificial long days, the morning bouts maintained their phase
   relationship but the evening bouts changed their phase relationship with
   the Zeitgeber. Our results indicate that, bimodal locomotor activity
   rhythm in the crab Pseudothelphusa americana is variable among
   organisms. The characteristics of phase relationship with LD and
   responses to LL for morning and evening bouts, suggest that, locomotor
   activity could be driven by multiple oscillators, and that coupling
   between these oscillators may be regulated by light.},

Abstract = {We collected 423 species of diurnal butterflies (Rhopalocera) during 250
   clays of observations from March 1997 through January 2000 in the region
   of Calakmul, Campeche, Mexico. We present a list of 428 species recorded
   for Calakmul. This is the first reported list of butterflies for the
   state of Campeche, and it includes 290 new records for the state, 374
   new records for Calakmul, and 1 new record for Mexico: Monca telata.
   Museum records were found for 5 additional species: Caria melino, Cissia
   labe, Tmolus echion, Emesis lupina lupina, and Calephelis azteca. The
   accumulation curve of species estimates that 457 species should be
   present in Calakmul, which suggests the list presented is 93\% complete.
   We found that medium, tropical, semi-evergreen forest is the richest
   (371 species); more than a quarter of the butterflies of the Calakmul
   region were found exclusively in this forest. We also found the southern
   area slightly more abundant in species (82\%) than the northern area
   (79\%). Additionally, a comparison was made of the list generated for
   Campeche to lists from previous studies for Quintana Roo,
   Tikal-Guaternala National Park, and Belize. The comparison shows that
   70\%, 58\%, and 54\% of the butterfly species in Calakmul also are found
   in Tikal, Quintana Roo, and Belize, respectively.},

Abstract = {A review of the shape phase transitions within the IBA, is presented.
   This nuclear model depends on two control parameters, (r(2), r(1)), and
   two order parameters, (beta, gamma). In the control parameter space, the
   accesible shapes and stability properties of the Consistent-Q nuclear
   model are established. The procedure of coherent states plus catastrophe
   formalisms to determine the shape phase diagram of an algebraic nuclear
   model is illustrated by considering the Meshkov-Glick-Lipkin nuclear
   model. The relevance of the separatrix to organize the classical orbits
   and the structure of the quantum energy levels is established.},

Abstract = {The Mexican free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana, is one of
   the most widely distributed bats, and its range includes the whole
   Mexican territory. Ectoparasites of this bat have been the subject of
   isolated reports, but no studies of its community ecology have been
   conducted. The acarine infracommunities associated with this bat were
   analyzed, comparing bat populations from three and regions of Mexico: an
   abandoned factory in Nombre de Dios, Durango; a cave in Santiago, Nuevo
   Leon; and a church in Concepcion del Oro, Zacatecas. The acarine
   infracommunity in Nuevo Leon's bats exhibited the highest levels of
   diversity as reflected by a higher richness, a lower dominance, and a
   moderate and relatively homogeneous abundance in this locality in
   relation to the other two. This pattern is influenced by stable cave
   conditions relative to artificial habitats. Not withstanding, further
   studies are required to determine whether or not different habitat
   conditions are a primary factor in the process of structuring the acari
   infracommunities.},

Abstract = {The brown alga Ralfsia expansa described by Borgesen (1912) and Tanaka
   \& Chihara (1980a) may actually be two different species. To evaluate
   this possibility, a comparison of R. expansa with the related species R.
   hancockii was made. The following specimens were examined: the holotype
   of R. hancockii and several other specimens of this species from 11
   localities along the Mexican tropical Pacific coast, and three specimens
   of R. expansa from the type locality (Veracruz, Mexico). The
   observations confirm the diagnostic value of: (1) the number of cells
   per stalk of the unilocular reproductive structures; and (2) the
   presence of a cortical layer of several cells differentiated from the
   medulla; they also confirm the lack of diagnostic value of certain other
   features such as the symmetry of the thallus in longitudinal radial
   section. We consider R. expansa sensu Borgesen to be a distinct species,
   typically found on the tropical Atlantic coast. Specimens of R. expansa
   sensu Tanaka \& Chihara, described in previous reports from the Pacific
   coast of Mexico, are actually R. hancockii, which appears to be
   restricted to the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico.},

Abstract = {In this work, the conjugated heat transfer characteristics of a thin
   vertical strip of finite length, placed in a porous medium has been
   studied using numerical and asymptotic techniques. The nondimensional
   temperature distribution in the strip and the reduced Nusselt number at
   the top of the strip are obtained as a function of the thermal
   penetration parameter s, which measures the thermal region where the
   temperature of the strip decays to the ambient temperature of the
   surrounding fluid. The numerical values of this nondimensional parameter
   permits to classify the different physical regimes, showing different
   solutions: a thermally long behaviour, an intermediate transition and a
   short strip limit. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier

Abstract = {(1) Final temperature preferendum of juvenile (0.9-1.9 g) and adult
   (5.2-12.5 g) angelfish Pterophyllum scalare were determined with acute
   and gravitation methods. The final preferenda were similar, independent
   of the method and development stage (29.0-31.1degreesC).
   (2) The critical thermal maxima (CTMax) for juveniles were 36.9degreesC,
   37.6degreesC, 40.6degreesC, 40.8degreesC and for adults 38.4degreesC,
   38.6degreesC. 41.0degreesC. 42.1degreesC. Adult angelfish CTMax was
   slightly higher than in juveniles (1degreesC; P<0.05); the endpoint of
   CTMax was the onset of spasms.
   (3) The acclimation response ratio for both stages had an interval of
   0.33-0.44; these values are in agreement with results for subtropical
   and tropical fishes.
   (4) Therefore it is recommended that angelfish cultivation should be
   consistent with temperatures that do not change abruptly throughout the
   year and temperature maximum does not exceed 30degreesC.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the sequential expression of several matrix
   metalloproteinases ( MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
   (TIMPs), and growth factors as well as the presence of apoptosis in a
   model of pulmonary fibrosis induced in rats with paraquat and hyperoxia.
   Animals showing neither clinical nor morphological changes with this
   double aggression were classified as ``resistant{''}. Rats were killed
   at 1, 2, 3, and 6 wk, and lungs were used for collagen content, gene
   expression by real-time PCR, gelatinolytic activity by zymography,
   apoptosis by in situ DNA fragmentation, and protein localization by
   immunohistochemistry. Our results showed a significant decrease of
   collagenases MMP-8 and MMP-13, with an increase of TIMP-1 and
   transforming growth factor-beta. Immunoreactive TIMP-1 was increased in
   experimental rats and primarily localized in alveolar macrophages.
   Expression of gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNAs was not affected, but
   lung zymography revealed an increase in progelatinase B, progelatinase
   A, and its active form. Epithelial apoptosis was evident from the first
   week, whereas at later periods, interstitial cell apoptosis was also
   noticed. Resistant animals behave as controls. These findings suggest
   that an imbalance between collagenases and TIMPs, excessive
   gelatinolytic activity, and epithelial apoptosis participate in the
   fibrotic response in this experimental model.},

Abstract = {Derangement in pulmonary surfactant or its components and alveolar
   collapse are common findings in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
   Surfactant proteins play important roles in innate host defense and
   normal function of the lung. We examined associations between IPF and
   genetic polymorphic variants of surfactant proteins, SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B,
   SP-C, and SP-D. One SP-A1 (6A(4)) allele and single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) that characterize the 6A(4) allele, and one SP-B
   (B1580\_C) were found with higher frequency (Pless than or equal to0.01)
   in nonsmoker and smoker IPF (n=84) subgroups, respectively, compared
   with healthy controls (n=194). To explore whether a tryptophan (present
   in 6A(4)) or an arginine (present in other SP-A1 alleles and in all
   SP-A2 alleles) at amino acid 219 alters protein behavior, two truncated
   proteins that varied only at amino acid 219 were oxidized by exposure to
   ozone. Differences in the absorption spectra (310-350 nm) between the
   two truncated recombinant SP-A proteins were observed both before and
   after protein oxidation, suggesting allele-specific aggregation
   differences attributable to amino acid 219. The SP-B SNP B1580\_C (odds
   ratio:7.63; confidence interval:1.64-35.4; Pless than or equal to0.01),
   to be a risk factor for IPF smokers, has also been shown to be a risk
   factor for other pulmonary diseases. The SP-C and SP-D SNPs and
   SP-B-linked microsatellite markers studied did not associate with IPF.
   These findings indicate that surfactant protein variants may serve as
   markers to identify subgroups of patients at risk, and we speculate that
   these contribute to IPF pathogenesis.},

Abstract = {Genetic differentiation and variability data of two populations of two
   species of shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus (L.) and L. schmitti
   (Burkenroad)) have been obtained by electrophoretic analysis and by
   analysis of 16S mitochondrial DNA. Using eight polymorphic enzymes, the
   genetic distance (GD) between the two species was 0.165. The GD between
   L. setiferus populations was 0.0057 and between L. schmitti populations
   it was 0.0034. The greatest differentiation was found within, rather
   than between, populations, although the differentiation value between
   Mexican and Cuban populations varied in accordance with the geographic
   distance and ecological characteristic of each. We found a high
   similarity between these two species with a bimodal distribution of the
   loci with respect to genetic identity. The homology percentages for gene
   16S fragments were compared with those from six different shrimp species
   (L. vannamei, L. stylirostris, Farfantepenaeus notialis, Metapeneopsis
   lamellata) and Artemia salina. Ninety-seven percent of identity was
   found by analysis of a 409 bp of 16S mitochondrial DNA. With these
   values a phylogenetic tree was made using parsimony criteria. The GDs
   obtained with this method confirm the classification proposed by
   Perez-Farfante \& Kensley (1997).},

Abstract = {Progesterone and estradiol participate in the regulation of several
   reproductive functions through interaction with intracellular
   progesterone receptors (PR) and estrogen receptors (ER), respectively.
   In this work, we determined PR and ER-alpha isoforms content in the
   brain of chicks of both sexes on days 8 and 13 of embryonic development
   as well as on the day of hatching by Western blot analysis. PR isoforms
   protein content increased during embryonic development in both female
   and male chick brain. The highest PR isoforms content was observed on
   the day of hatching in both sexes. Interestingly, PR-A content was
   higher in the brain of chick males than in that of females on day 8 of
   embryonic development. PR-A/PR-B ratio was higher in the brain of males
   than in that of females at all ages. We found two ER-alpha isoforms of
   66 and 52 kDa; the content of both isoforms was higher in the brain of
   females than in that of males on days 8 and 13 of embryonic development.
   An opposite pattern of ER-alpha isoforms content was observed. In males,
   ER-alpha content increased during embryonic development whereas in the
   females it decreased during this process. These results indicate that
   the content of PR and ER-alpha isoforms is related to the degree of
   brain development in chicks, and suggest that PR and ER-alpha isoforms
   should exhibit sexual dimorphism in the brain of chicks during embryonic
   development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The role of tobacco smoking in the development and outcome of pulmonary
   fibrosis is uncertain. To approach the effects of cigarette smoke on
   bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, we studied five groups of guinea pigs:
   1) controls, 2) instilled with bleomycin (B), 3) exposed to tobacco
   smoke for 6 wk (TS), 4) bleomycin instillation plus tobacco smoke
   exposure for 6 wk (B + TS), and 5) tobacco smoke exposure for 6 wk and
   bleomycin after smoking (TS/B). Guinea pigs receiving bleomycin and
   tobacco smoke exposure exhibited higher fibrotic lesions including a
   significant increase in the number of positive alpha-smooth muscle actin
   cells compared with bleomycin alone (B + TS, 3.4 +/- 1.2\%; TS/ B, 3.7
   +/- 1.5\%; B, 2.3 +/- 1.5\%; P < 0.01). However, only the TS/ B group
   reached a significant increase in lung collagen compared with the
   bleomycin group (TS/B, 3.5 +/- 0.7; B +/- TS, 2.9 +/- 0.4; B, 2.4 +/-
   0.2 mg hydroxyproline/lung; P < 0.01). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from
   TS/ B showed an increased number of eosinophils and higher levels of
   IL-4 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (P < 0.01 for all
   comparisons) and induced a significant increase in fibroblast
   proliferation (P < 0.05). Importantly, smoke exposure alone induced an
   increase in BAL neutrophils, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and fibroblast
   proliferation compared with controls, suggesting that tobacco smoke
   creates a profibrotic milieu that may contribute to the increased
   bleomycin-induced fibrosis.},

Abstract = {The Toeplitz-Hausdorff Theorem asserts that for any operator A acting on
   a complex Hilbert space H, the set of numbers of the form <Az, z>, where
   z varies over the unit sphere of H, is always a convex subset of C. In
   this paper we obtain the same result for non-homogeneous quadratic
   functions of the form <Az, z> + <a, z> + <z, beta> + c. This implies, in
   particular, that the set of numbers of the form <Az, z>, where z varies
   over any sphere in H, centered or not at the origin, is always convex.
   We also show by an example that the corresponding result is not true for
   pairs of operators on a real Hilbert space.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests are dynamic systems with extensive natural disturbance,
   gaps in the canopy being one of the most important types. Tree and
   branch fall are often the principal cause of natural disturbance. This
   research was done on adult individuals of a very abundant palm
   (Astrocaryum mexicanum Liebm, Arecaceae), which is found in the
   understorey of the forest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Percentages of
   colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizae were determined for individuals
   selected randomly from plots located both in gaps and under closed
   canopy. The highest percentages of total colonization, as well as those
   of hyphae and vesicles, were recorded for gaps. In forest with closed
   canopy, arbuscules had the highest percentages of colonization; on these
   sites the palm has been observed to grow less. The higher production of
   arbuscules may favour nutrient capture in this microenvironment, which
   is characterized by strong competition.},

Abstract = {We present results of water maser observations in a sample of young
   stellar objects. The observations were made using the Haystack 37 m
   antenna during a span of time of about eight months. The sample was
   selected to study the variability of the water maser emission in young
   sources with far-infrared luminosities between 260 and 2.5 x 10(4)
   L(circle dot). The results are shown in a series of plots that allow the
   analysis of the variation of the maser emission and to discuss the
   global properties of the sample. The results show that in all the
   observed sources the water maser emission varies with time. Based on the
   observed variability, the sample shows two kinds of behavior. About half
   of the sources show large variations in the peak flux density of at
   least one feature (by more than an order of magnitude) in time spans
   between one and several months, while in all the sources there is more
   than one feature where the changes in peak flux density are smaller (by
   less than a factor of 10) but in similar time scales. Finally, the
   variability of the observed water maser emission does not show a clear
   periodicity pattern in time and we do not find a clear relationship
   between the luminosity of the sources and the water maser variability.
   From a statistical point of view, the H(2)O maser variability can be
   described as due to small (10\%) Gaussian fluctuations in the line
   opacity.},

Abstract = {The nuclei of guinea pig spermatogonia and spermatocytes were studied by
   means of quantitative autoradiography and electron microscopic methods
   such as high-resolution cytochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and in situ
   hybridization. Our observations reveal, in the nucleus of spermatogonia
   type B, small lampbrush structures of extended chromatin not found in
   nonmeiotic cells. During meiotic interphase, pairs of parallel lampbrush
   structures become associated by numerous filaments. The formation of the
   synaptonemal complex is simultaneous with the extension of chromosomal
   axes in a continuous leptotene-zygotene stage. Some chromosomes do not
   recognize their homologs before the onset of the leptotene-zygotene
   stage and undergo classical leptotene and zygotene stages. The
   immunocytochemical localization of Dmc1 and Rad51 supports the idea that
   these proteins are not involved in homology search and final pairing.
   Immunolocalization of DNA, RNA polymerase 11, heterogeneous nuclear
   ribonucleoproteins, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and the
   trimethyl-guanosin cap of small nuclear RNAs suggests that the chromatin
   of lampbrush structures transcribe hnRNA and that splicing is scarce.
   The results of quantitative autoradiography after {[}H-3]uridine
   labeling show an intense transcription accompanied by a very slow export
   of RNA. In situ hybridization demonstrates the presence of RNA in the
   regions of homology recognition and pairing. These results lead us to
   propose that the RNA synthesized in the lampbrush structures is involved
   in the process of homology searching and recognition.},

Abstract = {BIOGEOGRAPHY OF NEOTROPICAL PORCUPINES (RODENTIA, HYSTRICOGNATHI):
   INTEGRATING RECENT AND FOSSIL DATA THROUGH A PANBIOGEOGRAPHIC APPROACH.
   This paper analyzes the geographic and temporal distribution of the
   family Erethizontidae (Rodentia, Hystricognathi) and other fossil and
   living groups of neotropical mammals, with the aim of identifying
   distributional patterns. These patterns were recognized using the
   panbiogeographic method, on the basis of three requirements: (1) current
   representation of the groups in the Brazilian Subregion, (2) arboreal
   habits, and (3) recognized monophyly from the Deseadense. Two ancestral
   biotas were identified: one comprising the current Patagonia and areas
   of intertropical latitude mainly in western South America, the other,
   essentially intertropical, includes the fossil localities of the caves
   of Lagoa Santa and Bahia. Both biotas would have differentiated very
   early, at least from late Oligocene. The fossil locality of La Venta
   (middle Miocene) would correspond to a complex area or node. Current
   Patagonia would have acted as an area of marginal differentiation with
   regard to the radiations of the living taxa. The central region of
   Patagonia experienced marine transgressions and volcanic activity during
   the middle Tertiary and could represent a baseline. Both the
   phylogenetic relationships and the temporal and geographic distribution
   of late Miocene erethizontids indicate a geographic differentiation
   between the Northwest and the Northeast Argentina, at least from late
   Miocene.},

   The leaves of F. yoponensis had a significantly higher decomposition

Abstract = {Fire is extensively used in agricultural management in Mexico. There is
   little information on the effects of those practices on the abundance
   and diversity of animals that live within these forest soils. We studied
   the effect of slashing, burning and land use in a tropical deciduous
   forest on ant communities in the State of Jalisco, Mexico. The original
   vegetation (tropical deciduous forest) was modified into a corn field.
   Sampling was carried out in five stages: before slashing, after
   slashing, after burning, after seeding and after harvest. We found that
   very severe fires greatly reduced ant diversity. The most important
   effect of fire was the reduction of ant density, and the change of
   species composition and trophic guilds. These changes are relevant in
   the recycling process of energy in the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {There are two types of pitahaya that are cultivated in Yucatan Peninsula
   of Mexico. They differ mainly in the skin color of the fruit, one of
   them has a red skin (Uqroo1), while the other has a light yellow skin
   (Uqroo2) both belong to Hylocereus undatus (Haworth) Britt. \& Rose. The
   yellow skin pitahaya is the sweetest. The studies were conducted using
   the methods of self pollination and cross pollination, with direct
   crosses and reciprocal pollination in order to evaluate the effect
   related to the quantity of fruits that accomplish their growing process.
   Some characteristic parameters of fruits, thus obtained, were used to
   detect the possible xenic effect. The control samples were collected
   from naturally pollinated flowers. The experimental design used was
   completely random and the experiment was repeated fifteen times. The
   results revealed that the Uqroo1 turned out to be self-compatible, and
   their fruits reached one hundred percent of development. On the other
   hand, Uqroo2 was self-incompatible, that is, it did not accept self
   pollen. The control samples of both types reached the same weight, and
   the fruits of the Uqroo2 produced by cross pollination had the same or
   more weight than the control samples. Several parameters were positively
   correlated. The coefficient between the number of seeds and the fruit
   weight was r=0.84. The highest correlation that was found (r=0.97) in
   the fruit weight and the pulp weight within both types. The, fruits
   obtained by cross-pollination maintained the characteristic of the
   female progenitor. It is suggest intercalate the yellow pitahaya plants
   with another types or species of pitahaya, other than the Uqroo1.},

Abstract = {Time-course experiments were performed on juvenile green abalone
   (Haliotis fulgens) to assess the degree of stress caused by the
   anesthetics magnesium sulfate (MS), benzocaine (BZ), and phenoxyethanol
   (PE). Metabolic rate (VO2) of abalone was reduced by 65, 35, and 18\%
   during short-term (10 or 20 min) exposure to MS, BZ, and PE,
   respectively. Abalones significantly increased their VO2 above control
   values (1.5-fold) after removal of PE from metabolic chambers, whereas
   those treated with MS or BZ recovered their VO2 to preanesthesia values.
   Visual criteria of recovery generally coincided with those of metabolic
   measurements (i.e., 80\% of abalone regained ``normal{''} activity after
   35 min postanesthesia), yet metabolic measurements showed that
   ``fast{''} recovering abalone treated with PE maintained high VO2 values
   during 3-h postanesthesia. Abalone treated and nontreated with
   anesthetics exhibited a circadian metabolic rhythm, with 20-35\% higher
   rates observed during dark than light hours. Despite the short-term
   metabolic alterations with MS, BZ, and PE, the present study suggests
   that all three anesthetics may be safely used in abalone. However,
   detailed evaluations are still needed to assess the effect of anesthesia
   on other physiological variables. The results obtained in this study
   highlight the importance of physiological evaluations when different
   chemical substances are used in aquatic invertebrates.},

   Aspidoscelis rodecki originated from single, or multiple,
   parthenogenetically capable hybrids. We transplanted 292 skin grafts
   within and between the two most geographically distant populations,
   considering only grafts in animals surviving more than 45 days. Two
   hundred fifteen grafts were analyzed. Histocompatibility within (100\%)
   and between (97.9\%) populations suggests that A. rodecki was derived
   from a single, parthenogenetically capable, hybrid.},

Abstract = {Size-selective predation by small (30-50 mm carapace width) and large
   (90-110 mm) Callinectes sapidus when feeding on three different size
   classes of Litopenaeus setiferus was investigated. Laboratory
   experiments using no-choice and multiple-choice designs were carried
   out. Active and passive components of predation were evaluated by
   comparing the probability of attacking (active) and capturing (passive)
   shrimp. Small C. sapidus consumed shrimp of all size classes in similar
   frequencies during multiple and no-choice experiments, and the
   probability of attacking and capturing shrimp of all size classes was
   similar. Large crabs consumed large shrimp with a significantly higher
   frequency during multiple than during no-choice experiments, and the
   probability of capturing large shrimp was significantly higher than
   medium and small ones. Results in the present study suggest that
   size-specific consumption rates of C. sapidus are mainly the result of a
   passive mechanism associated with the salience of shrimp to predation.
   However, an active component of foraging behaviour related to the
   decision to attack an alternative prey whilst consuming one that has
   already been captured, helps to explain the differences in shrimp
   consumption between multiple and no-choice experiments. The complex
   interaction between active, passive components and satiation is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The white mullet Mugil curema is distributed along the Gulf of Mexico
   and Pacific coasts and constitutes an important food resource in Mexico.
   However, during recent years the capture of this mugilid has decreased
   considerably, especially in Bahia and Ensenada de La Paz, Baja
   California Sur, Mexico. The effects of different levels of temperature
   (22, 26, and 30degreesC) and salinity (15, 25, and 35) on the
   instantaneous growth rate, energy content, and condition factor of early
   juveniles of Mugil curema were evaluated. Fish showed a lower growth
   rate, lower body energy content, and a less condition factor when
   exposed to high salinity and temperature. On the basis to the results
   obtained and considering the unusual extreme temperatures and salinity
   registered in Ensenada de La Paz, it is expected low functional
   performance of juvenile mullets beyond the overfishing might contribute
   to the population decrease of this resource.},

Abstract = {The role of GAs in promoting seed germination is well known and
   experiments with seeds from different species have suggested the
   requirement of de novo synthesis of GAs upon imbibition for germination.
   There are also strong indications that the enhancement of GA synthesis
   is part of the mechanism through which environmental signals (i.e.
   light) induce germination. Since along the GA biosynthetic pathway,
   oxidation at C-20 carried out by GA 20-oxidases is thought to be a site
   of regulation, a cDNA clone encoding a GA 20-oxidase was isolated from
   embryos of sorghum (SbGA 20ox). Expression analysis of this gene in
   embryos within imbibed caryopses with low dormancy showed detectable
   amounts of the specific mRNA early upon incubation, increasing
   thereafter. In contrast, it remained barely detectable in embryos from
   dormant caryopses. Changes in endogenous GA(4) levels were in agreement
   with those of SbGA 20ox mRNA, suggesting that GA production might be
   regulated differentially at the level of transcription of this gene. The
   expression of SbGA 20ox was enhanced in incubated embryos isolated from
   either type of caryopses, illustrating a physiological control exerted
   by the surrounding seed tissues on gene expression. The results also
   show that ABA leads to a suppression of transcription of this gene.},

Abstract = {The Chimalapas region, in eastern Oaxaca, Mexico, holds lowland
   rainforests, tropical dry forests, and cloud forests typical of the
   Neotropics, as well as montane pine and pine-oak forests more typical of
   the Nearctic. Totaling more than 600,000 ha, much of the region is
   forested, and in a good state of preservation. The Chimalapas avifauna
   is by far the most diverse for any region of comparable size in the
   country, totalling at least 464 species in the region as a whole (with
   more than 300 species in the lowland rainforest) representing 44\% of
   the bird species known from Mexico. Within the region, the humid
   Atlantic lowlands hold 317 species, the montane regions 113 species, and
   the southern dry forested lowlands 216 species. Important species
   present in the region include Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja and several
   other large eagles, Black Penelopina nigra and probably Horned
   Oreophasis derbianus Guans, Scarlet Macaw Ara macao, Cinnamon-tailed
   Sparrow Aimophila sumichrasti, Rose-bellied Bunting Passerina rositae,
   and Resplendent Quetzal Pharomachrus mocinno. The area holds immense
   lowland rainforests and cloud forests that rank among the largest and
   best preserved in all of Mesoamerica, including a complete
   lowland-to-highland continuum, with entire watersheds preserved more or

Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {35},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The ecological dose (ED50) of Cd on alkaline and acid phosphatase
   activity and the ATP content of three contrasting forest soils was
   measured with or without Cu and Zn to assess the additive toxic effects
   of these two metals. Soils polluted with Cu and/or Zn were treated with
   increasing Cd concentrations to give the following metal combinations:
   Cd, Cd + Cu, Cd + Zn and Cd + Cu + Zn. Alkaline and acid phosphatase
   activities and ATP content of the three soils were analysed 4 h, 7 and
   28 days after the metal additions. The ED50 values were obtained by
   interpolating the enzyme activities or ATP data with a kinetic model and
   the goodness of fit was satisfactory.
   Generally, the ED50 values of both acid and alkaline phosphatase
   activities for Cd were lower (higher toxicity) with than without Cu and
   Zn and the effect of Cu and Zn was particularly adverse when these two
   metals were both added to soils. The alkaline phosphatase was more
   sensitive in the acid and neutral soil whereas the acid phosphatase was
   more sensitive in the alkaline soil. Both phosphatase activities and the
   ATP content were more sensitive in the sandy than in the finer textured
   soils. The ATP content was less sensitive to the additive effects.
   Increasing toxicity was observed during the incubation.
   Analysis of 1 M NH4NO3-extractable Cd, Cu and Zn revealed that Cd
   competed with Zn for the adsorption sites but not with Cu. However, the
   lower ED50 values for Cd of the two phosphatase activities and of the
   ATP content in the presence of heavy metal combinations could be not
   explained by the heavy metal solubility data. It is concluded that the
   ED50 may be a sensitive tool for assessing additve toxic effects to soil
   biochemical parameters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection via female mate choice can result in the evolution of
   elaborate male traits that incur substantial costs for males. Despite
   increased interest in how female mating preferences contribute to the
   evolution of male traits, few studies have directly quantified the
   locomotor costs of such traits. A sexually selected trait that could
   affect movement costs is the sword exhibited by male swordtail fishes:
   while longer swords may increase male mating success, they could
   negatively affect the hydrodynamic aspects of swimming activities. Here,
   we examine the energetic costs of the sword in Xiphophorus montezumae by
   experimentally manipulating sword length and measuring male aerobic
   metabolism during two types of activity, routine swimming and courtship
   swimming. Direct measurements of oxygen consumption indicate that males
   with longer swords expend more energy than males with shortened swords
   during both types of swimming. In addition, the sword increases the cost
   of male courtship. Thus, while sexual selection via female choice
   favours long swords, males with longer swords experience higher
   metabolic costs during swimming, suggesting that sexual and natural
   selection have opposing effects on sword evolution. This study
   demonstrates a hydrodynamic cost of a sexually selected trait. In
   addition, this study discriminates between the cost of a sexually
   selected trait used in courtship and other courtship costs.},

Abstract = {The effects of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing
   hormone (LH) on progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms presence in
   different cell populations from the oviduct magnum of newly-hatched
   chicks treated in vivo on days 13, 15 and 17 of embryonic development,
   were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We found that FSH promoted
   cytodifferentiation of the magnum's mucosa and increased PR
   immunoreactivity in all cell types of the oviduct magnum, whereas
   LH-treatment did not exert cytodifferentiation of magnum's mucosa, and
   PR immunoreactivity was only induced in some epithelial and stromal
   cells of the oviduct magnum. In all treatments the number of PR
   immunopositive cells incubated with the antibody PgR Ab-8 that
   recognizes both PR isoforms were significantly higher than the number of
   immunopositive cells incubated with antibody PgR Ab-6 that only
   recognizes PR-B. This suggests that PR-A should be the predominant
   isoform in the oviduct magnum of newly-hatched chicks treated with
   gonadotropins during embryonic development.
   We conclude that gonadotropins differentially regulate PR-A isoform
   presence in the oviduct magnum of newly-hatched chicks. (C) 2003

Abstract = {New World orioles (Icterus) include several closely related species and
   subspecies pairs that provide excellent opportunities for studying
   recent speciation. We examined a subspecies pair in the Orchard Oriole
   group: Orchard Oriole (l. spurius spurius), a long-distance migrant that
   breeds in eastern North America, and Fuertes's Oriole (l. s. fuertesi),
   a short-distance migrant that breeds in a restricted range in Veracruz,
   Mexico. We sequenced parts of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene (925
   base pairs) and control region (344 base pairs) from 23 Orchard Orioles
   and 7 Fuertes's Orioles. Subspecies are not reciprocally monophyletic.
   Instead, our data suggest that at least one taxon is paraphyletic or
   polyphyletic. We found little support for any further phylogenetic
   structure, including whether one subspecies might be derived from the
   other. However, haplotype frequency analysis suggests that there is
   little or no current gene flow between the taxa. The phylogenetic
   relationship between Orchard and Fuertes's orioles is likely a result of
   recent divergence and incomplete lineage sorting. That interpretation is
   consistent with theoretical models of speciation, which predict patterns
   of nonmonophyly at early stages of taxon divergence. Our findings
   suggest that Orchard and Fuertes's orioles are separate species and
   provide a case study for evaluating the importance of monophyly in
   defining species limits.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider a system whose state x changes to sigma(x) if
   a perturbation occurs at the time t, for t > 0, t is not an element of
   N. Moreover, the state x changes to the new state eta(x) at time t, for
   t is an element of N. It is assumed that the number of perturbations in
   an interval (0, t) is a Poisson process. Here eta and sigma are
   measurable maps from a measure space (E, A, mu) into itself. We give
   conditions for the existence of a stationary distribution of the system
   when the maps eta and sigma commute, and we prove that any stationary
   distribution is an invariant measure of these maps.},

   modifications it underwent upon incorporating new perspectives and
   advances in the study of the biological diversity. The analysis of the
   significant plurality of biodiversity through the comparison of
   definitions and meanings allows to infer the meanings arising from the
   different contexts in which it originated, and also allows to clarify a
   useful and appropriate reference frame to the objectives of conservation

Abstract = {The karyotypes of four gerreids of the western Atlantic Ocean are
   documented. A diploid chromosome complement of 48 telocentric
   chromosomes was found in the four species (2N = 48t, fundamental number
   FN = 48). No differences were detected either in the number of
   chromosomes of the standard karyotype, in their karyotype size, or
   between the karyotypes derived from male or female specimens of any of
   the species. Chromosome length decreased progressively and slightly from
   pair 1 to pair 24. The Ag - NOR karyotypes of E. argenteus and E.
   harengulus were characterized by the position of the nucleolar organizer
   regions next to the centromere in chromosome pair 1, whereas in E. gula
   and E. plumieri Ag - NORs were detected in pair 4. The other 46
   chromosomes showed a light staining of the centromere with no terminal
   or intermediate heterochromatic blocks. All Eucinostomus species showed
   Ag - NORs of similar size, while Eugerres plumieri showed Ag - NORs 10 -
   20\% larger than Eucinostomus species. A combination of size and
   position of the Ag - NORs identified E. gula, while size alone
   identified E. plumieri. However, the ancestral state for size and
   position of Ag - NORs could not be established. There was no
   differential staining of the chromosomes by G-banding. The karyotype of
   the gerreids appears similar to the hypothetical ancestral karyotype of
   fish. The phylogenetic relationships among these species could not be
   established because of the lack of chromosome G-bands. Most likely this
   indicates a homogeneous distribution of GC nucleotides in the
   chromosomes.},

Title = {Physiological, nutritional, and immunological role of dietary β 1-3
   glucan and ascorbic acid 2-monophosphate in Litopenaeus vannamei
   juveniles},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},

Abstract = {The present study was designed to determine the effect of dietary beta
   1-3 glucan (BG) and a megadose of vitamin C on the nutrition (growth and
   survival, blood glucose, lactate, acylglycerides, cholesterol,
   hemocyanin {[}He], digestive gland glycogen {[}DGG]) and the
   immunological system (blood cells, prophenoloxidase {[}ProPO]) in
   Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles. Each treatment was replicated five
   times. Nutritional condition and immunological response of shrimp were
   recorded after 40 days of feeding with specific diets and during 48 h
   after a salinity shock (35-0parts per thousand). A significantly greater
   growth rate was observed in shrimp fed with BG or vitamin. C diets than
   in the control group. Higher blood protein, total blood cells, granular
   cells, and ProPO activity were recorded in shrimp fed with vitamin C as
   compared to the remaining treatments. That means that BG was degraded in
   the digestive gland by beta-glucanases to produce energy, permitting the
   use of more proteins for growth, whereas vitamin C was used to improve
   animal health, enhancing general metabolism in shrimp. The salinity
   stress induced a rapid use of reserves, triacylglycerols (TAGs), and
   cholesterol were reduced in blood and probably used as a source of
   energy or synthesis in the digestive gland. The increase in digestive
   gland glycogen 24 h after the salinity shock evidenced the use of these
   reserves by shrimp fed with all diets. In general, after the salinity,
   shock blood cells increased in shrimp fed with glucans and decreased in
   shrimp fed with vitamin C, whereas ProPO decreased in all shrimp after
   the salinity shock. This could mean that after the salinity, shock
   shrimp fed with glucans could synthesize cells and ProPO, whereas in
   shrimp fed with vitamin C, blood cells were just used to respond to the
   stress. After the salinity shock, an increment in the ProPO/granular
   cell ratio was observed in shrimp fed with vitamin C, indicating that
   these shrimp could rapidly increase the components of their immune
   system. In contrast, a continuous reduction in ProPO/granular cell ratio
   was observed in shrimp fed with glucans, revealing that with this type
   of immunostimulant, shrimp drive their immunological equipment to
   respond continuously to the stress. These results could explain why
   shrimp fed with immunostimulants presents immunological fatigue in
   contrast to shrimp fed with additives that improve their nutritional
   status, like vitamin C. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Egg abundance of Anchoa mitchilli was studied in Laguna de Tamiahua,
   Veracruz during three annual cycles (84-85, 85-86 and 86-87). Our goal
   was to detect areas and seasons with high egg abundance and the possible
   association of such areas and seasons with covariates such as
   temperature, salinity, transparency, depth, location, season and year.
   The association was tested statistically using a Generalized Linear
   Model (GLM) with Gamma type error. The results suggest that not all the
   covariates considered have a significant effect on egg abundance
   (Student's T, p>0.005). The significant effects show the presence of a
   seasonal component and that the effect of salinity on egg abundance is
   conditional to location. High average egg abundances for the three
   annual cycles were observed during summer. The presence of significant
   interactions (Student's T, p<0.05) during the last two annual cycles
   shows that the variability of egg abundance is associated to surface
   temperature and salinity, conditionally to year.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {87-94},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The possibility of a high-temperature origin of life has gained support
   based on indirect evidence of a hot. early Earth and on the basal
   position of hyperthermophilic orizanisms in rRNA-based phylogenies.
   However, although the availability of more than 80 completely sequenced
   cellular genomes has led to the identification of
   hyperthermophilic-specific traits, such as a trend towards smaller
   genomes, reduced protein-encoding gene sizes, and glutamic-acid-rich
   simple sequences, none of these characteristics are in themselves an
   indication of primitiveness. There is no geological evidence for the
   physical setting in which life arose, but current models suggest that
   the Earth's surface cooled down rapidly. Moreover, at 100 degreesC the
   half-lives of several organic compounds, including ribose, nucleobases,
   and amino acids, which are generally thought to have been essential for
   the emergence of the first living systems, are too short to allow for
   their accumulation in the prebiotic environment. Accordingly, if
   hyperthermophily is not truly primordial, then heat-loving lifestyles
   may be relics of a secondary adaptation that evolved after the origin of
   life, and before or soon after separation of the major lineages.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to evaluate the role played by Alfonso Luis
   Herrera and Isaac Ochoterena in the institutionalization of academic
   biology in Mexico in the early 20th century. As biology became
   institutionalized in Mexico, Herrera's basic approach to biology was
   displaced by Isaac Ochoterena's professional goals due to the prevailing
   political conditions at the end of 1929. The conflict arose from two
   different conceptions of biology, because Herrera and Ochoterena had
   different discourses that were incommensurable, not only linguistically
   speaking, but also socioprofessionally. They had different links to
   influential groups related to education, having distinct political and
   socioprofessional interests. The conflict between Herrrera and
   Ochoterena determined the way in which professional biology education
   has developed in Mexico, as well as the advancement in specific research
   subjects and the neglect of others.},

   than the saturated vapor temperature, T-s, then generating a thin flow
   of condensate. The influence of both longitudinal and transverse heat
   conduction in the plate on the thickness evolution of the condensate,
   has been evaluated. The momentum and energy balance equations are
   reduced to a system of partial elliptic differential equations with four
   parameters. We present asymptotic formulae for the temperature,

Abstract = {The most important models before newtonian mechanics and the law of
   gravitation were stablished by Kepler and Copernicus. The relation
   between Newton's theory and Kepler's laws of planetary motion is widely
   discussed in textbooks; however, the relation with the model of
   Copernicus, where the position of a planet as a function of time is
   described as combination of circular motions, is usually avoided. In
   this work we use two simple and useful numerical techniques to show that
   this relation is easily performed. We use the algorithm of Verlet to
   solve the differential equations, not in polar coordinates as is usually
   done, but in cartesian coordinates, we also use the fast Fourier
   transform method to analyse the time series that in a natural way
   generate the deferent and epicicles of the Copernicus' model.},

Abstract = {The ground-state compressibility of the two-dimensional electron gas is
   determined for the density region which includes the fluid to localized
   phase transition. The behavior of the chemical potential mu(rho) across
   the transition agrees qualitatively with the experimental behavior near
   the B=0 metal-insulator transition reported in the literature. The
   calculations are made with the self-consistent Hartree-Fock
   approximation and the deformable jellium model.},

Abstract = {The historical existence of the RNA world, in which early life used RNA
   for both genetic information and catalytic ability, is widely accepted.
   However, there has been little discussion of whether protein synthesis
   arose before DNA or what preceded the RNA world (i.e. the pre-RNA
   world). We outline arguments of what route life may have taken out of
   the RNA world: whether DNA or protein followed. Metabolic arguments
   favor the possibility that RNA genomes preceded the use of DNA as the
   informational macromolecule. However, the opposite can also be argued
   based on the enhanced stability, reactivity, and solubility of
   2-deoxyribose as compared to ribose. The possibility that DNA may have
   come before RNA is discussed, although it is a less parsimonious
   explanation than DNA following RNA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {The existing approaches support Minkowski sums for the boundary,
   set-theoretic, and ray representations of solids. In this paper, we
   consider the Minkowski sum operation in the context of geometric
   modeling using real functions. The problem is to find a real function
   f(3)(X) for the Minkowski sum of two objects defined by the inequalities
   f(1)(X) greater than or equal to 0 and f(2) (X) greater than or equal to
   0. We represent the Minkowski sum as a composition of other operations:
   the Cartesian product, resulting in a higher-dimensional object, and a
   mapping to the original space. The Cartesian product is realized as an
   intersection in the higher-dimensional space, using an R-function. The
   mapping projects the resulting object along n coordinate axes, where n
   is the dimension of the original space. We discuss the properties of the
   resulting function and the problems of analytic and numeric
   implementation, especially for the projection operation. Finally, we
   apply Minkowski sums to implement offsetting and metamorphosis between
   set-theoretic solids with curvilinear boundaries. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Title = {Matrix metalloproteinases inhibition attenuates tobacco smoke-induced

Volume = {123},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Study objective: To evaluate the effect of CP-471,474 (Pfizer Global
   Research and Development; Groton, CT), a broad-spectrum inhibitor of
   matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in an experimental model of emphysema.
   Design: Randomized, double-blinded, controlled experiment.
   Setting: Biochemistry and morphology laboratories and animal research
   facility.
   Methods: Guinea pigs were exposed to cigarette smoke over 1 month, 2
   months, and 4 months, and half of the animals received CP-471,474.
   Age-matched guinea pigs exposed to room air were used as control
   animals. After death, the lungs were lavaged with saline solution, and
   MMPs in the lavage fluid were determined by zymography and immunoblot.
   Lungs were fixed for histology, immunohistochemistry, and morphometry.
   Results: Following a 1-month exposure to tobacco smoke, semiquantitative
   histologic assessment showed moderate lung inflammation, which
   progressed in extent and severity and reached a peak at 2 months.
   CP-471,474 significantly reduced both the extent (p < 0.002) and
   severity (p < 0.05) of inflammation at 2 months. At 4 months, a
   spontaneous reduction of the inflammatory response was observed in both
   treated and untreated animals, and consequently no difference was
   observed between both. Emphysematous changes, revealed by a significant
   increase in the average size of alveoli, were detected at 2 months and 4
   months of tobacco smoke exposure. The inhibitor significantly decreased
   the destructive lesions mainly at 2 months (p < 0.0001) and also at 4
   months (p < 0.02). Smoking increased MMP-9 and MMP-1 activities as shown
   by zymography and immunoblot. Immunoreactive MMP-9 was mainly localized
   in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and airways
   smooth-muscle cells.
   Conclusion: These findings support a role for MMPs in the early
   inflammatory response and in the emphysematous lesions provoked by
   cigarette smoking.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {164},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Lacandonia schismatica, a mycoheterotrophic, hermaphroditic
   monocotyledon endemic to the Lacandon rain forest of southeast Mexico,
   is the only flowering plant for which a spatial inversion (heterotopy,
   complete homeosis) of the reproductive floral whorls (stamens and
   carpels) is known to occur in natural populations. In order to
   investigate if this autapomorphic inside-out arrangement of the
   reproductive organs is fixed in natural populations, we have undertaken
   extensive and intensive fieldwork spanning several years to locate new
   populations in addition to the type locality. In parallel, we have also
   searched for natural variation in floral organ arrangement in Triuris
   brevistylis, a closely related dioecious triurid that is found in nearby
   areas of the Lacandon forest. We have found that a small proportion of
   L. schismatica inflorescences bear unisexual flowers of both sexes, as
   well as bisexual flowers with differences in the number of reproductive
   organs. However, in all bisexual flowers, the stamens were always
   central and the carpels peripheral to them. More important, we have also
   found that a few T. brevistylis individuals have bisexual flowers with
   altered positions of stamens and carpels. Among these, flowers with an
   inside-out L. schismatica-like floral organ arrangement were observed.
   We document our findings with scanning electron micrographs,
   histological sections, and dissection microscope views. The information
   presented implies that the developmental-genetic mechanism putatively
   responsible for homeotic/heterotopic transformations involving floral
   reproductive organs in the two triurid species originated at least
   before these taxa diverged from each other. The Mexican triurids may be
   an example in which the molecular evolutionary events causally related
   to a major morphological change in plants can best be understood at the
   microevolutionary scale.},

Abstract = {The plant vp1 gene encodes a transcription factor originally identified
   in maize that participates in the control of the transition from
   embryogenesis to seed germination. Different lines of evidence suggest
   that vp1 participates in preharvest sprouting (PHS) resistance in
   cereals, but the genetic relationship is not yet established. Thus, the
   aim of this study was to investigate if there is a connection between
   vp1 and the formerly documented quantitative trait loci for PHS in
   Sorghum bicolor. This gene was mapped in sorghum using two well-studied
   inbred lines displaying contrasting PHS phenotypes. Linkage analysis
   revealed that the S. bicolor vp1 (Sbvp1) locus is linked to markers
   located on chromosomes 3 and 8 in maize. Analysis indicated that this
   gene is not correlated with PHS at a statistically significant level.
   Structural analysis of the Sbvp1 gene from both inbred lines showed a
   high degree of overall conservation (low polymorphism), even in the
   promoter region. These findings, taken together with the previously
   observed correlation between the pattern of expression of this gene and
   PHS performance, suggest that Sbvp1 might act downstream in the
   signalling pathway that leads to seed germination, or even be
   differentially regulated as a consequence rather than as a cause of the
   phenotypic behaviour.},

Abstract = {The composition, abundance, species richness and structural changes of
   the planktonic polychaete assemblages were analysed along a latitudinal
   transect in the California Current System ( California, U. S. A. and
   Baja California, Mexico). The biological ( species and abundance) and
   physical ( temperature and salinity) data were analysed using Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA). The principal water masses in the survey area
   were determined. Twenty-four holoplanktonic species belonging to
   families Alciopidae, Iospilidae, Lopadorhynchidae, Tomopteridae and
   Typhloscolecidae were identified. Three clear species assemblages were
   discerned in the PCA results: 1. A `north group' (from Oregon-California
   border to San Francisco), with relatively high species richness (11) and
   the highest mean abundance (121 ind. per 500 m(3)) was characterised by
   Tomopteris septentrionalis, T. planktonis, Plotohelmis tenuis, and
   Travisiopis lobifera. California Current Water and Subtropical Central
   Water were present in the area occupied by this assemblage. 2. A `south
   group' (from off Bahia Magdalena to Cabo San Lucas), with the highest
   species richness (16), but low mean abundance (37.8 ind. per 500 m(3));
   it included tropical affinity species, such Lopadorhynchus henseni,
   Tomopteris nationalis, and Travisiopsis dubia. In concordance Surface
   Equatorial Water was identified in this region. 3. A `transition group'
   (between the north and south regions) recorded the lowest mean abundance
   (2.3 ind. per 500 m(3)) and species richness (9). Only the California
   Current Water was detected in this area. The spatial pattern of species
   richness found along of this transect, was at least, partially due to
   the planktonic productivity distribution in the epipelagic region and
   the influence of several water masses coming from different directions.},

Journal = {BOTANICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {69},

Pages = {173-203},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Although our biological knowledge regarding cactus species is thorough
   in many areas, only in recent years have ecologists addressed their
   demographic behavior. Here we attempt a first review of the present
   knowledge on cactus demography, including an analysis of the published
   information on species with different growth forms and life-history
   traits. Our review shows that cactus distribution ranges are determined
   by environmental heterogeneity and by species-specific physiological
   requirements. Temperature extremes may pose latitudinal and altitudinal
   distribution limits. At a more local scale, soil properties dramatically
   affect cactus distribution. Most cacti show a clumped spatial
   distribution pattern, which may be the reflection of a patchy resource
   distribution within their heterogeneous environments. The association of
   cacti with nurse plants is another factor that may account for this
   aggregated distribution. Many cacti grow in association with these
   perennial nurse plants, particularly during early life-cycle phases. The
   shade provided by nurse plants results in reduced evapotranspiration and
   buffered temperatures, which enhance cactus germination and
   establishment. In some cases a certain degree of specificity has been
   detected between particular cactus species and certain nurse plants. Yet
   some globose cacti may establish in the absence of nurse plants. In
   these cases, rocks and other soil irregularities may facilitate
   germination and establishment.
   Cacti are slow-growing species. Several abiotic factors, such as water
   and nutrient availability, may affect their growth rate. Competition and
   positive associations (i.e., mycorrhizae and nurse-cacti association)
   may also affect growth rate. Age at first reproduction varies greatly in
   relation to plant longevity. In general, cactus reproductive capacity
   increases with plant size. Populations are often composed of an uneven
   number of individuals distributed in the different size categories. This
   type of population structure reflects massive but infrequent recruitment
   events, apparently associated with benign periods of abundant rainfall.
   A few cactus species have been analyzed through the use of
   population-projection matrices. A total of 17 matrices were compiled and
   compared. Most of them reflect populations that are close to the
   numerical equilibrium (lambda = close to unity). Elasticity analyses
   revealed that the persistence of individuals in their current size
   category ({''}stasis{''}) is the demographic process that contributes
   the most to population growth rate. Also, adult categories (rather than
   juveniles or seedlings) show the largest contributions to lambda. No
   differences were apparent regarding this matter between cacti with
   different life-forms. This review shows that our knowledge of cactus
   population ecology is still incipient and rather unevenly distributed:
   some topics are well developed; for others the available information is
   still very limited. Our ability to preserve the great number of cactus
   species that are now endangered depends on our capacity to deepen our
   ecological understanding of their population processes.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-124},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We solve the problem of a Bose or Fermi gas in d-dimensions trapped by
   delta < d mutually perpendicular harmonic oscillator potentials. From
   the grand potential we derive their thermodynamic functions (internal
   energy, specific heat, etc.) as well as a generalized density of states.
   The Bose gas exhibits Bose-Einstein condensation at a nonzero critical
   temperature T-c if and only if d + delta > 2, along with a jump in the
   specific heat at T-c if and only if d + delta > 4. Specific heats for
   both gas types precisely coincide as functions of temperature when
   d+delta = 2. The trapped system behaves like an ideal free quantum gas
   in d + delta dimensions. For delta = 0 we recover all known
   thermodynamic properties of ideal quantum gases in d dimensions, while
   in 3D for delta = 1, 2 and 3 one simulates behavior reminiscent of
   quantum wells, wires and dots, respectively. Good agreement is found
   between experimental critical temperatures for the trapped boson gases
   Rb-87(37), Li-7(3), , Rb-85(37), He-4(2), K-41(19) and the known
   theoretical expression which is a special 37Rb Li Rb He 19 case for d =
   delta = 3, but only moderate agreement for Na-27(11) and H-1(1).},

Abstract = {A surface coil for MRI consisted of two concentric loops was developed
   to produce brain images with a commercial MR imager. Prior to build the
   coil prototype, the magnetic field (B-1) generated by the coil was
   numerically simulated. This field simulation is based on the Biot-Savant
   law for the circular- and square-shaped loop coils. From these
   theoretical results, we can appreciate an improvement on the B1
   homogeneity. Comparison of experimental SNR for a single-loop and dual
   concentric figure coils show that the latter has better sensitivity and
   uniformity. Phantom and brain images were obtained on a 1.5 Tesla
   clinical imager, and showed a good image quality. These brain images
   when compared against images obtained with a circular-shaped coil
   exhibit a better capability of penetration. This receiver coil can
   generate high quality brain images. This coil design can be used in
   clinical imagers and is compatible with conventional imaging sequences
   and protocols.},

Title = {c-fos and estrogen receptor gene expression pattern in the

Abstract = {Different studies in ovariectomized estrogen treated animals support the
   idea that c-fos plays a role in the proliferation of uterine epithelial
   cells. However, these studies invite us to reassess the role played by
   c-fos in epithelial cell types of the endometriurn during the estrous
   cycle. The present study was undertaken to determine the c-fos and
   estrogen receptor (ER) gene expression pattern in the rat uterine
   epithelium during the estrous cycle in which natural and cyclic changes
   of steroid hormones occur, and correlate these changes with the
   proliferation status of this cellular types. Proliferation was assessed
   during the estrous cycle using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation to DNA.
   ERalpha and beta proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The
   regulation of c-fos gene expression in the uterus of intact animals
   during the estrous cycle was evaluated using both in situ hybridization
   and immunohistochemistry. Estradiol (E-2) and progesterone (P-4) plasma
   levels were assessed by radioimmunoassay. The results indicated that
   luminal (LE) and glandular epithelia (GE) presented maximal
   proliferation during the metestrus (M) and the diestrus (D) days.
   However, during the proestrus (P) day only LE presented proliferation,
   and during the estrus (E) day only the stromal cells proliferated. A
   marked immunostaining for ERalpha was detected in both LE and GE cells
   during the early phases of the cycle but diminished on the P and the E
   day. In contrast, ERbeta was undetectable in both epithelia during all
   stages of the cycle. The highest c-fos mRNA level was detected in both
   epithelia on the M day, followed by a significant reduction during the
   other days of the cycle. The highest protein content was observed on the
   M and D days, and the minimal value was detected on the E day. The c-Fos
   protein level in LE was increased during M and D days, presenting a high
   correlation with the cellular proliferation pattern of this cell type.
   In conclusion, the overall results indicate that c-Fos protein presented
   a good correlation with uterine epithelial cell proliferation of LE. In
   the case of GE, the same tendency was observed, although no significant
   correlation was found. Both in LE and GE, c-fos mRNA did not strictly
   correlate with its protein levels. c-fos seems to have a
   postranscriptional regulation in uterine epithelial cells during the
   rat's estrous cycle. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in the freshwater crab,
   Pseudothelphusa americana, was studied in aquaria using infrared
   crossing sensors. Individuals with ablated eyestalks were compared with
   intact individuals in constant darkness (DD) and in light-dark cycles
   (LD). Our results showed that intact animals in DD displayed bimodal
   rhythms. In LD conditions the two peaks were associated with lights on
   and lights off, respectively. A significant difference in the free
   running periods before and after LD was observed in all intact animals.
   After eyestalk ablation (ES-X), the circadian rhythm of locomotor
   activity disappeared immediately, but reappeared several days later.
   Diurnal activity was seen in some ES-X animals when exposed to LD. Our
   results indicate that locomotor activity rhythm in P americana is driven
   primarily by oscillators located outside the eyestalks, and that
   extraretinal photoreceptors mediate either entrainment or masking
   effects.},

Abstract = {Oxyhemocyanin (OxyHc), blood protein, glucose, acylglycerol (AG), and
   lactate of Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles were investigated. Statistical
   analyses were done on baseline values for each metabolite and on OxyHc
   from shrimp cultured in outdoor (20-m(2) ponds) and indoor (90-1 tanks).
   The values obtained were compared with blood metabolites reported in the
   literature for L. vannamei maintained under similar conditions. Normal
   distribution was only found for samples from indoor shrimp. The
   distribution values for blood metabolites from shrimp cultured in
   outdoor ponds and indoor tanks were right or left skewed. OxyHc, blood
   proteins, and glucose levels were higher in shrimp cultured in outdoor
   ponds than those observed in shrimp maintained in indoor tanks. These
   differences were attributed to availability of live food in outdoor
   culture ponds. The OxyHc/protein ratio showed that 60\% of blood protein
   is OxyHc in outdoor-cultured shrimp and was lower than in
   indoor-cultured shrimp, and this ratio was lower than that found (97\%)
   in indoor-cultured shrimp. The type of food was identified as a dominant
   factor affecting blood metabolites. AG in outdoor-cultured shrimp was
   significantly lower than that observed in indoor-maintained shrimp.
   Blood lactate concentration of shrimp was not affected by the culture
   conditions. The blood levels for protein, glucose, and lactate reported
   here are similar to those reported previously for other crustacean
   species, indicating that these can be used as a reference for evaluating
   the physiological status of L. vannamei. When we compared the OxyHc,
   blood protein, glucose, and lactate levels of L. vannamei juveniles with
   other crustacean species, we observed that crabs, lobsters (low-activity
   species), and closed-thelycum shrimp species (mean-activity species) had
   lower values in comparison to those observed in open-thelycum shrimp
   species, including L. vannamei juveniles. Possibly the blood metabolites
   and OxyHc could be reflecting the morphological and physiological
   adaptation of crustaceans, because these metabolites will depend on
   energetic demands.},

Abstract = {Geographic patterns of variation in morphological characters in the
   Curve-billed Thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) have been recognized by
   the description of seven subspecies. Twelve standard measurements, as
   well as three colorimetric characters and two color pattern characters,
   were analyzed to test whether subspecies limits predict patterns of
   variation. Measurement error was addressed by measuring each character
   three times and calculating the mean. A total of 821 male study skins
   were used, representing 29 locations. A variety of analysis revealed two
   major groups, an eastern and western group, divided by the Sierra Madre
   Occidental. Those two groups had previously been recognized as the
   curvirostre and palmeri groups, respectively. Those groups were also
   recovered by analysis of mtDNA. The two groups fulfill the requirements
   for species. The Tiburon Island (T. c. insularis) sample was distinct
   for several characters; however, small sample size precludes formal
   taxonomic recommendation. Within the two major groups, most characters
   showed incongruent clinal patterns of variation that did not match
   subspecies limits.},

Abstract = {The stress of captivity could be the main reason for the loss of sperm
   quality of Litopenaeus setiferus (L) males in captivity. The aim of this
   study was focused on the physiological and immunological response of
   adult male shrimp exposed to a temperature extreme (33 degreesC in order
   to understand how the stress modulates the physiological, immunological
   and reproductive behavior of L. setiferus males. We used some blood
   metabolic variables, sperm quality and immune response as indicators of
   stress measured daily during the 10-day experiment. The high temperature
   provoked loss of osmotic capacity (OC), a reduction in blood metabolites
   at day 5, a reduction in hemocyte pro Phenoloxidase (proPO) activity and
   a dramatic reduction in sperm quality in comparison to that observed in
   freshly captured wild shrimp populations. The ratio between proPO and
   granular cells (small granular and large granular cells) (proPO/GC
   showed a cyclic behavior with lower peaks at days 3, 7 and 10 and high
   peaks at days 0, 5 - 6 and 8 - 9, evidencing migration and recovery of
   cells and proPO every 48 - 96 h, depending on the intensity of the
   stress. Such hemocyte migration was directed to the ampule and
   spermatophore where bacterial growth could be enhanced by abnormal and
   dead sperm cells. In such circumstances, a rapid mobilization of
   reserves could help to promote tissue regeneration in male testes and
   vas deferens. Such use of reserves could explain the reduction in blood
   metabolites observed at day 5 in present study. Although blood
   metabolites recovered after day 5, the loss of OC suggests that shrimp
   lose their osmotic homeostasis, possibly associated with the entrance of
   water due to inflammation of tissues provoked by melanization. (C) 2003

Abstract = {The effects of iron substitutions on the superconducting and structural
   properties of (Y0.8Pr0.2)Ba(2)Cu(4-x)FexO(8) were studied. As iron
   concentration increases, the rate,at which T. diminishes with x is the
   same as for the YBa2Cu4-xFexO8 system, but faster than in the
   YBa2Cu3-xFexO7-delta system. The Mossbauer spectra of the different
   samples, together with Rietveld refinements of their corresponding X-ray
   spectra, indicate that the iron atoms occupy preferably the Cu(1) sites
   of the double (CuO)(2) chains in fivefold coordination; that is, due to
   their tri-valency, the iron atoms attract extra oxygen atoms, named
   O(5), that place themselves along the a-axis in between two adjacent
   planes of the double (CuO)(2) chains. As x is increased, the Cu(1)-O(4)
   bond length decreases, whereas the Cu(2)-O(4) one increases. Also, a
   reduction of the occupation factors of the oxygen atoms in the CuO2
   planes is observed. Some of these changes may be due to the presence of
   O(5) atoms, which in turn affect the charge-transfer mechanism between
   the (CuO)(2) double chains and the CuO2 planes where superconductivity
   takes place, and could be responsible of the rate at which T-c
   decreases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To investigate repair mechanisms in bleomycin-induced pulmonary
   fibrosis, we used mice deficient in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
   (GGT(-/-)), a key enzyme in glutathione (GSH) and cysteine metabolism.
   Seventy-two hours after bleomycin (0.03 U/g), GGT-/- mice displayed a
   different inflammatory response to wild-type mice as judged by a near
   absence of neutrophils in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage and a
   less pronounced rise in matrix metalloproteinase-9. Inflammation in
   GGT(-/-) mice consisted mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages. At 1
   month, lungs from bleomycin-treated GGT(-/-) mice exhibited minimal
   areas of fibrosis compared with wild-type mice(light microscopy fibrosis
   index: 510 +/- 756 versus 1975 +/- 817, p < 0.01). Lung Collagen content
   revealed a significant increase in bleomycin-treated wild-type (15.1 +/-
   3.8 versus 8.5 +/- 0.7 mug hydroxy(OH)-proline/mg dry weight, p < 0.01)
   but not in GGT(-/-)(10.4 +/- 1.7 versus 8.8 +/- 0.8). Control lungs from
   GGT(-/-) showed a significant reduction of cysteine (0.03 +/- 0.005
   versus 0.055 +/- 0.001, p < 0.02) and GSH levels (1.24 +/- 0.055 versus
   1.79 +/- 0.065, p < 0.002). These values decreased after 72 hours of
   bleomycin in both GGT-/- and wild-type but reached their respective
   control values after I month. Supplementation with N-acetyl cysteine
   partially ameliorated the effects of GGT deficiency. These findings
   suggest that increased neutrophils and matrix metalloproteinase-9 during
   the early inflammatory response and adequate thiol reserves are key
   elements in the fibrotic response after bleomycin-induced pulmonary
   injury.},

Abstract = {When a cold catalyst is exposed to a fuel-oxygen mixture, the surface
   gets covered with the more effectively adsorbing species. When the
   temperature is increased, this species is desorbed and the ignition
   temperature is determined by the rate of desorption. Based on the
   equations for the heat balance, expressions were derived for the
   calculation of ignition temperature from the parameters of the
   experimental setup, the preexponential factor Ad and activation energy
   E-d of desorption, the ratio of sticking coefficients, and the ratio of
   adsorption orders of fuel and oxygen. Published experimental data for
   the catalytic ignition of CO, H-2, and CH4 were reinterpreted using the
   expressions obtained, and the following parameters were determined for
   polycrystalline platinum catalyst: E-d(H-2/Pt) = 43.3+/-5.2 kJ/mol,
   E-d(CO/Pt) = 107.2+/-12.7 kJ/mol, E-d(O-2/Pt) = 190 34 kJ/mol,
   S-H2,S-0/S-O2,S-0 = 36.7+/-9.6, S-CO,S-0/S-O2,S-0 = 41.2+/-8.5,
   S-O2,S-0/SCH4,0 = 5.9+/-0.3. Error limits refer to a confidence level of
   0.95. The activation energy of desorption for CO and O-2 and the ratio
   of zero coverage sticking coefficients of O-2 and CH4 are the first
   experimentally based determinations of these parameters. Experimental
   ignition temperatures could be reproduced assuming second-order `
   adsorption of CO, H-2, and O-2 on the Pt surface. These reaction orders
   have been debated in the literature.},

Abstract = {From March 1999 to August 2000, we used mist-netting, point counts, and
   radio-tracking to study habitat use, area requirements, and breeding of
   the Ivory-billed Woodcreeper Xiphorhynchus flavigaster in the tropical
   deciduous and semi-deciduous forest (arroyo forest) of the
   Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, western Mexico. The Ivory-billed
   Woodcreeper was a common, year-round resident. Breeding commenced at the
   end of the dry season (May) and continued during the rainy season
   through August. Our observations suggested that only the female builds
   the nest, incubates, and feeds nestlings. Ivory-billed Woodcreepers
   commonly foraged alone, but sometimes joined mixed-species flocks that
   passed through their territories, occasionally following army ant
   swarms. Home-range size varied from 6-36 ha, although most birds' home
   range was 15 ha or less. We did not find differences in home range size
   or mobility between the dry and rainy seasons, and we did not find a
   correlation between the size of the home range and the extent of
   semi-deciduous forest it included. We did not find evidence that
   suggested a greater use of semi-deciduous forest than of dry deciduous
   forest. We hypothesize that foraging habits and low competition could
   explain the lack of selection for semi-deciduous forest and the strong
   site fidelity exhibited by members of this species.},

Abstract = {Aim To analyse the distributional patterns of the Baja California
   Peninsula's resident avifauna, and to generate a regionalization based
   on a method that uses a parsimony analysis (parsimony analysis of
   endemicity, PAE) of point data and modelled potential distributions.
   Location The Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
   Methods A data base was constructed containing records of 113 species of
   resident terrestrial birds present in the Baja California Peninsula.
   Records and localities were obtained from the literature and from
   specimens housed in scientific collections world-wide. Raw data points
   and potential distribution maps obtained using the software Genetic
   Algorithms for Rule-set Prediction (GARP), were analysed with PAE.
   Results The data base consisted of 4164 unique records (only one
   combination of species/locality) belonging to 113 terrestrial resident
   bird species, in a total of 809 localities. From the point distribution
   matrix, the analysis generated 500 equally parsimonious trees, from
   which a strict consensus cladogram with 967 steps was obtained. The
   cladogram shows a basal polytomy and some geographical correspondence of
   a few resolved groups obtained in the analysis. These results do not
   allow the recognition of areas defined by avifaunistic associations.
   From the potential distribution matrix, the analysis generated 501
   equally parsimonious trees, and a strict consensus cladogram of 516
   steps was obtained. The cladogram shows a higher resolution because of
   the number of resolved groups with better geographical correspondence
   and therefore regions are well-defined.
   Main conclusions The correspondence of some groupings of species suggest
   their validity as areas with biogeographical (historical and/or
   ecological) meaning. This regionalization in the Baja California
   avifauna seems to be consistent with previous regionalizations for other
   groups. Hence, PAE is a useful tool for area categorization if reliable
   point records and prediction tools are available. Our results suggest
   that the geographical definition is much better using potential data
   generated by GARP, particularly when they are contrasted with the
   results from point data. Thus, this is an excellent alternative for
   developing biogeographical studies, as well as for improving the use of
   data from scientific collections and other sources of biodiversity
   information.},

Abstract = {Legumes can obtain nitrogen from symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root
   nodules. The glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle is
   responsible for the initial nitrogen assimilation. This work reports the
   analysis of transgenic Lotus japonicus plants with the chimeric gene
   containing the alfalfa cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS(1)) (EC
   6.3.1.2) gene controlled by the Sesbania rostrata leghemoglobin gene
   promoter (Sr glb 3p). Surprisingly, all of the transgenic primary
   transformants analysed were sterile. Two transformants designated GS39
   and GS44 were further analysed. GS in nodules of GS39 and GS44 plants
   was upregulated, at the level of transcript and protein. The transgenic
   plants had 2-fold higher nodule GS activity and similar root GS activity
   compared to control plants. The GS39 and GS44 sterile plants showed
   morphological alterations in pollen grains and in ovules. An increase in
   GS transcript abundance and enzyme activity was measured during early
   and late stages of flower development of GS plants. Flowers of GS plants
   showed higher glutamine content, resulting in an increased
   glutamine/glutamate ratio. The GS transcript and protein were detected
   in ovules. These data indicate that overexpression of GS(1) in
   reproductive organs critically affects their development and might be a
   reason for sterility of L. japonicus plants.},

Abstract = {Adult crayfish exhibit a variety of overt circadian rhythms. However,
   the physiological mechanisms underlying the overt rhythms are
   controversial. Research has centered on two overt rhythms: the motor
   activity and the retinal sensitivity rhythms of the genus Procambarus.
   The present work reviews various studies undertaken to localize
   pacemakers and mechanisms of entrainment responsible for these two
   rhythms in adult organisms of this crustacean decapod. It also describes
   an ontogenetic approach to the problem by means of behavioral,
   electrophysiological, and neurochemical experiments. The results of this
   approach confirm previous models proposed for adult crayfish, based on a
   number of circadian pacemakers distributed in the central nervous
   system. However, the coupling of rhythmicity between these independent
   oscillators might be complex and dependent on the interaction between
   serotonin (5-HT), light, and the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH).
   The latter compound has, up until now, not been considered as an agent
   in the genesis and synchronization of the retinal sensitivity rhythm.

Abstract = {It is very frequent to find comments and references to Galileo's work
   suggesting that he based his affirmations on a logic thought and not on

   that he realized and were unknown in the XVI and XVII centuries; in they
   we find a clear description of the methodology that Galileo follows in
   order to reach the results that he presents in his formal work,
   particularly in Discorsi. In contrast with the Aristotelian philosophy,
   in these manuscripts Galileo adopt a methodology with which he obtain
   great contributions for the modem conformation of the experimental
   method, founding so a methodology for the study of the movement. We use
   this analysis as an example of the difficulties that are present in the
   conformation of the modem experimentation and we point out the necessity
   to stress the importance of the scientific methodology in the teaching
   of physics.},

Abstract = {This work was carried out to study the antioxidant circadian system of
   two species of crayfish of different latitude origin. We investigated
   (1) whether both species possess glutathione circadian rhythms and (2)
   whether both species' rhythms differ in their ability to synchronize to
   24 h cycles. Two batches of Procambarus clarkii and P. digueti were kept
   in (1) light-dark (LD) 12:12 low irradiance (LI) cycles and then exposed
   to (2) 72 h of complete darkness, (3) LD 12:12 high irradiance (111),
   (4) LD 20:4 LI and (5) LD 20:4 HI for 2 weeks. The midgut and hemolymph
   were sampled and reduced and oxidized glutathione as well as glutathione
   reductase and glutathione peroxidase were assayed. Cosinor and analysis
   of variance revealed differences between both species. Procambarus
   clarkii robust antioxidant circadian rhythms are able to entrain to all
   conditions resetting to lights on or off. However, the P. digueti weak
   circadian glutathione system did not entrain to the LD cycles, showing a
   random distribution of phases. In this species, LD 12:12 and 20:4 HI
   evidenced significant daily rhythms indicating a damped circadian
   antioxidative system that is enhanced by the effect of light. This
   suggests that each species' photoperiodic history determines the
   adaptive abilities of the circadian antioxidative mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Using first principles total energy calculations we have studied the
   electronic properties of bulk Cu2O, clean and doped with Ag, Ni and Zn.
   The calculated ground state structure of clean Co2O is cubic. Its
   lattice constant a = 4.30 Angstrom, and bulk modulus B-0 = 108 GPa are
   in excellent agreement with experimental values a = 4.27 Angstrom, and
   B-0 = 112 GPa. In its ground state, Cu2O is a semiconductor material
   with a small direct band gap at the Gamma point. Our calculated value of
   similar to0.5 eV is smaller than the experimental value of similar to2.0
   eV, reflecting the problems of local density functional theory
   calculating the excited states. Doping with Ag, results in a reduction
   of the band gap. This result is important, since it implies that the
   band gap of Cu2O can be engineered by varying the amount of Ag in the
   crystal. Doping with Ni gives rise to a p-type semiconductor with the
   impurity levels above the valence band maximum, while doping with Zn
   results in a n-type semiconductor, with impurity levels above the
   conduction band minimum. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales

   statistical continuum models of superconductivity. From it four stable
   thermodynamic phases emerge around the BCS state, a normal and three
   stable Bose-Einstein condensed phases of which one is mixed (with both
   CP types) and two pure. Critical temperatures T-c for the new pure
   phases rise as one departs from the mixed BCS state, and can result in
   substantially higher T-c's than with BCS theory for moderate departures
   from perfect 2e/2h CP symmetry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {We describe a new species of Pseudoeurycea from the northern-most high
   peak of the Sierra de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico. This species belongs to
   the P. juarezi group, a monophyletic assemblage restricted to northern
   Oaxaca and comprising three species: P. juarezi, P. saltator, and P.
   aurantia sp. nov. Pseudoeurycea aurantia is the sister taxon to the
   clade formed by P. juarezi and P. saltator. The new species is diagnosed
   by a distinctive coloration and by divergent mitochondrial DNA
   sequences.},

Title = {NOVP chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease transiently induces sperm
   aneuploidies associated with the major clinical aneuploidy syndromes
   involving chromosomes X, Y, 18, and 21},
Journal = {CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2003},

Pages = {44-51},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine whether Novantrone,
   Oncovin, Velban, and Prednisone (NOW) combination chemotherapy for
   Hodgkin's disease increases the frequencies of the specific types of
   aneuploid sperm that might elevate the risk of fathering a child with
   one of the major clinical aneuploidy syndromes, i.e., Down (disomy 21
   sperm), Edward (disomy 18 sperm), Turner (nullisomy sex sperm), XYY
   (disomy Y sperm), triple X (disomy X sperm), or Klinefelter (XY sperm).
   A four-chromosome multicolor sperm fluorescence in-situ hybridization
   assay that simultaneously evaluates chromosomes 18, 21, X, and Y was
   applied to semen provided by four healthy men and to repeated samples of
   eight Hodgkin's disease patients before treatment, 35-50 days after
   treatment to examine the effects of treatment on male meiotic cells, and
   1-2 years after treatment to measure the persistence of damage. There
   were chromosome-specific variations in baseline frequencies and
   significant inductions of all of the detectable types of sperm
   aneuploidies: XY sperm (14-fold increase), disomy 18 (7-fold), nullisomy
   sex (3-fold), disomy 21 (3-fold), and disomy X and Y (similar to2-fold
   each). Disomy 21 was about twice as frequent as disomy 18, and neither
   showed a preferential segregation with a sex chromosome. Extrapolating
   across the genome, similar to18\% of sperm carried a numerical
   abnormality after NOW treatment of meiotic cells. Induced effects did
   not persist to 1-2 years after treatment, suggesting that persistent
   spermatogonial stem cells were not sensitive to NOW. These findings
   establish the hypothesis that conception shortly after certain
   chemotherapies can transiently increase the risks of fathering aneuploid
   pregnancies that terminate during development or result in the birth of
   children with major human aneuploidy syndromes.},

Abstract = {We developed an ellipse-shaped surface coil for magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy for a 1.5 T clinical MR Imager. This coil is to be used to
   obtain spectra from arms and legs. Standard volume and single-loop coils
   provide a poor signal because they can not be placed close to the region
   of interest and their shapes do not fit the anatomy of human
   extremities. The coil design proposed has more anatomical shape which
   allows to be placed closer to the region of interest. A higher
   signal-to-noise ratio can then be achieved resulting in better-quality
   spectra. Spectra from a phantom and from the arm of a healthy volunteer
   were acquired to show viability, A 1.5 T clinical scanner (Signa LX
   equipped with V. 5.8, General Electric Medical System) together with
   standard spin-echo sequences were used to perform all the spectroscopy
   experiments. This receiver coil can generate high resolution MR spectra
   of a spectroscopy phantom and is fully compatible with clinical magnetic
   resonance systems and standard pulse sequences.},

Abstract = {Results of earlier studies of Quaternary tephra-paleosol sequences in
   Central Mexico revealed contradictions between paleopedological and
   lacustrine records. To settle the contradictions, selected quantitative
   characteristics of mineral and organic components of the paleosols
   PT1-PT7 from the Nevado de Toluca sequence were studied as independent
   paleoclimate proxies. Mineralogical composition of sand and clay
   fractions allows assessment of weathering and secondary mineral
   formation, both being climate-dependent processes. Stable carbon isotope
   ratios of humus and phytolith morphology indicate paleovegetation. In
   all paleosols, the sand fractions consist mainly of unstable
   volcanogenic minerals, although the grains have weathering features.
   Short durations of pedogenesis are responsible for limited weathering
   status. The clay fraction is dominated by halloysite and dehydrated
   halloysite in units PT1-PT4, which suggests drier periods during
   paleosol formation, whereas major amounts of kaolinite in the units
   PT5-PT7 indicate extended humid pedogenesis. delta(13)C values of
   PT2-PT4 humus are intermediate between those characteristic of C3 and C4
   plants. Phytolith assemblages which include both forms of C3 (dominant)
   and C4 (minor quantities) grasses agree with carbon isotope data. These
   data indicate plant cover changes driven by wet/dry paleoclimate
   oscillations. The new results, showing drier stages during the formation
   of Late Pleistocene paleosols PT2 and PT3, correct the primary
   interpretation of these units as indicating only humid pedogenesis, and
   settles the contradiction between paleopedological and lacustrine
   records. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Several well-preserved arthropod faunas have been studied in Mexico
   during the past few years. The purpose of the present note is to outline
   advances in the study of these arthropods and of their
   paleoenvironmental implications, from four localities. The age for these
   localities ranges from the Early to the Late Cretaceous. At most of
   these localities lithographic limestones crop out, with fish remains
   representing the most attractive element of study. However, arthropods
   constitute a very important tool for reconstructing paleoenvironment
   (marine crustaceans, freshwater and terrestrial insects and arachnids).
   Detailed studies of these assemblages will aid in our understanding of
   ancient coastal dynamics and the paleoecology of these unique
   environments.},

Abstract = {By means of density functional theory the electronic structure of the
   MgB2 superconductor was characterized and compared with that of the

   full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method and the
   generalized gradient approximation, the electronic density distribution,
   density of states, and band structures were obtained for these
   compounds. The electrical conductivity, which cannot be easily measured
   in the c-direction, was calculated, in the relaxation time approximation
   using band structure results. It was found that the two-dimensional (2D)
   crystal structure character of these metallic diborides is also
   reflected in the electronic charge distribution. This 2D pattern is not
   reproduced in the electrical conductivity as it is, for instance, in the
   superconductor high T-c cuprates. The calculations indicate a bulk, yet
   anisotropic, conductivity for all these compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper studies the dynamics of the family lambda sin z for some

   values of lambda inside the unit disc. Then for values of lambda on the
   unit circle of parabolic type (lambda = exp(i2pitheta), theta = p/q, (p,
   q) = 1), we prove that if q is even, there is one q-cycle of Fatou
   components, if q is odd, there are two q cycles of Fatou components.
   Moreover the Fatou components of such cycles are bounded. For lambda as
   above there exists a component D-q. tangent to the unit disc at lambda
   of a hyperbolic component.
   There are examples for lambda such that the Julia set is the whole
   complex plane. Finally, we discuss the connectedness locus and the
   existence of buried components for the Julia set.},

Abstract = {The circadian rhythms of locomotor activity were studied in larvae and
   adult Fall Armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda, fed a nutritional diet
   (control) or a diet containing the maize variety CML67 (experimental).
   Activity was monitored using infrared-light crossings and rhythms were
   evaluated using actograms, average waveform, and X-2 periodograms.
   Results show that larvae grown on the experimental diet did not display
   conspicuous circadian rhythms in constant darkness before pupation and
   showed poor responses to light-dark cycles. Significant differences
   between the two groups were observed in their maximal activity and
   activity-rest ratios. Adults fed either diet displayed circadian rhythms
   of locomotor activity, however, differences were still found in their
   activity-rest ratios. Results obtained indicate that animals fed with
   diet containing the maize variety CLM67, have significant differences in
   the expression of circadian locomotor activity in larvae under constant
   darkness and in their responses to artificial light-dark conditions,
   suggesting that the maize variety CML67 may possess some active
   substance(s) that affect the maturation of the circadian system,
   controlling locomotor activity rhythms in larvae and adult armyworms.},

   combination of the following characters: large size (12-45 mm); presence
   of green, blue, and gold iridescent scales; antennae reaching base of
   prothorax, with second funicular article scarcely longer than first;
   widened frontal groove; pronotum as wide as long, granulate; elytra
   triangularly shaped; tibiae not crenulated or dentate within; scutellum
   protruding; and aedeagal apex slightly acute. It includes seven species,
   which are endemic to the Neotropics, ranging from Mesoamerica to
   northeastern Argentina. A cladistic analysis was carried out using 16
   characters from external morphology, body vestiture, and male genitalia.
   The analysis yielded four equally parsimonious cladograms, each with 33
   steps, a consistency index of 0.60, and a retention index of 0.53. After
   successive weighting, a single cladogram resulted, with 105 steps, a
   consistency index of 0.89, and a retention index of 0.90. According to
   this cladogram, the species of Entimus follow the sequence: E. arrogans
   Pascoe, E. granulatus (Linnaeus), E. imperialis (Forster), E. fastuosus
   (Olivier), E. sastrei Viana (= E. formosus Viana, syn. nov.), E. nobilis
   (Olivier), and E. excelsus Viana. According to predictions based on
   phylogenetic and distributional information available, the most likely
   mode of speciation for four species of the genus is sympatric, whereas
   E. arrogans and E. granulatus have followed an allopatric mode of
   speciation, and E. sastrei has followed the centrifugal mode of
   speciation.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a unique type of chronic
   fibrosing lung disease of unknown etiology. The sequence of the
   pathogenic mechanisms is unknown, but the disease is characterized by
   epithelial injury and activation, the formation of distinctive
   subepithelial fibroblast/myofibroblast foci, and excessive
   extracellular. matrix accumulation. These pathological processes usually
   lead to progressive and irreversible changes in the lung architecture
   resulting in progressive respiratory insufficiency and an almost
   universally terminal outcome in a relatively short period of time. While
   research has largely focused on inflammatory mechanisms for initiating
   the fibrotic response, recent evidence strongly suggests that disruption
   of the alveolar epithelium is an underlying pathogenic event. Although
   treatment to date has proved largely ineffective, this new approach has
   opened up several promising therapeutic avenues. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Variation in leaf traits of dominant tree species in six montane rain
   forest communities was analyzed along an elevational gradient ranging
   from 1220 to 2560 in within a single basin at La Chinantla, Oaxaca,
   Mexico. Three groups of characters were used: morphological (leaf shape,
   margin, blade configuration, and phyllotaxy), morphometric (leaf area,
   leaf mass per area, stomatal density, and blade length/width ratio), and
   anatomical (thicknesses of blade, palisade {[}PP], and spongy {[}SP]
   parenchymae, PP/SP ratio, and epidermis and cuticle thicknesses). The
   variation of morphological characteristics was only evident at the
   highest elevations; in contrast, thickness of leaf blade, Pp SP, as well
   as leaf mass per area clearly increased along the gradient, whereas leaf
   area was the only variable that significantly decreased with elevation.
   Thicknesses of epidermis and of the two cuticles were not significantly
   correlated with elevation. A classification analysis based on a leaf
   trait matrix led to the distinction between low and high elevation
   communities, with an approximate limit between them at ca 2300 to 2400
   in. The results are discussed in light of environmental changes
   occurring along elevational gradients. Leaf characteristics of montane
   rain forest plants offer important insights about the complex roles of
   abiotic Factors operating in these environments and supplement the
   traditional physiognomic classification schemes for these communities.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in experimental techniques have enabled the study of
   nuclei far from the line of stability in both the proton- and the

   we report the identification of gamma-rays in the near proton-drip line
   nuclei Pm-130 and Pm-132. In the second part, preliminary results of a
   systematic measurement of B(E2; 0(+) --> 2(+)) using novel
   CoulombExcitation techniques are presented for even-even isotopes of Ge
   and Se. The difficulties and challenges that represent the determination
   of the B(E2) values for the exotic neutron-rich nuclei Ge-78 and Ge-80
   are discussed. The measurement of these radioactive isotopes was
   possible thanks to the recent availability of radioactive ion beams at
   the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility. A comparison between the
   measured B(E2) values and theoretical predictions obtained with the IBA2
   model is also presented.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria associated with Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann larval
   habitats from southern Chiapas, Mexico, were isolated and identified
   from water samples and larval midguts using selective medium BG-11.
   Larval breeding sites were classified according to their hydrology and
   dominant vegetation. Cyanobacteria isolated in water samples were
   recorded and analyzed according to hydrological and vegetation habitat
   breeding types, and mosquito larval abundance. In total, 19
   cyanobacteria species were isolated from water samples. Overall, the
   most frequently isolated cyanobacterial taxa were Phormidium sp.,
   Oscillatoria sp., Aphanocapsa cf. littoralis, Lyngbya lutea, P.
   animalis, and Anabaena cf spiroides. Cyanobacteria were especially
   abundant in estuaries, irrigation canals, river margins and mangrove
   lagoons, and more cyanobacteria were isolated from Brachiaria mutica,
   Ceratophyllum demersum, and Hymenachne amplexicaulis habitats.
   Cyanobacteria were found in habitats with low to high An. albimanus
   larval abundance, but Aphanocapsa cf. littoralis was associated with
   habitats of low larval abundance. No correlation was found between water
   chemistry parameters and the presence of cyanobacteria, however, water
   temperature (29.2-29.4degreesC) and phosphate concentration (79.8-136.5
   ppb) were associated with medium and high mosquito larvae abundance. In
   An. albimanus larval midguts, only six species of cyanobacteria were
   isolated, the majority being from the most abundant cyanobacteria in
   water samples.},

Abstract = {The osmoregulatory response of the blue crab Callinectes rathbunae
   parasitized with the rhizocepbalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus, and
   subjected to sudden salinity changes, was experimentally measured in the
   laboratory. Parasitized and control crabs were exposed to salinity
   changes every 3 h and their hemolymph osmolality measured. Two
   experiments, one with increasing salinity conditions (5 \%, 12 \%, 19
   \%, 25 \%) and a second one with decreasing salinities (35 \%, 25 \%, 15
   \%, 5 \%) were conducted. The results show that L. texanus significantly
   alters the hemolymph osmolality of C rathbunae maintaining it at lower
   than normal levels. In the increasing salinity trial, the hypoosmotic
   hemolymph condition of parasitized crabs was present at all salinities
   tested, whereas in the decreasing salinity trial a significant effect
   was found only at salinities of 5 \% and 15 \%. Since C rathbunae is
   constantly subjected to abrupt salinity changes in the tropical
   estuaries where it occurs, moving into high salinity areas may be the
   only way to cope with, the impact of L. texanus. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {The preferred temperature (PT) of Poecilia sphenops (Pisces,
   Poeciliidae) (n = 240; 1.13 +/- 0.06 g wet weight; 3.26 +/- 0.88 cm
   standard length) from Presa Piedra Azul, Oaxaca, Mexico, was measured at
   acclimation temperature of 20 degreesC, 23 degreesC, 26 degreesC, 29
   degreesC, 32 degreesC and 35 degreesC. The thermal preference of males
   was 25.5 degreesC in summer and 29.6 degreesC in winter; whereas females
   preferred 29 degreesC in both seasons. Fish held at 20 degreesC and 23
   degreesC preferred temperatures 36\% higher than their acclimation
   temperature (AT), and those held at 35 degreesC and 32 degreesC
   preferred 30\% and 20\% lower temperatures than their AT. In
   intermediate temperatures, no significant differences between PT and AT
   were found. The interval of thermal selection based on the higher (HAT)
   and lower (LAT) avoidance temperatures was of 10-14 degreesC and not
   different between sexes in both seasons. Knowledge of the thermal
   biology of P. sphenops based on the preferred and avoidance temperatures
   was very important in order to understand the capacity of the species to
   adapt to the thermal changes occurring in its habitat. Based on the
   results, we can recommend the use of P. sphenops in aquaculture owing to
   its thermal plasticity.},

Abstract = {Stellar nucleosynthesis of heavy elements such as carbon allowed the
   formation of organic molecules in space, which appear to be widespread
   in our Galaxy. The physical and chemical conditions-including density,
   temperature, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and energetic
   particles-determine reaction pathways and the complexity of organic
   molecules in different space environments. Dense interstellar clouds are
   the birth sites of stars of all masses and their planetary systems.
   During the protostellar collapse, interstellar organic molecules in
   gaseous and solid phases-are integrated into protostellar disks from
   which planets and smaller solar system bodies form. After the formation
   of the planets 4.6 billion years ago, our solar system, including the
   Earth, was subjected to frequent impacts for several hundred million
   years. Life on Earth may have emerged during or shortly after this heavy
   bombardment phase, perhaps as early as 3.90-3.85 billion years ago, but
   the exact timing remains uncertain. A prebiotic reducing atmosphere, if
   present, predicts that building blocks of biopolymers-such as amino
   acids, sugars, purines and pyrimidines-would be formed in abundance.
   Recent modelling of the Earth's early atmosphere suggests, in contrast,
   more neutral conditions (e.g. H2O, N-2, CO2), thus, precluding the
   formation of significant concentrations of prebiotic organic compounds.
   Moreover, even if the Earth's atmosphere were reducing, the presence of
   UV photons would readily destroy organic compounds unless they were
   quickly sequestered away in rocks or in the prebiotic ocean. Other
   possible sources of organic compounds would be high temperature vent
   chemistry, although the stability of such compounds (bases, amino acids)
   in these environments remains problematic. Finally, organic compounds
   may have been delivered to the Earth by asteroids, comets and smaller
   fragments, such as meteorites and interplanetary dust particles.
   It is likely that a combination of these sources contributed to the
   building blocks of life on the early Earth. It may even have taken
   several starts before life surpassed the less than ideal conditions at
   the surface. What is certain is that once life emerged, it learned to
   adapt quickly taking advantage of every available refuge and energy
   source (e.g. photosynthesis and chemosynthesis), an attribute that
   eventually led to complex metabolic life and even. our own existence.
   Current experimental research investigating the origin of life is
   focused on the spontaneous formation of stable polymers out of monomers.
   However, understanding the spontaneous formation of structure is not
   enough to understand the formation of life. The introduction and
   evolution of information and complexity is essential to our definition
   of life. The formation of complexity and the means to distribute and
   store information are currently being investigated in a number of
   theoretical frameworks, such as evolving algorithms, chaos theory and
   modem evolution theory.
   In this paper we review the physical and chemical processes that form
   and process organic matter in space. In particular we discuss the
   chemical pathways of organic matter in the interstellar medium, its
   evolution in protoplanetary disks and its integration into solar system
   material. Furthermore, we investigate the role of impacts and the
   delivery of organic matter to the prebiotic Earth. Processes that may
   have assembled prebiotic molecules to produce the first genetic material
   and ideas about the formation of complexity in chemical networks are
   also discussed.},

Title = {Molecular evolution of the lysine biosynthetic pathways},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Pages = {445-459},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Among the different biosynthetic pathways found in extant organisms,
   lysine biosynthesis is peculiar because it has two different anabolic
   routes. One is the diaminopimelic acid pathway (DAP), and the other over
   the alpha-aminoadipic acid route (AAA). A variant of the AAA route that
   includes some enzymes involved in arginine and leucine biosyntheses has
   been recently reported in Thermus thermophilus (Nishida et al. 1999).
   Here we describe the results of a detailed genomic analysis of each of
   the sequences involved in the two lysine anabolic routes, as well as of
   genes from other routes related to them. No evidence was found of an
   evolutionary relationship between the DAP and AAA enzymes. Our results
   suggest that the DAP pathway is related to arginine metabolism, since
   the lysC, asd, dapC, dapE, and lysA genes from lysine biosynthesis are
   related to the argB, argC, argD, argE, and speAC genes, respectively,
   whose products catalyze different steps in arginine metabolism. This
   work supports previous reports on the relationship between AAA gene
   products and some enzymes involved in leucine biosynthesis and the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle (Irvin and Bhattacharjee 1998; Miyazaki et al.
   2001). Here we discuss the significance of the recent finding that
   several genes involved in the arginine (Arg) and leucine (Leu)
   biosynthesis participate in a new alternative route of the AAA pathway
   (Miyazaki et al. 2001). Our results demonstrate a clear relationship
   between the DAP and Arg routes, and between the AAA and Leu pathways.},

Abstract = {Procambarus llamasi is a crayfish species endemic to southeastern
   Mexico. Of all the portions of a species lifecycle to be understood,
   reproduction is the most vital. In order to better understand the effect
   of external factors on the reproductive development of P. llamasi, an
   experiment was done testing the influence of complete darkness (CD) and
   a natural light cycle (NL) on first maturity and egg laying. During the
   90-day experiment, three tanks were covered with dark plastic to prevent
   light from entering (complete darkness, CD), and another three were
   covered with transparent plastic to allow a natural light cycle
   (14L:12D, NL). Sexually immature juveniles were placed in the tanks and
   their growth and sexual maturation monitored. At the end of the
   experiment, the general spawning mean was 24\% for the CD treatment and
   15\% for the NL treatment. The maturation index was 4.04 for the CD and
   3.88 for the NL, and the gonadosomatic index was 3.90 for the CD and
   4.20 for the NL. In contrast to many other crayfish species, it is
   determined that complete darkness does not affect growth, survival or
   reproduction in P. llamasi. Reproductive development in this species may
   respond to other external factors such as hydrological cycles. (C) 2002

Title = {Triggered alternans in an ionic model of ischemic cardiac ventricular
   muscle},
Journal = {CHAOS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {807-818},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It has been known for several decades that electrical alternans occurs
   during myocardial ischemia in both clinical and experimental work. There
   are a few reports showing that this alternans can be triggered into
   existence by a premature ventricular contraction. Detriggering of
   alternans by a premature ventricular contraction, as well as
   pause-induced triggering and detriggering, have also been reported. We
   conduct a search for triggered alternans in an ionic model of ischemic
   ventricular muscle in which alternans has been described recently: a
   one-dimensional cable of length 3 cm, containing a central ischemic zone
   1 cm long, with 1 cm segments of normal (i.e., nonischemic) tissue at
   each end. We use a modified form of the Luo-Rudy {[}Circ. Res. 68,
   1501-1526 (1991)] ionic model to represent the ventricular tissue,
   modeling the effect of ischemia by raising the external potassium ion
   concentration ({[}K+](o)) in the central ischemic zone. As {[}K+](o) is
   increased at a fixed pacing cycle length of 400 ms, there is first a
   transition from 1:1 rhythm to alternans or 2:2 rhythm, and then a
   transition from 2:2 rhythm to 2:1 block. There is a range of {[}K+](o)
   over which there is coexistence of 1:1 and 2:2 rhythms, so that dropping
   a stimulus from the periodic drive train during 1:1 rhythm can result in
   the conversion of 1:1 to 2:2 rhythm. Within the bistable range, the
   reverse transition from 2:2 to 1:1 rhythm can be produced by injection
   of a well-timed extrastimulus. Using a stimulation protocol involving
   delivery of pre- and post-mature stimuli, we derive a one-dimensional
   map that captures the salient features of the results of the cable
   simulations, i.e., the \{1:1-->2:2-->2:1\} transitions with
   \{1:1<---->2:2\} bistability. This map uses a new index of the global
   activity in the cable, the normalized voltage integral. Finally, we put
   forth a simple piecewise linear map that replicates the \{1:1<---->2:2\}
   bistability observed in the cable simulations and in the normalized
   voltage integral map. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {We discuss an exactly soluble system, consisting of many independent
   objects with a structure, based on a very simple slave technique field
   theory. The Grand Canonical average quantities, such as the number of
   particles, energy, electric and magnetic polarization, of an ensemble of
   quantum objects in equilibrium with a reservoir of particles and energy,
   are derived in terms of the slaves instead of the electrons. The
   thermodynamic behavior, which depends on the parameters of the toy
   model, shows an interplay between several internal degrees of freedom.},

Abstract = {A review work on some of the most important aspects on relaxation
   phenomena that occur both in fragile and strong glass-formers is
   presented. In particular, different empirical forms for the logarithmic

   generalized stochastic matrix method in strong glasses and the behavior
   of the relaxation times are indicated. Special attention is given to the
   alpha and beta relaxation processes and the crossover between the
   different dynamical regimes that may be recognized in the vicinity of

Abstract = {The dryophthorid genus Rhinostomus Rafinesque (=Yuccaborus LeConte, new
   synonym) is a monophyletic taxon, defined by a combination of the
   following characters: mandibles exodont, antennal scape passing hind
   margin of eye, postocular lobes absent, abdominal punctures present,
   tibiae usually dentate, and third tarsal segment bilobed. It belongs to
   the pantropical tribe Rhinostomini Kuschel and is comprised of eight
   species. A cladistic analysis was carried out using 28 characters from
   external morphology, body vestiture, and male genitalia. The analysis
   yielded a single most parsimonious cladogram, with 59 steps, consistency
   index of 0.61, and retention index of 0.75, which was stable to
   successive weighting. According to this cladogram, the species follow
   the sequence: R. frontalis (LeConte, 1874) {[}=R. frontalis sharpi

Abstract = {The cornerstone of palaeoecological research, concerned with vegetation
   dynamics over the recent geological past, is a good understanding of the
   present-day ecology and distribution of the taxa. This is particularly
   necessary in areas of high floral diversity such as Latin America.
   Vegetation reconstructions, based on numerous pollen records, now exist
   with respect to all major vegetation associations from Latin America.
   With this ever-increasing number of sedimentary records becoming
   available, there is a need to collate this information and to provide
   information concerning ecology and distribution of the taxa concerned.
   The existing Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) meets the first of
   these needs. Information concerning the ecology and distribution of the
   parent taxa responsible for producing the pollen, presently lodged
   within the LAPD, is the focus of this paper. The `dictionary' describes
   the ecology and distribution of the parent taxa responsible for
   producing pollen identified within sedimentary records. These
   descriptions are based on a wide range of literature and extensive
   discussions with members of the palaeoecological community working in
   different parts of Latin America investigating a range of different
   vegetation types. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mexican cloud forest vegetation has been recorded in temperate humid
   conditions at rather different elevations ranging from 600 to 3000 m.
   They are characterised by high biodiversity under continuous foggy
   situations. Some authors state that many genera are quantitatively
   important to depict cloud forest conditions. Detailed quantitative
   studies comprising most of the localities of Mexican cloud forests to
   depict altidudinal distribution ranges on basis of preferential genera
   have not been previously conducted. The aim of this study is (1) to
   recognise characteristic preferential genera of Mexican cloud forest
   conditions, and (2) to determine quantitatively the current altitudinal
   distribution pattern of this vegetation type. From a database composed
   by 995 genera inhabiting in the Mexican cloud forests, six genera were
   chosen preliminary as preferential characteristics. These were Clethra,
   Magnolia, Meliosma, Styrax, Symplocos, and Ternstroemia. These genera
   include 70 species that occur at over 70\% of the current Mexican cloud
   forest fragments. The mean elevation of these genera records were 1853 m
   (+/- 600 at 95\% confidence interval). The results showed that Mexican
   cloud forests occur optimally between 1250 and 2450 m. Additionally,
   Mexican cloud forest is the best distributed within some provinces of
   the ``Region Mesoamericana de Montana{''}, chiefly at ``Serranias
   Meridionales{''}, ``Sierra Madre Oriental{''}, and ``Serranias
   Transistmicas{''}. The results are discussed in light of the importance
   of these regions as diversification centres.},

Abstract = {An inventory of land-cover conditions throughout Mexico was performed
   using North American Landscape Characterization ( NALC) Landsat
   Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) `triplicate' images, corresponding to the
   1970s, 1980s and 1990s epoch periods. The equivalent of 300 image scenes
   were analysed using an unsupervised classification approach by a
   consortium of 13 universities and institutes across Mexico. Accuracy
   assessments were conducted to validate the 1970s and 1990s results using
   independent land-cover classifications (reference data) developed from
   the interpretation of 1: 100 000-scale aerial photography collected in
   1973, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery collected between 1990
   and 1993. The 1980s epoch classifications were compared with both
   reference datasets, collectively. The relative accuracy of the
   classifications results were 60\% for both the 1970s and 1990s epoch and
   67\% for the 1980s epoch. The significantly ( p= 0.05) higher accuracy
   for the 1980s epoch ( 67\%) was thought to be an aberration resulting
   from the combined application of two reference datasets, resulting in a
   random compensation of reference data error. Significantly different (
   p= 0.05) results were documented for a subset of Mexico's major habitat
   regions. Desert and xeric shrublands were most accurate (74\%), followed
   by conifer and xeric dominated habitats (64\%) and other mixed habitats
   (54\%). Scenes representing the highest accuracies ( 15 percentile)
   almost exclusively represented desert and xeric shrub habitat regions,
   and the lowest (17 percentile) represented predominantly mixed habitat
   regions.
   Significant differences among the 13 member consortium universities and
   institutes were attributed to habitat region assignments. Results
   indicated that large area spectral based land-cover categorizations
   should be stratified and processed on a habitat or ecoregion basis.
   Results also suggested that any future land-cover conversion analysis
   for Mexico would probably best be accomplished using a
   post-classification approach, based on major habitat regions, rather
   than on a scene-by-scene or pixel-wise basis.},

Title = {Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) of Mexican terrestrial mammals at

Abstract = {Aim Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) is a biogeographical method
   that uses a parsimony algorithm to obtain an area cladogram, based on
   taxa inhabiting the study areas. We compare its performance at different
   geographical units (1/2degrees and 1degrees quadrats, ecoregions and
   biogeographical provinces) to analyse distributional patterns of Mexican
   terrestrial mammals, in order to assess the importance of the size of
   area units.
   Location The area analysed corresponds to Mexico.
   Methods Parsimony analyses were based on 56,859 collection records,
   corresponding to 703 genera, species and subspecies. Four data matrices
   were constructed for: (1) 716 quadrats of 1/2degrees latitude x
   1/2degrees longitude, (2) 230 quadrats of 1degrees latitude x 1degrees
   longitude, (3) forty-five ecoregions and (4) fourteen biogeographical
   provinces.
   Results For the 1/2degrees quadrat matrix, we obtained six cladograms of
   17,138 steps. For the 1degrees quadrat matrix, we obtained five
   cladograms (strict consensus with 9394 steps). For the matrix of
   ecoregions, we obtained twelve cladograms (strict consensus cladogram
   with 3009 steps). For the provinces, we obtained a single cladogram with
   1603 steps.
   Main conclusions The best results were obtained with natural areas
   instead of quadrats. There seems to exist a trend to decrease the
   absolute number of steps and an increase in the absolute and relative
   number of synapomorphies as the size of the area units decreases,
   although this does not necessarily occur for the number of cladograms.},

Title = {Molecular mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {D1743-D1761},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is the end-point of a numerous and heterogeneous
   group of disorders known as interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Lung
   fibrotic remodeling is characterized by fibroblast/myofibroblast
   activation, and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation leading to
   progressive organ dysfunction and usually terminal outcome. Treatment is
   largely ineffective primarily because few of the molecular mechanisms
   have been well defined to design appropriate targets for therapy. While
   the pathogenesis is incompletely understood, a growing body of evidence
   suggests two different pathogenic routes for developing pulmonary
   fibrosis. The inflammatory pathway, where a shift to the so-called
   T-helper 2 type cytokine networks is critical, and the epithelial
   pathway represented by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, by far the most
   aggressive ILD. In this pathway the inflammatory process is irrelevant,
   and the physiopathology seems to be dominated by epithelial cell injury
   and activation. Both routes may trigger a number of cytokines/growth
   factors inducing fibroblast migration/proliferation and phenotype change
   to myofibroblasts, with a consequent accumulation of extracellular
   matrix. An imbalance in matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitors of
   metalloproteinases may contribute to alteration in extracellular matrix
   turnover and remodeling. This review will focus in some of the
   mechanisms involved in both prefibrotic pathways, as well as those
   involved in fibroblast activation and abnormal matrix deposition.},

Abstract = {Microbound feeds have been well accepted by shrimps and farmers in many
   penaeid shrimp hatcheries. The present study focused on an adequate
   level of replacement of Artemia nauplii and microalgae by a microbound
   diet for rearing Litopenaeus setiferus (Burkenroad) larvae. A microbound
   diet (MBD) consisting of fishmeal, squid meal, shrimp meal, yeast meal
   and soybean meal was used. The first experiment was designed to obtain
   the optimum level of MBD to complete the live feeding schedule, from
   Protozoea (PZ(III) ) to Mysis (M-III ). The experimental levels of the
   microbound diet tested were 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg MBD L-1 day(-1) . The next
   step was to determine the Artemia nauplii replacement level from PZ(I)
   to M-III by MBD. These experiments were carried out either in the
   presence (Experiment 2) or in the absence of algae (Experiment 3). Four
   replacement levels were tested: 0\% (4 mg MBD L-1 day(-1) : 1 Artemia
   nauplii mL(-1) ), 40\% (5.5 mg MBD L-1 day(-1) : 0.6 Artemia nauplii),
   60\% (6.5 mg MBD L-1 day(-1) : 0.4 Artemia nauplii) and 100\% (8 mg MBD
   L-1 day(-1) : 0 Artemia nauplii). In all experiments growth, survival,
   development, quality index (QI) and performance index (PI), were used to
   determine the optimum concentration of microbound diet. Results showed
   that 6 mg MBD L-1 day(-1) can be recommended as a complement to live
   food for L. setiferus larvae from PZ(III) to M-III . In the presence of
   algae, maximum growth and survival may be obtained in 40-60\% (5.5-6.5
   mg MBD L-1 day(-1) ) of Artemia nauplii replacement levels. In the
   absence of algae, the Artemia nauplii replacement resulted in slower
   development, less salinity resistance, lower growth and lower survival
   than was obtained in larvae fed with algae.},

Abstract = {Because environmental factors play an important role in the sexual
   proportions in fish and given that the studies that evaluate the
   interactions of such factors are scarce, the purpose of this work was to
   determine the combined effect of pH/temperature (23, 26 and 29 degreesC;
   pH 6, 7 and 8) on sex determination of Poecilia sphenops Valenciennes.
   The trial started with newborn organisms (n = 180) that were maintained
   in aquaria for 6 months until they could be separated by sex.
   Afterwards, nine groups of four females (0.81-1.48 g) and two males
   (0.36-0.63 g) were distributed in 20-L aquaria until fertilization,
   gestation and offspring birth took part. The offspring were grown under
   the same conditions until they reached sexual maturity. The results
   indicated the strong interaction of the factors (P < 0.05) with a lower
   male/female ratio at pH 7 both at 23 degreesC (M/F = 0.12) as well as at
   30 degreesC (M/F = 0.10) and higher ratios at pH 8 at similar
   temperatures (M/F = 0.7) to 23 degreesC and (M/F = 0.6) to 26 degreesC.
   The females dominated in all the combinations; the least favourable
   combinations were 23 and 26 degreesC at pH 8 with 0.7 and 0.6 M/F ratios
   respectively. The results obtained in the laboratory explain very
   closely the behaviour of the population of P. sphenops from Oaxaca in
   the natural environment that can be used in aquaculture for baitfish
   production and also for aquaculture purposes.},

Abstract = {The conjugated heat conduction process of a continuously moving flat
   sheet emerging from a slot or orifice in contact with a quiescent fluid
   is analyzed. Because of the finite thermal conductivity of the sheet,
   longitudinal and transverse temperature gradients arise within it and,
   thus, change the mathematical character of the problem from parabolic to
   elliptic. The momentum and energy balance equations are reduced to a
   nonlinear system of partial differential equations with three
   parameters: the Prandtl number Pr, a nondimensional sheet thermal
   conductance beta, and a suitable Peclet number Pe. The limits beta << 1
   and beta Pe(2) << 1 are identified as the most relevant from a practical
   point of view. In this case, the problem is governed by an universal
   integral equation to obtain the spatial evolution of the sheet
   temperature as a function of the nondimensional longitudinal coordinate.},

   bitegmic, exostomous, and terminucellate, each with a four-celled
   monosporic embryo sac of the Apinagia type. Disintegration of the
   nucellus into a plasmodium takes place prior to fertilization. Embryo
   sac development of Vanroyenella is similar to other members of the
   Podostemoideae subfamily. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Lower Mississippian (Osagean) brachiopods from the Santiago Formation,
   Oaxaca, Mexico:: stratigraphic and tectonic implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Four species of spiriferid brachiopods from the Santiago Formation of
   Oaxaca are described. The species described belong to the orders
   Athyridida (Actinoconchus lamellosus), Spiriferida (Torynifer
   pseudolineatus), and Spiriferinida (cf. Syringothyris sp. and
   Punctospirifer gigas new species).
   The association between A. lamellosus and T. pseudolineatus indicates an
   Early Mississippian (Osagean) age for the Santiago Formation. The
   Carboniferous succession in the area was originally divided into the
   Santiago Formation (formed by lower and upper members) and the
   Ixtaltepec Formation. The studied fauna belongs to the lower member of
   the Santiago Formation. Because Pennsylvanian brachiopods were found in
   strata of the upper member, it is now considered to have more affinity
   with the Ixtaltepec Formation. Therefore, we propose a change in the
   stratigraphy of the area to include the upper member of the Santiago
   Formation in the Ixtaltepec Formation. This change in the stratigraphy
   is supported because a major low-angle normal fault places the former
   upper member of the Santiago Formation on the lower member and indicates
   a tectonic contact between both members of the original Santiago
   Formation.
   Brachiopods from the Santiago Formation are similar to those in the
   Midcontinent province located in the eastern and central regions of the
   United States. The affinity of these Mississippian faunas has important
   tectonic implications, because Ordovician and Silurian faunas of
   Oaxaquia have strong biogeographic affinities with Gondwanan-European
   provinces. Therefore, there may have been a geographic connection
   between southeastern Mexico and North America during Lower Carboniferous
   times. This could change previous interpretations, which suggest that
   the collision of Oaxaquia with North America occurred during Permian
   time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We evaluated by immunohistochemistry the expression of progesterone
   receptor (PR) isoforms in different cell subpopulations of the ovary of
   newly-hatched chicks after a treatment with Follicle-stimulating hormone
   (FSH) or Luteinizing hormone (LH) administered on days 13, 15 and 17 of
   embryonic development. Two monoclonal antibodies that recognize either
   both PR isoforms or only PR-B, were used. The results indicate that FSH
   increased both the total number of cells and the number of
   PR-immunoreactive ones in all cell subpopulations of the ovary. In all
   cases, PR-B was the isoform regulated by FSH. In contrast, LH did not
   modify the number of total cells in any cell subpopulations of the
   ovary. Besides, LH decreased the number of PR-B immunoreactive
   interstitial cells, without modifying PR expression in any other cell
   subpopulations of the ovary. These results reveal differential effects
   of FSH and LH on PR-expression in cell subpopulations of the ovary of
   newly hatched chicks treated during embryonic development. We conclude
   that gonadotropins regulate PR-B isoform in the prefollicular ovary of
   the chick. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Precursor structures of various members of the neuropeptide family
   adipokinetic hormone/red pigment concentrating hormone (AKH/RPCH) of
   mandibular arthropods and the APGWamide family of mollusks were
   compared. Amino acid alignments showed a common overall architecture
   (signal peptide, active peptide, related peptide), with a similar a
   helix-random coil secondary structure. DNA sequence alignments revealed
   close similarities between the genes encoding for the peptides of the
   two families. The APGWamide genes are larger than the AKH/RPCH genes.
   The sequence environment occupied by introns is similar in AKH/RPCH and
   APGWamide genes. Such similarities suggest that these peptide families
   might have been originated by gene rearrangements from a common ancestor
   having either an AKH/RPCH/APGWamide-like structure or both an
   AKH/RPCH-like and an APGWamide-like structures. In the former model, DNA
   fragments could have been gained when the ancestor evolved to mollusks
   and it could have lost nucleotides when the progression to mandibular
   arthropods took place. In the second model, AKH/RPCH-like structures
   could have been fused during evolution toward mandibular arthropods.
   whereas in mollusks they could have been lost with the possible
   amplification of the APGWamide-like structure. Loss of domains in exon 1
   may have originated the signal peptide and the first codon of the active
   RPCH. in exon 2. loss of domains possibly determined the junctions of
   codons 2 to 5 with the loss of a APGWamide copy; exon 3 underwent fewer
   variations. The similarity of the mollusk APGWamide precursors is closer
   to that of the RPCH family than the insect AKH family, indicating an
   earlier evolutionary departure.},

Abstract = {The hypoglycemic effect of a water extract from aerial parts (0.33 g/kg)
   of Equisetum myriochaetum Schlecht and Chain (Equisetaceae) was analyzed
   in 11 recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. A single dose of this
   extract was orally administered. Glucose and insulin were determined at
   0, 30, 60, 90,120 and 180 min after administration. The same patients
   served as the control group and received only colored water as placebo.
   The administration of the extract significantly reduced the blood
   glucose levels of the type 2 diabetic patients within 90, 120 and 180
   min. There were no significant changes in the insulin levels. The
   results demonstrate that the water extract of the aerial parts of E.
   myriochaetum shows a hypoglycemic effect in type 2 diabetic patients
   starting 90 min after its administration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and largely untreatable group of
   disorders that affects up to 100,000 people on any given day in the
   United States. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to
   end-stage human pulmonary fibrosis we analyzed samples from patients
   with histologically proven pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial
   pneumonia) by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression
   patterns clearly distinguished normal from fibrotic lungs. Many of the
   genes that were significantly increased in fibrotic lungs encoded
   proteins associated with extracellular matrix formation and degradation
   and proteins expressed in smooth muscle, Using a combined set of scoring
   systems we determined that matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase 7), a
   metalloprotease not previously associated with pulmonary fibrosis, was
   the most informative increased gene in our data set. Immunohistochemisry
   demonstrated increased expression of matrilysin protein in fibrotic
   lungs. Furthermore, matrilysin knockout mice were dramatically protected
   from pulmonary fibrosis in response to intratracheal bleomycin. Our
   results identify matrilysin as a mediator of pulmonary fibrosis and a
   potential therapeutic target. They also illustrate the power of global
   gene expression analysis of human tissue samples to identify molecular
   pathways involved in clinical disease.},

   case of monoenergetic, quantum dispersion process. Diffraction in time
   is extended to include new initial conditions, which under free

   analogy to spatial diffraction patterns found in optics. We show that
   free propagation of states, which initially are stationary states of
   infinite potential wells, diffract in time similarly as a plane wave by

Abstract = {It has been well recognized that epithelial cells of the rat endometrium
   cyclically proliferate and die during the estrous cycle. The aim of the
   present study was to determine p53 expression pattern and correlate it
   with the the apoptotic pattern of epithelial cells of the rat uterus
   during the estrous cycle. The p53 mRNA and protein expression pattern
   was assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The
   apoptotic index was determined by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
   transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and electron
   microscopy, The highest p53 mRNA content, detected by in situ
   hybridization, was observed on the metestrus day both in the luminal and
   the glandular epithelia. During this period both epithelia presented
   high proliferation, The content of p53 mRNA markedly decreased in the
   following days, presenting its minimal values on the estrus day. The
   highest number of p53 immunopositive nuclei, in both the luminal and the
   glandular epithelia, was also detected on the metestrus day, while the
   lowest one was found on estrus day. On the proestrus day, p53 protein
   was predominantly detected in the glandular epithelium. However, on the
   estrus day, p53 protein was detected both in the nuclei and in the
   cytoplasm of luminal epithelial cells, predominantly in the cytoplasm.
   The highest apoptotic index in both the luminal and the glandular
   epithelia was observed on the estrus day whereas the lowest one was
   observed on the proestrus day. The apoptotic index values were higher in
   the luminal than in the glandular epithelia. The overall results
   indicate that p53 expression at both mRNA and protein levels is higher
   on the metestrus day when the apoptotic index is low. This suggests that
   p53 should play an important physiological role during proliferative
   phases of the estrous cycle in the rat uterus, (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A thermal procedure and an ab initio molecular-dynamics method based on
   the Harris functional, applied to originally crystalline, periodically
   continued 64-atom cubic cells, is used to generate random networks of
   four different materials of varying degrees of covalency: C, Si, Ge, and
   a nearly stoichiometric sample of Si-N. We obtain their radial
   distribution functions (RDF's) for four different time steps, one for
   each material, using densities dictated by experiment. The simulated
   RDF's for amorphous C, Si, and Ge show the four characteristic radial
   peaks observed experimentally. For the nearly stoichiometric SiN1.29
   sample two runs were performed and averaged. The agreement between
   simulated and experimental RDF's is very good.},

Abstract = {Local biological communities are made up of species, each of which has

   extension community composition, models of species' ecological niches
   can predict species composition at particular sites, or at least provide
   a null hypothesis of potential species composition in the absence of
   effects of species interactions. We developed distributional predictions
   (ecological niche models) for 89 species occurring in dry tropical
   forest in the Balsas Basin of south-western Mexico using an
   interpolation technique, and predicted the species likely to occur at 8
   sites across the region. Onsite field inventory data were then used to
   test the community predictions, all of which were statistically
   significant. These results suggest that inventory efforts can be made
   more efficient by development beforehand of hypotheses that focus onsite
   collecting and inventory.},

Abstract = {Given p is an element of beta(w) \textbackslash{} w, we determine when a

   particular, we analyze the product of quasi-p-pseudocompact subspaces of
   beta(w) containing w. We give examples of spaces X, Y, X-s, Y-s which
   are quasi-p-pseudocompact for every p is an element of w{*}, but X x Y
   is not pseudocompact, and X-s x Y-s is pseudocompact and it is not
   quasi-s-pseudocompact for each s is an element of w{*}. Besides, we
   prove that every pseudocompact space X of beta(w) with w subset of X, is
   quasi-p-pseudocompact for some p is an element of w{*}. Finally, we
   introduce, for each p is an element of w{*}, the class P-P of all spaces
   X such that X x Y is quasi-p-pseudocompact when so is Y; and we prove:
   (1) the intersection of classes P-p (p is an element of w{*}) coincides
   with the Frolik class; (2) every class P-P is closed under arbitrary
   products; (3) the partial ordered set (\{P-p : p is an element of

   free ultrafilters on w with the Rudin-Keisler order. A topological
   characterization of RK-minimal ultrafilters is also given.},

Abstract = {Several structurally related anisidine and dibenzanthracene isomers were
   evaluated for genotoxic effects in the somatic w/w + assay of Drosophila
   melanogaster employing insecticide-susceptible (IS) and
   insecticide-resistant (IR) tester strains. In addition, and in order to
   find whether or not at the genetic level a regulatory effect is found,
   crosses between IS x IR strains and IR x IS strains were done. Chemicals
   tested were the aromatic amines (AAs) ortho-anisidine (o-AN),
   meta-anisidine (m-AN), and para-anisidine (p-AN) and the polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 1,2;3,4-dibenzanthracene (1,2;3,4-DBA) and
   1,2;5,6-dibenzanthracene (1,2;5,6-DBA). As positive control
   N-nitrosodimethylamine (DMN) was used. Our results show that the
   genotoxic activity of DMN was higher in the IR than in the IS strain.
   There seems to be a tendency for slightly lower values as measured by
   clone induction in crosses between IS x IR and IR x IS. o-AN was
   positive in the IS strain and in crosses between IS x IR and IR x IS but
   negative in the IR strain. in-AN, p-AN and 1,2;3,4-DBA proved to be not
   recombinogenic in all strains and crosses while 1,2;5,6-DBA was positive
   at the highest concentration tested in all the crosses assayed. These
   findings show that the recombinogenic activity of the anisidine isomers
   depends on the position of the chemical group relative to one another
   and that the position of the benzene ring seems to be structurally
   relevant for genotoxicity of DBA isomers. With respect to IR and IS
   strains it remains to be determined to what extent the spectrum of
   metabolizing capacity really differs between the strains of the test
   assay. Thus more information is needed about the regulation and
   expression of the cytochrome-P450 genes and action at the molecular
   level taking place in the eye imaginal disc as well as between
   insecticide susceptible and resistant strains after exposure to
   genotoxic chemicals. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {The authors used the reverse hemolytic plaque assay to investigate
   whether single retinal and optic lobe cells of juvenile and adult
   crayfish secrete crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) and whether the
   secretion rate depends on extracellular serotonin (5-HT) concentration.
   Nearly 25\% of individual retinal and optic lobe cells of juvenile and
   adult organisms secrete CHH in response to KCl depolarization. In this
   condition, CHH secretion increased as a function of 5-HT concentration.
   In both cases, the dose-response curve indicates two different
   populations of CHH-secreting cells. juveniles showed a higher CHH
   secretion index than did adult organisms, demonstrating a developmental
   interstage variation of CHH secretion. The authors conclude that (1)
   retinal CHH-secreting cells correspond to a population of retinal
   tapetal cells and (2) optic lobe CHH-secreting cells correspond to two
   subpopulations of CHH of medulla terminalis-X organ. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {An energetic and conceptual model of the physiological role of dietary
   carbohydrates and salinity on Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {268},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {We are reporting results directed to explain the relation between
   carbohydrates (CHO), protein metabolism, and the energetic balance of
   Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles. The interaction of dietary CHO and
   salinity was measured to try to understand the relation between osmotic
   control and metabolism, both from a biochemical and energetic point of
   view. Two experiments were done. In the first experiment, shrimp were
   fed with 0\%, 5\%, 33\%, and 61\% CHO and maintained at 15\% and 40\%
   salinity. Glucose, lactate protein, hemocyanin, ammonia concentration,
   and osmotic pressure were measured in blood. Digestive gland glycogen
   (DGG) was measured also. In the second experiment, shrimp were fed with
   0\% and 38\% dietary CHO and maintained at 15\% and 40\% salinity. From
   that shrimp, absorbed energy (Abs) was calculated as: Abs=respiration
   (R)+ammonia excretion (U) and production (P); assimilated energy (As)
   was calculated as the product of R x P. Osmotic pressure, hemocyanin,
   protein, lactate, and blood ammonia increased with the reduction in
   dietary CHO. In contrast, an increase in blood glucose was observed with
   an increase in dietary CHO. Digestive gland glycogen (DGG) increased
   following a saturation curve with a DGG maximum at 33\% dietary CHO.
   Blood metabolites of fasting and feeding shrimp showed the same
   behavior. Energy balance results showed that shrimp maintained in low
   salinity and fed without CHO waste more energy in U production than for
   shrimp maintained in high salinity and fed with high CHO levels.
   Notwithstanding, the production efficiency was higher in shrimp fed
   without CHO than that observed in shrimp fed with high CHO independent
   of salinity. A scheme trying to integrate the relation between CHO and
   protein metabolism and the way in which both are modulated by salinity
   is presented. From published and present results, there are two factors
   that apparently control the use of high dietary CHO levels;
   alpha-amylase enzyme-dietary CHO level capacity and glycogen saturation
   in DG. Production of glucose is limited in shrimp because of saturation
   of alpha-amylase when shrimp are fed with diets above 33\% CHO. This is
   the first control point of starch metabolism. The digestive gland is
   saturated with glycogen in shrimp fed with dietary CHO levels >33\%.
   This is apparently the second control point of CHO metabolism that
   limits growth rate in such conditions. The high metabolic cost related
   to high CHO diets could explain why shrimp are well adapted to use
   protein as a source of energy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The micro-anatomy of the cephalon is described in the troglobic
   asellotan isopod Craseriella anops from the Nohoch Nah Chich anchialine
   cave system in southeast Mexico. The cephalon is entirely covered by
   cuticular scales bordered by marginal spines. The anterior end of the
   cephalon is bordered by a carina that is wider medially. The isopod is
   eyeless. The distal seventh portion of the cephalon is characterized by
   the presence of two sutures and six setae. A suture is found on each
   side of the distal margin of the cephalon. Each suture is bordered by
   microtrichs. Two simple setae with a sensory hair, articulated on the
   base by a socket, are found one on each side of each of the sutures. Two
   additional setae, similar in shape and size, occur medially on the
   cephalon. A terminal pore is absent on the sensory hairs of all setae.
   These setae are suggested to be mechanoreceptors that provide
   directional sensitivity and enhance the sensibility of turbulent motion,
   viscosity and changes of hydrostatic pressure.},

Abstract = {The community structure of a tropical pond located in Mexico City was
   described. Primary producers were diverse and abundant and macrophyte
   components provide a broad habitat diversity. Major biotic components in
   the water column were algae of the genera Microcystis, Scenedesmus and
   Chlamydomonas. Mats of Cyclotella were located in deeper, shaded areas
   associated with the bottom. Three species of emergent macrophytes
   characterize the large primary producers. The zooplankton was dominated
   by protozoa, which were more abundant than rotifers and Crustacea.
   Dominant invertebrate species of the pond bottom were insect larvae,
   gastropod mollusks, oligochaete annelids and nematodes. Vertebrates
   (fish, amphibians, reptiles) feed on this variety of biotic components.
   A flow diagram depicted the major biological interactions and suggested
   a complex trophic structure.},

   presence of 136 individuals of which 131 were members of 20 troops, the
   rest were 3 solitary adult males and 2 adult males travelling as a pair.
   Ecological density was estimated at 23 individualslkm(2). Mean troop
   size was 7.0 individuals and it ranged from 2 - 12 individuals; 60\% of
   the troops were multimale. All sighting of howler monkeys were in
   evergreen rain forest and 75\% were in trees greater than or equal to20
   m in height. The reported densities and mean troop size are higher than
   those reported for the species in Guatemala and in central Quintana Roo,
   Mexico. The vegetation of the forest contains tree species reported to
   be used by species of Alouatta in the Moraceae, Sapotaceae, Leguminosae,
   and Lauraceae plant families. Protection of a large perimeter area (ca
   1700 ha) around the archeological site by the Mexican government ensures
   the conservation of the forest and of the black howler monkey population
   present at the site.},

Abstract = {A computer controlled high-gain amplifier has been designed for
   sensitive detection of optical signals. Based on the use of
   digital-to-analog converters DACs, the gain and offset of a
   transimpedance amplifier are adjusted through a computer trying to match
   ideal amplifier parameters for optical detection with different
   experimental conditions. The amplifying modules have been developed for
   optical-rheometry techniques that provide information about the
   microstructural properties of fluids by measuring optical anisotropies
   induced by transient flows. Characterization of these programmable gain
   amplifiers shows that they provide gains and bandwidths more than
   adequate for experiments involving signals that evolve rapidly and with
   a large dynamic range. Hence, the use of DACs allows for the possibility
   of computer controlling both gain and offset in real time, with a
   significant reduction of the spurious contributions from the amplifying
   stages during data acquisition. In spite of being designed for optical
   rheometry, the amplifiers could be useful for any other laboratory
   arrangements requiring an amplifying stage with real-time gain and
   offset adjustment capabilities. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {In order to improve seed germination and establishment of wild trees for
   restoration and reforestation, the effects of priming on seeds from two
   populations of Buddleja cordata were studied. Seeds were hydroprimed or
   osmoprimed with polyethylene glycol (-0.3 MPa) in a 12 h daily
   photoperiod at 12degreesC for 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 days. Priming
   treatments reduced germination percentages of seeds incubated in light
   at 25degreesC and decreased mean germination time. Rates and synchrony
   of germination were highest in hydroprimed seeds from Ajusco and in
   osmoprimed seeds from Pedregal, Primed seeds from the least
   water-stressed site (Ajusco) germinated to higher percentages than those
   from the most water-stressed site (Pedregal). Further, osmoprimed seeds
   from both populations germinated to higher percentages than hydroprimed
   seeds, Increased synchrony and germination rate were retained in
   osmoprimed seeds (hydropriming not tested) from both populations when
   stored dry. Germination percentages of primed seeds decreased and
   increased during storage, but after 78 wk they were not significantly
   different from those of recently collected seeds. Nonprimed seeds from
   Ajusco also showed fluctuation in dormancy, but nonprimed seeds from
   Pedregal had reduced germination through time, The significance of using
   primed seeds of B. cordata for restoring disturbed lands is discussed.},

Title = {Biogeographical analysis of the tree flora of the Yucatan Peninsula},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2002},

Abstract = {Aim The purpose of this study was to examine the biogeographical
   relationships of the tree flora of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP2). To this
   aim we: (1) evaluated the affinities of political entities of tropical
   America with the Yucatan Peninsula, considering the distribution of tree
   species occurring in the latter region; (2) assessed floristic
   affinities between political entities of the Yucatan Peninsula based on
   endemic species; (3) defined biogeographical districts for the Mexican
   portion of the Yucatan Peninsula; and (4) evaluated the conservation
   status of endemic species in the area.
   Location The Yucatan Peninsula is a biogeographical area comprising the
   entire territory of the Mexican states Campeche, Quintana Roo, and
   Yucatan, adjacent small portions of Tabasco and Chiapas, the El Peten
   department in Guatemala, and the northern half of Belize. Because of
   heterogeneous data availability some analyses were restricted to the
   first three above listed Mexican states (YP1), which comprise the core
   of the Yucatan Peninsula.
   Methods Distributional data of 434 tree species were obtained from three
   sources: inspection of 7640 herbarium specimens, specialist advice
   regarding the taxonomic status of the tree species, and an extensive
   review of taxonomic and floristic literature. We based the various
   analyses of phytogeographical affinities on Jaccard's Index. Information
   on individual species distributions was subjected to a multivariate
   analysis. Occurrence of endemic species in five existing protected areas
   in the Yucatan Peninsula was analysed by examining floristic checklists
   available for them.
   Results Affinities of the tree flora of YP1 with twenty-four political
   entities of tropical America generally decreased as geographical
   distances from this region increased. Distributional patterns of the
   seventy-two tree species endemic to YP2 showed the strongest affinities
   to exist between Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan, and in turn these
   entities displayed a large similarity with Belize and Guatemala.
   Regionalization of YP1, based on the distributions of both all species
   and the endemic ones, led to the distinction of two districts: a smaller
   one in the north-western corner, and a larger one comprising the
   remaining areas. Although the distributions of numerous species in the
   two groups matched the limits of these districts, ubiquitous species of
   panpeninsular distribution also occurred. For YP1 we identified nineteen
   endemic trees, indicating a percent endemism of 4.4 for this area. Of
   the sixty-four species endemic to YP2 which occur in YP1, fifty-two
   (81.2 \%) have been recorded in at least one of the five protected areas
   of this territory (three occurred in the five preserves and nineteen did
   so in a single one), whereas twelve (18.8 \%) were not found in any
   protected area.
   Main conclusions The definition of the Yucatan Peninsula as a
   biogeographical province was confirmed. The strongest floristic
   affinities of YP1 were with Mesoamerican entities, whereas affinities
   with the Antilles were much weaker. The distinction of two
   biogeographical districts corresponds closely to the peninsula's
   climatic and vegetational zonation. This regionalization agrees
   partially with schemes proposed for other animal and plant groups.
   Further inventory work in protected areas is needed to adequately assess
   the conservation status of the Yucatan Peninsula's tree endemics.},

Abstract = {This work deals with the study of the steady-state analysis of
   conjugated heat transfer process for the thermal entrance region of a
   developed laminar-forced convection flow of a power-law fluid in a
   circular tube. A known uniform heat flux is applied at the external
   surface of the tube. The energy equation in the fluid is solved
   analytically using the integral boundary layer approximation by
   neglecting the heat generation by viscous dissipation and the axial heat
   conduction in the fluid. This solution is coupled to the Laplace
   equation for the solid, where the axial heat conduction effects are
   taken into account. The governing equations are reduced to an
   integro-differential equation which is solved by analytical and
   numerical methods. The results are shown for different parameters such
   as conduction parameter, alpha, the aspect ratio of the tube, epsilon
   and the index of power-law fluid, n. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Pages = {223-227},
Abstract = {A powerful non-perturbative technique, which allows a direct evaluation
   of the ground state properties of an interacting electron gas in three
   dimensions, has been developed. In a unified approach, the low-,
   intermediate-, and high-density regions are considered. This technique
   is applied to three-dimensional (3D) systems with periodic electron
   density along one and two directions. The electronic and magnetic states
   of these systems are theoretically studied on the basis of the
   deformable jellium model, within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock
   approach. To determine the magnetic character of the 3D electron gas
   ground state, the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic energies are calculated
   and compared at low, intermediate, and high densities. As r(s)
   increases, several symmetry and/or magnetic transitions occur, in each
   system. The electronic and magnetic states obtained are compared with
   other theoretical results reported in the literature with different
   models;. In addition to planar and linear periodic electron densities,
   cubic electron densities are considered in order to look. for symmetry
   transitions among these systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   structures, was studied using high resolution cytochemical methods and
   in situ hybridization, in guinea pig and rat testis. Serial sectioning
   demonstrates that frequently the formation of the synaptonemal complex
   (SC) occurs without a previous development of isolated chromosomal axes.
   The lateral elements of the forming SC are in continuity with pairs of
   DNA-containing thin filaments. These chromatin filaments fold in
   numerous short loops just before incorporating to the lateral elements.
   Some of these loops are included in the ribbon-like structure of the
   lateral elements of the mature SC. We propose that these short loops
   contain the DNA attachment sequences associated with the proteins of the
   LE. During the formation of the SC one of the two chromatin filaments
   incorporates at the central surface of the forming lateral element (LE)
   and the other is located at the external side of the LE. This unexpected
   distribution does not correspond to the pair of thick filaments
   previously discerned in structure of the LE. The presence of RNA
   associated with the DNA-containing thin filaments, as well as with the
   axial chromatin elements of the forming SC, may be related with the
   transcription occurring during meiotic prophase, specially during
   zygotene stage. We propose that RNA is involved in a still
   uncharacterized process essential for pairing.},

Abstract = {The results of the study of the Collembola living in the epiphytic
   Tillandsia violacea at the National Park ``El Chico{''}, Central Mexico,
   during the rainy season of 1998 are presented. A total of 120 epiphytic
   plants were collected from Abies religiosa and Quercus spp. at two
   different elevations and processed in Berlese-Tullgren funnels for 15
   days. The Collembola were isolated, quantified and mounted in Hoyer's
   solution. 22,421 Collembola of 23 species were obtained which
   represented 50\% of all arthropods found. Sminthurinus guadrimaculatus
   was the most abundant representing 64\% of all the Collembola; followed
   by Schottella distincta (17\%) and Sphaeridia gr. brevipila (8\%). The
   multiple analysis of variance shows that altitude does not have a
   significant effect on Collembola abundance (F=2.41; df= 1,103; p>0.05),
   but it clearly does on the community composition. Supporting tree and
   plant size have a significant effect on Collembola abundance. There was
   a positive correlation between the physical and chemical parameters (pH,
   conductivity, sodium, potassium, calcium and dissolved C) of the water
   and soil from Tillandsia violacea with the abundance of the Collembola.},

Abstract = {A protocol for somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration of Ilex
   paraguariensis St. Hil. from embryos cultures was developed. Heart stage
   zygotic embryos were removed from seeds of immature, light green fruit
   and treated with antimicrotubule agents (0.1; 0.2. and 0.5\% colchicine

   alphaalphaalpha- trifluoro- 2,6-dinitro-N,N- dipropyl-p-toluidine, or
   oryzalin, 3,5-dinitro-N-4, N-dipropylsulphate during 48 h). The embryos
   were cultured aseptically on quarter-strength Murashige and Skoog medium
   containing 3\% sucrose, 0.65\% agar (1/4MS). and 0.46 muM zeatin.
   Cultures were incubated in darkness at 27 +/- 2 degreesC. All the
   treatments provoked a diminution of the number of germinated embryos and
   in some of the treated embryos somatic embryogenesis was induced.
   Somatic embryo maturation and conversion into whole plants could be
   achieved by culturing the embryos on 1/4MS lacking hormones and
   incubated at 27 +/- 2 degreesC, 14 h photoperiod (116 mumol m(-2)s(-1)).
   Most of the plants regenerated from somatic embryos appeared
   morphologically normal and grew under greenhouse conditions. Only 2
   plants out of 152 studied contained the tetraploid number of the
   chromosomes (2n = 4x = 80), meanwhile the rest of the plants had the
   normal diploid number of chromosomes (2n = 2x = 40). Somatic embryos
   with abnormal morphology were also observed.},

Title = {Oxygen consumption of the crab Callinectes rathbunae parasitized
   by the rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus as a function
   of salinity},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {235},
Pages = {189-194},
Abstract = {Rhizocephalan parasitism is one of the most important biotic factors
   affecting commercially valuable crab species in families such as
   Portunidae and Lithodidae. In addition to the long term and permanent
   effects of this parasitism on the hosts (e.g. sterilization, cessation
   of growth), other functional problems may arise due to the considerable
   size of the parasite and to its particular position inside and outside
   of the host. In this study, experiments with the Mexican blue crab
   Callinectes rathbunae parasitized by the rhizocephalan barnacle
   Loxothylacus texanus were conducted in the laboratory to test whether
   the parasite affects the host's oxygen consumption rate under changing
   salinity conditions, A total of 83 crabs (49 parasitized and 34
   controls), all initially acclimated to a salinity of 5, were used for
   metabolic rate measurements over sequential 24 h periods at salinities
   of 5, 15 and 25, During this 3 d period, oxygen consumption of
   individual crabs was measured 5 times per day. Parasitized crabs were
   classified, according to the degree of maturation of the parasite, as:
   (1) crabs with internal parasites, bearing a modified abdomen; (2) crabs
   with virgin, immature, recently emerged parasites; and (3) crabs with
   mature, fully developed parasites. Crabs with internal and virgin
   parasites did not show differences in oxygen consumption rates with
   respect to control crabs, Crabs with mature parasites consumed from 57
   to 139\% more than other crabs under all salinity conditions, Although
   there is a significant metabolic cost for the host associated to the
   presence of mature L texanus, it is not clear what specific process is
   responsible for the observed results. Since the increased oxygen
   consumption was unrelated to salinity, it is concluded that the host's
   osmoregulatory capabilities are not affected; other possible
   explanations include the constant grooming and maintenance of the
   parasite, At the population level, our results suggest that hosts
   bearing mature parasites may move within the estuaries from low to high
   salinity areas in order to reduce the metabolic energy expenditure
   caused by the combination of the parasite and hypoosmotic conditions.},

Abstract = {The reduction of reproductive performance of adult males of Litopenaeus
   setiferus in captivity has been limiting the massive nauplii production,
   mainly by lowering the spermatophore attachment success associated with
   the male reproductive tract degenerative and the male reproductive
   melanization syndromes. Both syndromes had been related to the captivity
   and management stress. In this study the bioenergetic alterations were
   measured after seven days in captivity through absorption efficiency
   (AE), absorption (A), routine respiratory rate (R(ROUT)), apparent heat
   increment (R(AH1)), ammonia excretion (U) and post-prandial nitrogen
   excretion (PPNE), as indexes of captivity stress in adult males of L.
   setiferus kept at 27 and 31 degreesC. All this parameters were
   integrated through the production equation (P(t)) =A - (R(AH1) + R(ROUT)
   + U) At 31 degreesC the equation values were higher than those observed
   at 27 degreesC, except for R(ROUT) and ammonia excretion. The amount of
   energy directed to P(T) at 31 degreesC was 1784.99 j g(-1) afdwd(-1), in
   contrast with shrimp exposed at 27 degreesC, where it was 1269.22 J
   g(-1) afdw d(-1) (P > 0.05). The O:N ratio obtained was lower than 10,
   indicating the use of a proteic substrate (P > 0.05). The reduction of
   the metabolic responses at high temperature shows what the adaptation
   capability of this shrimp is to tolerate a wide range of temperatures,
   also reflecting the adaptation mechanisms associated with its
   distribution in shallow coastal waters.},

Abstract = {The reservoirs studied are located on a very important migratory flyway
   in the Mexican Central Plateau. The survey included the waterfowl,
   macrophytes and physico-chemical parameters of three localities visited
   on ten occasions during a 1-year period. A total of 23 waterfowl species
   were observed: 6 transients, 10 winter visitants, and 7 residents. A
   period of increased richness was detected in winter, when migratory
   species arrive at the reservoirs. A canonical correspondence analysis
   showed segregation patterns of the species for the use of the space.
   Migratory ducks occurred in Umecuaro, where there is a larger variety of
   macrophytes and eutrophication occurs. Loma Caliente was the area with
   less eutrophication and was not preferred by ducks. Gallinago gallinago
   and Ardea herodias were the species with the highest frequency of
   occurrence, while the Effluent was the preferred site of resident
   species. Although the reservoirs studied are small, they are suitable
   for a significative number of species to be considered as a waterfowl

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study of transient ignition and combustion of
   hydrogen/air mixtures by a heated, thin catalytic wire in a natural
   convection environment. Modeling of the process is accomplished via a
   reduced set of heterogeneous kinetic processes which include
   dissociative adsorption and desorption of both reactants, three fast
   surface reactions of the Langmiur-Hinshelwood type, and the desorption
   reaction of the adsorbed product, H2O(S). The overall surface reaction
   rate is found to be limited by the adsorption rate of molecular oxygen,
   which depends on the concentration of molecular oxygen close to the
   surface of the wire and the distribution of empty sites in the catalyst.
   The analysis allows the determination of the critical conditions for
   ignition and the ignition delay time as a function of the important
   physicochemical parameters. The resulting wire temperatures and the
   critical value of the external heating rate at ignition are computed.
   The analysis shows how the ignition temperature increases as the
   external heating rate increases. The configuration dependence of the
   ignition temperature is taken as an indication that the use of a
   critical Damkohler number provides a better ignition condition than the
   ignition temperature concept. A self-sustained combustion regime for
   strong diluted mixtures is described.},

   Landauer equation for neutrons and photons diffusing in a slab of

   diffusion coefficient. The 3D transmission coefficient obtained is
   smaller than the 1D case. The P-1 result, valid only for thick slabs, is
   proved to be an excellent approximation to the exact solution. (C) 2001

Abstract = {The hypoglycemic effects of water and butanolic extracts prepared from

   was used as reference and showed similar hypoglycemic effect to the

Title = {Effect of dietary carbohydrates on gluconeogenesis in premolt

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Because in the premolt stage L. stylirostris should produce glycogen to
   prepare chitin synthesis, the present paper was directed to answer the
   following questions: (a) Could an absence of dietary carbohydrates (CHO)
   enhance the gluconeogenesis pathway in premolt shrimp, following the
   trend in species of carnivorous fish? (b) In premoulting shrimp is it
   necessary to force the glyconeogenic pathway through intensive feeding
   or is a two meal/day feeding schedule enough? (c) Is the CHO metabolism
   adaptation affected by the age of shrimp? and (d) are the same
   mechanisms working in moult stage C and D?. A comparison with shrimp fed
   the same diets and in stage C has been done to determine the effect of
   the molt stage and dietary CHO levels in glycogen accumulation of this
   shrimp species. Results obtained showed that in stage D shrimp the
   gluconeogenlic pathway was enhanced, both in an intensive or in a two
   meal/day feeding schedule, independently of the age of the shrimp. The
   accumulation of glycogen to support both chitin synthesis and metabolic
   glucose is proposed as an explanation. Comparing the results obtained in
   the present paper with that of L. stylirostris juveniles published
   earlier, it is possible to observe that both in 12 hour fasting and
   during glycemia, the glycogen concentration in stage C shrimp was
   opposite of that observed in stage D shrimp. These results show that the
   intensity of the gluconeogenesis pathway changes with the molting stage,
   being of more importance in the premolt stage (D) than during the
   intermoult stage (C).},

Abstract = {Using the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation, Cooper pairing can be
   generalized to include contributions from holes as well as particles
   from the ground state of either an ideal Fermi gas (IFG) or of a BCS
   many-fermion state. The BCS model interfermion interaction is employed
   throughout. In contrast to the better-known original Cooper pair (CP)
   problem for either two particles or two holes, the generalized Cooper
   equation in the IFG case has no real-energy solutions. Rather, it
   possesses two complex-conjugate solutions with purely imaginary
   energies. This implies that the IFG ground state is unstable when an
   attractive interaction is switched on. However, solving the BS equation
   for the BCS ground state reveals two types of real solutions: one
   describing moving (i.e., having nonzero total, or center-of-mass.,
   momenta) CPs as resonances (or bound composite particles with a finite
   lifetime). and another exhibiting superconducting collective excitations
   analogous to Anderson-Bogoliubov-Higgs RPA modes. A
   Bose-Einstein-condensation-based picture of superconductivity is

Abstract = {Objective. To compare the severity of rotavirus diarrhea (RV) and
   non-rotavirus diarrhea. Material and Methods. Between October 1994 and
   March 1995, a cross-sectional study was performed in 520 infants with
   acute diarrhea, at seven primary care level centers in five states of
   Mexico. Diagnosis of RV was done through immunoenzymatic assay or
   electrophoresis. Central tendency measures were used for data analysis,
   Results were presented as means and standard deviations, or median and
   variation. Results. RV was isolated from 264 children; most of them were
   males aged 6 months to 1 year. Differences in clinical manifestations
   were statistically significant between the rotavirus-positive group and
   the rotavirus-negative group, in the following variables: median number
   of stools/24 hours; frequency of vomiting; temperature > 38degreesC;
   dehydration; and clinical severity scoring, Conclusions. These results
   showed a poorer prognosis and a higher severity of rotavirus diarrhea,
   as compared to non-rotavirus diarrhea in infants. The English version of

Abstract = {The present study was undertaken to establish the effect of salinity and
   acclimation time on the oxygen consumption of juvenile white shrimp
   Litopenaeus vannamei through evaluation of the mechanisms involved in
   adjustments of respiratory metabolism during acclimation and the effects
   on the apparent heat increment (AHI). Four experiments were conducted to
   assess the effect of acclimation time on oxygen consumption of shrimp
   exposed to salinity changes between 30 parts per thousand to 5 parts per
   thousand. The effects of a change of salinity were recorded immediately
   in the first hour and 24 h after change. The results showed that L.
   vannamei juveniles are well adapted to tolerate salinity changes when
   they are subjected to sudden change in salinity or are acclimated to
   salinity change. The effect of salinity on the apparent heat-increment
   coefficient (AHI-\%) in shrimp acclimated over time was also tested. The
   fasting and feeding oxygen consumptions were increased according to a
   reduction in salinity, with high values in 5 parts per thousand and
   lower values in 30 parts per thousand. Although at 15 parts per thousand
   salinity the animals require energy to maintain homeostasis, we believe
   the juveniles acclimated at that salinity could be more efficient than
   those acclimated at 5 parts per thousand or 30 parts per thousand
   salinity because in that salinity shrimp consumed 1.22 and 1.69 more
   food than that observed in shrimp acclimated at 30 parts per thousand
   and 5 parts per thousand, respectively, and without an excessive
   increase in the costs associated with AHI-\%.},

Abstract = {In this paper we prove that for every cardinal kappa, the space C-p(D-k)
   admits a continuous bijection onto a space whose all finite powers are
   Lindelof (the symbol D stands for the discrete two-point space). We also
   prove that for every metrizable compact space X, the space Cp (X) can be
   condensed (i.e., admits a continuous bijection) onto the Hilbert cube
   I-omega. As a consequence it is established that the space Cp (DI) can
   be condensed onto a compact space. In connection to this result, we also
   prove that there exist models of ZFC in which the statement ``The spaces
   C-p(D-k) can be condensed onto a compact space for every cardinal kappa
   > omega{''} is not true. We show also that for every cardinal K, the
   spaces C-p(C-p(D-k)) and L-p(D-k) have dense subsets of countable
   tightness. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and usually progressive lung
   disorder of unknown etiology. A growing body of evidence suggests that,
   in contrast to other interstitial lung diseases, IPF is a distinct
   entity in which inflammation is a secondary and non-relevant pathogenic
   partner. Evidence includes the presence of similar mild/moderate
   inflammation either in early or late disease, and the lack of response
   to potent anti-inflammatory therapy. Additionally, it is clear from
   experimental models and some human diseases that it is possible to have
   fibrosis without inflammation. An evolving hypothesis proposes that IPF
   may result from epithelial micro-injuries and abnormal wound healing.},

Abstract = {Ring-shaped bodies are found in the nucleus of Lacandonia schismatica, a
   rare plant with the sexual organs inverted. They are 0.5-mum-diameter
   structures that present an electron-dense external ring surrounding a
   central core. Ultrastructural studies indicate that these bodies contain
   RNA. The external ring is labeled with antibodies against small nuclear
   ribonucleoproteins, suggesting that they may be involved in pre-mRNA
   metabolism. In the present work we further characterized these
   intranuclear ring-shaped structures by serial-sectioning analysis.
   Moreover, we tested the presence of additional molecular elements
   related to pre-mRNA metabolism, such as SR proteins and poly(A)(+) RNA,
   using immunoelectron microscopy and ultrastructural in situ
   hybridization. Our results show that these nuclear bodies are spherical.
   They contain SR proteins involved in splicing and postsplicing events
   and little to no poly(A)(+) RNA. We also found similar nuclear bodies in
   other plant and animal species. Therefore, ring-shaped bodies in L.
   schismatica are spherical, highly compartmentalized nuclear structures
   that may be involved in pre-mRNA metabolism. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A new population of blind, cave dwelling tetra fish of the genus
   Astyanax was discovered in Granadas Cave, in the Balsas drainage,
   southern Mexico. All blind Mexican tetras previously described are from
   Tampico and San Luis Potosi, northern Mexico. The discovery of a new
   blind morph thus represents an independent colonization and convergent
   adaptation to the cave environment by this fish. Individuals of this
   population display variability of their troglomorphic features. Some
   individuals presented asymmetrical degeneration of the eyes, where one
   was normal, but the other somewhat reduced in size and complexity. Loss
   of pigmentation and eye reduction, although sometimes correlated, were
   not always linked; reduced eyes were found on pigmented fish and
   unpigmented fish often possessed normal eyes. Some individuals had
   reduced lens size or an absence of lens altogether. Retina is highly
   modified with photoreceptors sometimes absent. Eye reduction was
   correlated with a diminished size of the optic lobes and an increase of
   the prosencephalon. Modifications of the skull involve closing in of the
   circumorbital series of bones. Certain aspects of behavior are also
   modified.},

Abstract = {Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a lung inflammatory disorder
   characterized by accumulation of T lymphocytes. However, the mechanisms
   implicated in this process remain undefined. We examined the expression
   of dendritic cell (DC)derived CC chemokine I (CK1)/CCL18, a chemokine
   putatively involved in naive T cell recruitment, in lungs from 10
   patients with HP, 9 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),
   and 20 healthy lungs. CCL18 was measured by real-time quantitative PCR
   and localized in lungs by in situ hybridization and
   immunohistochemistry. CCL18 expression was significantly increased in
   lungs affected by HP in comparison with lungs affected by IPF (2,085 +/-
   393 vs. 1,023 +/- 110; P <0.05) and controls (2,085 +/- 393 vs. 467 +/-
   94; P <0.01). Macrophages, DCs, and alveolar epithelial cells were the
   main sources of CCL18. There was a direct correlation between the levels
   of tissue CCL18 and the number of lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluids. High levels of CCL18 were detected in the subacute rather
   than the chronic phase of HP. These findings suggest a role for CCL18 in
   the pathogenesis of HP.},

Abstract = {We study the possibility for the existence of Jahn-Teller distortions in
   the La-(Ba,Sr)-Cu-O system. The Jahn-Teller analysis is based on the
   calculation and correspondingly group theory classification for the
   electron spectra of the CuO6 elongated octahedra cluster, having the
   symmetry group D-4h. The motivation to study this model is that the
   origin of the apical deformation is not a pure Jahn-Teller effect,
   having therefore a non a priori condition to remove all the degeneracy
   of the ground state electronic wave function of the regular octahedron
   with O-h symmetry. This is based on an ab initio calculation of the
   electronic ground state of the cluster representing the above mentioned
   system, using an open shell restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock
   (RHF-OS,UHF) wave functions for several basis sets. The system is formed
   with a total of 87 electrons, with 44 and 43 occupied alpha and beta
   orbitals respectively for the UHF calculation. We present a comparative
   analysis of the symmetry classified electron spectra for each of the
   above mentioned calculations including polarized states. It is shown
   that in all cases the HOMO states for partially filled levels are not
   degenerate given therefore a nondegenerate total electronic ground state
   wave function. Based on this analysis we do not find, within the cluster
   approximation and the use of HF wave functions, the necessary condition
   for the fulfillment of the Jahn-Teller theorem.},

Abstract = {We present a numerical simulation carried out in order to explain the
   complex morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 400.2. Numerical
   simulations were done employing the new yguazu-a code (Raga et al.
   2000). In the radio continuum, this remnant seems to be formed by two
   shells, which are partially overlapping (Dubner et al. 1994). Taking
   into account observational evidence such as a previous HI study (Giacani
   et al. 1998), we find that an adequate model for describing the
   morphology of the SNR 3C 400.2 is obtained by assuming that a single
   supernova (SN) explosion took place in a dense medium and close to an
   interface separating this medium from a lower density region. Besides,

Abstract = {It is known that the poblano green pepper, a significant component in
   the Mexican diet, contains certain natural compounds such as
   chlorophyll, beta -carotene, and vitamins, which have antimutagenic
   and/or anticarcinogenic properties. Using the somatic mutation and
   recombination test in wing cells of Drosophila melanogaster, an extract
   of the poblano pepper (Capsicum spp.) was evaluated to determine its
   antimutagenic effect against the nitrosation process, simulating the
   process occurring in the human stomach caused by known food additives.
   Larvae of 72 h old D. melanogaster of standard (ST) and high
   bioactivation (HB]) crosses were exposed in a simultaneous, chronic
   treatment with the juice expressed from the crushed, whole, fresh pepper
   fruit, plus the mixture of 20 mM methyl urea (MU) and sodium nitrite
   (SN), mixed with the animals' food. Three doses of pepper juice (12.5,
   25, and 50\%) were used. The background mutation rate given as spots per
   wing was 0.36 and 0.48 for ST and HB, respectively. Mutation frequencies
   produced by the MU and SN mixture was 1.73 (ST) and 26.46 (HB) mutations
   per wing. The poblano juice decreased the above rates between 40 and
   80\%, respectively. The experiments suggest that some compounds present
   in the green pepper may cause this antimutagenic effect by interfering
   with the nitrosation process. The role of the extract and one of its
   components, such as vitamin C, in the nitrosation process will be
   discussed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the rhythmic changes in glutathione
   status in midgut gland and hemolymph as well as in glutathione reductase
   (GR) activity in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. In order to determine
   the circadian nature of these rhythms different groups of crayfish were
   submitted to constant-darkness conditions for 24 or 72 It after they had
   spent 15 days under light-dark 12:12 cycles. The animals of the
   different batches were killed at 6 h intervals during a 24 h cycle.
   Reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in hemolymph
   and midgut as well as midgut GR activity were determined in midgut gland
   and hemolymph by fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Data
   analysis by chronogram and single Cosinor revealed circadian rhythmicity
   for GSH and GSSG concentration in both tissues as well as midgut GR
   activity. The rhythm parameters revealed oxidative stress induced by
   light. The possible correlation between the glutathione rhythm and other
   metabolic and behavioral rhythms of crayfish as well as the importance
   of the glutathione circadian temporal order in the adaptation of
   crayfish are discussed.},

Abstract = {We study a reaction diffusion model recently proposed in {[}5] to
   describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis
   on agar plates containing nutrient. An interesting mathematical feature
   of the model, which is a coupled pair of partial differential equations,
   is that the bacterial density satisfies a degenerate nonlinear diffusion
   equation. It was shown numerically that this model can exhibit
   quasi-one-dimensional constant speed travelling wave solutions. We
   present an analytic study of the existence and uniqueness problem for
   constant speed travelling wave solutions. We find that such solutions
   exist only for speeds greater than some threshold speed giving minimum
   speed waves which have a sharp profile. For speeds greater than this
   minimum speed the waves are smooth. We also characterise the dependence
   of the wave profile on the decay of the front of the initial
   perturbation in bacterial density. An investigation of the partial
   differential equation problem establishes, via a global existence and
   uniqueness argument, that these waves are the only long time solutions
   supported by the problem. Numerical solutions of the partial
   differential equation problem are presented and they confirm the results
   of the analysis.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report a family where the affected DMD patients were
   riot available for study and a molecular strategy was used for female
   carriers detection and for prenatal diagnosis. Linkage analysis was
   performed with two markers within the DMD gene, in all family members
   screened. DMD markers used (pERT87.8/Taq1 and pERT87.15/Xmn1) seemed not
   to be informative because the proposita's mother (II-2) was homozygous
   for the minor allele at each marker (T2 and X2), however, the proposita
   and one sister carried only the major allele, which was inherited from
   the father. These results suggested that a deletion involving both
   markers could be presents and was inherited from the mother to both
   daughters. Quantitative multiplex PCR confirmed the deletion in female
   carriers, involving at least exons 12 to 17. DNA studies of cultured
   amniotic fluid cells at 14 weeks gestation, by amplification of specific
   Y-chromosome sequences, followed by multiplex PCR, lead to the diagnosis
   of a male fetus affected by DMD. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et

Abstract = {Integrate and fire processes are fundamental mechanisms causing
   excitable and oscillatory behavior. Van der Pol {[}Philos. Mag. (7) 2
   (11) (1926) 978] studied oscillations caused by these processes, which
   he called,relaxation oscillations' and pointed out their relevance, not
   only to engineering, but also to the understanding of biological
   phenomena {[}Acta Med. Scand. Suppl. CVIII (108) (1940) 76], like
   cardiac rhythms and arrhythmias. The complex behavior of externally
   stimulated integrate and fire oscillators has motivated the study of
   simplified models whose dynamics are determined by iterations of `firing
   circle maps' that can be studied in terms of Poincare's rotation theory
   {[}Chaos 1 (1991) 20; Chaos 1 (1991) 13; SIAM J. Appl. Math. 41 (3)
   (1981) 503]. In order to apply this theory to understand the responses
   and bifurcation patterns of forced systems, it is fundamental to
   determine the regions in parameter space where the different regularity
   properties (e.g., continuity and injectivity) of the firing maps are
   satisfied. Methods for carrying out this regularity analysis for linear
   systems, have been devised and the response of integrate and fire
   neurons (with linear accumulation) to a cyclic input has been analyzed
   {[}SIAM J. Appl. Math. 41 (3) (1981) 503]. In this paper we are
   concerned with the most general class of forced integrate and fire
   systems, modelled by one first-order differential equation. Using
   qualitative analysis we prove theorems on which we base a new method of
   regularity analysis of the firing map, that, contrasting with methods
   previously reported in the literature, does not requires analytic
   knowledge of the solutions of the differential equation and therefore it
   is also applicable to non-linear integrate and fire systems. To
   illustrate this new methodology, we apply it to determine the regularity
   regions of a non-linear example whose firing maps undergo bifurcations
   that were unknown for the previously studied linear systems. (C) 2001

Abstract = {The influence of protein and energy levels on growth rate, survival.
   pre- and post-prandial oxygen consumption. ammonia excretion, haemolymph
   glucose (HG), glycogen in digestive gland and osmotic pressure (OP) in
   white shrimp Litopenaeus vannnmei (Boone) and L. setiferus (Linne)
   juveniles was studied. Diets containing a high-quality protein at a
   protein/energy (P/E) ratio of 16, 26, 31 and 36 mg kJ(-1) were fed at
   20\% of shrimp body weight of two sizes: < 1 g and > 1 g. Both species
   showed a optimum P/E ratio of 36 mg kJ(-1) (33-44\% protein and 6-23\%
   carbohydrate) in juveniles <1g. For shrimp >1g, L. setiferus showed a
   higher growth rate in the diet with 16 mg kJ(-1) (27\% protein: 32\%
   carbohydrate) and L. vannamei between 26 and 36 mg kJ(-1) (33-44\%
   protein and 6-23\% carbohydrate). In both experiments, the growth rate
   of L. vannamei was 2-3 times that observed in L. setiferus. Routine
   oxygen consumption and apparent heat increment (AHI) of L. setiferus
   juveniles was two times higher than that observed in L. vannamei
   juveniles, which could indicate that L, setiferus has a higher metabolic
   rate. The O/N ratio varied according to protein level, with higher
   values (O/N = 180) with a 16-mg kJ(-1) diet and lower values (O/N = 73)
   with a 36-mg kJ(-1) diet in L. setiferus juveniles. A similar variation
   in O/N ratio was obtained in L. vannnmei fed with all diets with an
   interval between 22 and 50. An inverse relation between ammonia
   excretion and HG, and digestive gland glycogen (DGG) in relation to an
   increase in the P/E ratio indicate that both shrimp species are well
   adapted to use carbohydrates and/or proteins from their diet. The higher
   values of hyper-osmotic capacity (hyper-OC) were observed in L.
   setiferus <1g fed with 36 mg kJ(-1) and the lowest in L. vannamei <1 g
   fed with 31 mg kJ(-1). Intermediate values of hyper-OC were observed in
   both species fed all diets indicating that osmotic factors of juveniles
   <1g of both species are more affected by the P/E ratio than juveniles
   >1g. All results showed that juveniles > 1 g of both species are less
   dependent of P/E ratio than juveniles <1 g. Litopenaeus vannnmei is a
   most tolerant shrimp species with a high capacity to use a wide range of
   dietary P/E ratios for growth, which may be due to its lower energy
   requirements. Litopenaeus setiferus showed a lower capacity to accept
   different P/E ratios but the optimum P/E ratio obtained with this
   species shows that L. setiferus accept diets with a high carbohydrate
   level as well. These results demonstrate that there are nutritional and
   physiological differences that explain the differences that have been
   observed when both species were cultured in commercial ponds.},

Abstract = {Massive nauplii production in Litopenaeus setiferus by means of natural
   matings has not been reported. The main reason is the low spermatophore
   attachment rate that has been associated with male sterilization because
   of male reproductive tract degenerative and the male reproductive
   melanization syndromes (MRTDS and MRMS). This information indicated both
   syndromes could be related to the captivity and management stress that
   affects the immune system and the physiological state of shrimp. We used
   some blood metabolic variables, sperm quality, and immune response as
   indicators of captivity stress in adult males of L. setiferus. A
   comparison between freshly captured shrimp with shrimp maintained in the
   laboratory for 7 days at two temperatures were examined. Glucose and
   calcium were not different between fresh and acclimated shrimp at either
   temperature (P > 0.05). A reduction in triacylglycerol, proteins, and
   cholesterol was observed in acclimated shrimp in comparison with base
   line shrimp (P < 0.05). Lactate was reduced only in shrimp acclimated at
   the lower temperature. Sperm quality was not significantly different
   between base line samples and acclimated shrimp. The immune system was
   altered in acclimated shrimp at both temperatures. A reduction in total
   haemocytes, granular cells, and semigranullar cells was measured in
   acclimated shrimp in comparison with base-line shrimp. In contrast, a
   higher phenoloxidase activity (proPO) was observed in acclimated shrimp,
   indicating that regulatory mechanisms of immune system of those shrimp
   were altered by captivity conditions. The blood metabolic variables
   indicated that captive shrimp were affected nutritionally more than
   physiologically. The immune response showed the nutritional effect or
   another management factor reduced the cellular defenses and altered the
   molecular mechanisms associated with melanin production. This could be
   related to the melanization syndrome observed in previous studies. A new
   sequence to explain the appearance of the male reproductive shrimp
   syndromes of L. setiferus was proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

   that progesterone receptors were localized in the nuclei of germinal
   epithelium and germ cells of the ovarian cortex and in the interstitial
   and epithelial cells of the lacunar channels of the ovarian medulla.
   Undifferentiated cells did not present progesterone receptors. In all

   isoforms are differentially expressed in the chick pre-follicular ovary

Abstract = {The effect of dietary protein and energy content on the activity of
   digestive enzymes (total proteinases, trypsin, chymotrypsin alpha
   -amylase and lipase), and growth and survival of Litopenaeus setiferus
   postlarvae was investigated under controlled conditions. There was a
   clear relationship between the diet fed to the postlarvae, growth and
   survival. Highest weight gain (2110 +/- 96.7\%) was obtained with a 400
   g kg(-1) protein and low energy diet (13.9 kJ g(-1)) (P < 0.05). The
   optimal protein to energy ratio (P/E) estimated was 28.8 mg of protein
   kJ(-1). Good survival was obtained with low energy diets containing
   between 200 and 400 g kg(-1) protein and with high energy diets
   containing 300-500 g kg(-1) protein. Higher values for total
   proteinases, trypsin and <alpha>-amylase were obtained with the low
   energy, 400 g kg(-1) protein diet. Chymotryptic activity was
   considerably lower than that of other proteinases and lipase activity
   was too low to be reliably measured with the turbidimetric method
   employed. Total proteinase activity was significantly lower than in
   experimentally grown postlarvae. The alpha -amylase activity was at
   least two orders of magnitude higher in wild postlarvae than in animals
   fed with the best experimental diet. Protein requirement was related to
   total energy content of the diet: best growth and digestive enzyme
   activity coincide with the low energy, 400 g kg(-1) protein diet. These
   results suggest that dietary carbohydrates cannot spare protein because
   growth rates obtained with diets containing 200-300 g kg(-1) protein
   (337 and 226 g kg(-1) dextrin content, respectively) were significantly
   lowered.},

Abstract = {This present study was designed to investigate the effects of stocking
   density and water exchange on the growth rate, survival and performance
   index of L. setiferus postlarvae under controlled laboratory conditions.
   The experiment was done with postlarvae (PL10 to PL40) at densities of
   50, 150, 250 and 350 shrimp/m(2) and various different water exchanges
   rate per day (0, 6, 12 and 18\%). The maximum growth rate was obtained
   for shrimp with 12\% water exchange per day at all densities. A
   reduction of the maximum growth rate was observed in relation to density
   with the highest values in shrimp stocked in a density of 50 and 150
   shrimp/m(2) (mean value of 0.53 mg/d) and the lowest in shrimp stocked
   in a density of 350 shrimp/m(2) (0.24 mg/d), The multiple regression
   equation obtained to relate performance index (growth rate {*} survival
   : PI), shrimp density (X-1) and water exchange (X-2) was: PI = 0.31 +
   (0.001) X-1 + 0.039 X-2 + 2.28 x 10(-6) X-1(2) + (-0,0017) X-2(2) +
   (0.000026)X1X2,R-2 = 0.78; P < 0.03. According to this equation the
   optimum shrimp density-water exchange combination was between 5 to 12\%
   of water exchange at stocking density of between 50 and 150 shrimp/m2.
   Salinity, ammonia-N and nitrite-N increased according to the time spent
   in tanks without water exchange. With no (0\%) water exchange, water
   quality parameters measured were outside the optimum for L. setiferus
   postlarvae, The use of optimum density and water exchange in a nursery
   system for L. setiferus with optimum variables established is proposed.},

Abstract = {To take into account static correlation effects in the
   quasi-two-dimensional electron gas a screened Coulombic interaction
   between particles is studied. The Thomas-Fermi approximation is used and
   the potential screening appears as a function of the Wigner-Seitz
   density parameter r(s) and the effective width t of the system. With the
   self-consistent field theory applied to the modified deformable jellium,
   the ground-state energy per particle and the conditions for electron
   localization are obtained in terms of the interparticle distance and the
   screening parameter mu. A critical minimum characteristic width t(c) is
   obtained; below t(c) no long-range order is obtained. For larger widths
   a stable localized state is predicted at finite densities. (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {Aim Halffter's Mexican Transition Zone is a complex area in which the
   Neotropical and Nearctic regions overlap. We test its existence and
   extension through a track analysis of beetle taxa, and discuss the
   implications of geographical homology.
   Location The area analysed corresponds to the Caribbean subregion, which
   occupies Mexico, Central America, north-western South America, and the
   Western Indies.
   Methods The panbiogeographic or track analysis was based in the
   comparison of 134 individual tracks belonging to different beetle taxa
   (species and supraspecific groups). A Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity
   (PAE) was applied in order to classify the areas by their shared taxa
   according to the most parsimonious cladogram, and the nested sets of
   areas were represented as generalized tracks.
   Results Two generalized tracks resulted: (1) northern generalized track:
   comprising the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental,
   Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Balsas Basin and Sierra Madre del Sur
   biogeographic provinces; and (2) southern generalized track: comprising
   the Chiapas, Mexican Gulf, Mexican Pacific Coast and western Panamanian
   Isthmus biogeographic provinces.
   Main conclusions The generalized tracks obtained correspond broadly to
   Halffter's Nearctic and Mesoamerican patterns, respectively; however, in
   contrast to Halffter's Mesoamerican pattern, the southern generalized
   track extends further north through the lowlands of the Pacific and
   Mexican Gulf coasts.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder
   characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix
   accumulation. However, studies on fibroblast growth rate and collagen
   synthesis have given contradictory results. Here we analyzed fibroblast
   growth rate by a formazan-based chromogenic assay; fibroblast apoptosis
   by in situ end labeling (ISEL) and propidium iodide staining; percent of
   alpha -smooth muscle actin (alpha -SMA) positive cells by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorter; and alpha1-(I) collagen,
   transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, collagenase-1, gelatinases A and
   B, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1,-2,-3, and -4
   expression by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction in
   fibroblasts derived from IPF and control lungs. Growth rate was
   significantly lower in IPF fibroblasts compared with controls (13.3 +/-
   38.5\% versus 294.6 +/- 57\%, P < 0.0001 at 13 d). Conversely a
   significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in
   IPF-derived fibroblasts (ISEL: 31.9 <plus/minus> 7.0\% versus 15.5 +/-
   7.6\% from controls; P < 0.008). <alpha>-SMA analysis revealed a
   significantly higher percentage of myofibroblasts in IPF samples (62.8
   +/- 25.2\% versus 14.8 +/- 11.7\% from controls; P < 0.01). IPF
   fibroblasts were characterized by an increase in pro-<alpha>1-(I)
   collagen, TGF-beta1, gelatinase B, and all TIMPs' gene expression,
   whereas collagenase-1 and gelatinase A expression showed no differences.
   These results suggest that fibroblasts from IPF exhibit a profibrotic
   secretory phenotype, with lower growth rate and increased spontaneous
   apoptosis.},

Title = {Metabolism and growth of juveniles of Litopenaeus vannamei:
   effect of salinity and dietary carbohydrate levels},

Year = {2001},
Volume = {259},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The present study was designed to understand how carbohydrate (CBH) and
   protein metabolism are related in the penaeid shrimp Litopenaeus
   vannamei. With this information, we obtained a comprehensive schedule of
   the protein-carbohydrate metabolism including enzymatic, energetic, and
   functional aspects. We used salinity to determine its role as a
   modulator of the protein-carbohydrate metabolism in shrimp. Two
   experiments were designed. The first experiment evaluated the effect of
   CBH-salinity combinations in growth and survival, and hemolymph glucose,
   protein, and ammonia levels, digestive gland glycogen, osmotic pressure,
   and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of L. vannamei juveniles acclimated
   during 18 days at a salinity of 15 parts per thousand and 40 parts per
   thousand. The second experiment was done to evaluate the effect of
   dietary CBH level on pre- and postprandial oxygen consumption, ammonia
   excretion, and the oxygen-nitrogen ratio (O/N) of juvenile L. vannamei
   in shrimps acclimated at 40 parts per thousand salinity. We also
   evaluated the ability of shrimp to carbohydrate: adaptation. We made
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PECPK) and hexokinase activity
   measurements after a change in dietary carbohydrate levels at different
   times during 10 days. The growth rate depended on the combination
   salinity-dietary CBH-protein level. The maximum growth rate was obtained
   in shrimps maintained at 15 parts per thousand salinity and with a diet
   containing low CBH and high protein. The protein in hemolymph is related
   to the dietary protein levels; high dietary protein levels produced a
   high protein concentration in hemolymph. This suggests hemolymph is able
   to stoic proteins after a salinity acclimation. Depending on the
   salinity, the hemolymph proteins could be used as a source of osmotic
   effectors or as metabolic energy. The O/N values obtained show that
   shrimp used proteins as a source of energy mainly when shrimps were fed
   with low CBH. The role played by postprandial nitrogen excretion (PPNE)
   in apparent heat increase (AHI) (PPNE/AHI ratio) is lower in shrimps
   feti diets containing high CBH in comparison with shrimps fed diets
   containing low CBH levels. These results confirm that the metabolism of
   L. vannamei juveniles is controlled by dietary protein levels, affecting
   the processes involved in the mechanical and biochemical transformations
   of ingested food. A growth depression effect was observed in shrimps fed
   with low-CBH protein diets and maintained in 40 parts per thousand
   salinity. Ln these shrimps, the: hemolymph ammonia concentration (HAC)
   was significantly higher than that observed in shrimps fed with low CBH
   and maintained in 15 parts per thousand salinity, That high HAC level
   coincided with lower growth rate, which suggests that this level might
   be toxic for juveniles of L. vannamei. Results obtained for GDH activity
   showed this enzyme regulated both HAC and hemolymph protein levels. with
   high values in shrimps fed with low CBH levels and maintained in 40
   parts per thousand salinity, and lower in shrimps fed with high CBH and
   maintained in 15 parts per thousand salinity. These differences mean
   that shrimp with a high-gill GDH activity might waste more energy in
   oxidation of the excess proteins and amino acids, reducing the energy
   for growth. It was evident that L. vannamei can convert protein to
   glycogen by a gluconeogenic pathway, which permitted shrimp to maintain
   a minimum circulating glucose of 0.34 mg/ml in hemolymph.
   A high PECPK activity was observed in shrimps fed a diet containing low
   CBH level indicating that the gluconeogenic pathway is activated, as in
   vertebrates by low dietary CBH levels, After a change in diet, we
   observed a change in PEPCK; however, it was lower and seems to depend on
   the way of adaptation, because it occurred after 6 days when adapting to
   a high-CBH diet and with little change for the low-CBH diet. (C) 2001

   and parity the same) case, from such a relation an expression for the
   relativistic virial theorem is deduced. To contribute to the utility of
   the relations, explicit expressions for the radial matrix elements of
   functions of the form r(lambda) and Br-lambda (where beta is a Dirac

Abstract = {The surface states of different diamond surfaces are studied using total
   and partial density of states (DOS) curves, and are related
   qualitatively to the reactivity of these surfaces, which are important
   in the process of diamond growth. The calculations combined atomic and
   functional density approaches with MARVIN and LMTO-ASA codes,
   respectively. In the atomic calculation, the interatomic potentials are
   as follows: the b parameter in the Morse potential is 0.5523 Angstrom,
   the A and B parameters in the nonbonding Lennards-Jonnes potential are
   639.6258 eV Angstrom (12) and 3.632 eV Angstrom (6), and the three-body
   bending potential K-3, is 0.7797 eV rad(2). To validate these results,
   the elastic constants were evaluated, finding a good agreement with the
   experiment. With these potentials, a slab, for each of the diamond
   surfaces, of 40 carbon atoms with periodic conditions in two dimensions
   was optimized. The output coordinates were used for DOS calculations.
   These results were later verified with a surface-cluster calculation of
   HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals. These were calculated using a 9-carbon
   cluster with the DGauss code. In a nonrelaxed surface, two surface
   states are identified: the first is an occupied state placed at the
   center of the gap, and the other, adjacent to a valence band maximum, is
   an empty state of p character and, therefore, potentially able to
   participate in chemical interactions. In the relaxation process of the
   surface, the surface states become narrower as the valences of the
   surface carbons are saturated; in this case the isolated p state
   participates in dangling bonds. With the monohydrogenation, the surface
   state placed at the center of the gap of the relaxed surface, becomes a
   subsurface state, that is, the highest density is not at the surface
   layer, but in inner layers. As a consequence, the reactivity diminishes.
   Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the study of surface states
   could give predictive information about the reactivity of surfaces.},

Abstract = {Growth rate, soluble-protein content and digestive-enzyme activities
   were studied in Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931) early post-larvae
   under six feeding regimens, which included combinations of freshly
   hatched Artemia nauplii, an artificial diet and algae, Growth (0.11 mg
   DW day(-1)) and soluble-protein content (61.8 mug protein larvae(-1) at
   PL(10)) of post-larvae fed mixed diets were significantly higher (P <
   0.05), An artificial diet used alone or co-fed with algae caused the
   lowest growth (0.03-0.05 mg DW day(-1)) and soluble-protein content
   (13.7-15.5 <mu>g protein larvae(-1) at PL(10)), Trypsin-like activity
   was higher (up to 10 times) in post-larvae fed Artemia nauplii and an
   artificial diet alone or plus algae. The artificial diet stimulated
   chymotrypsin activity, apparently in response to squid meal present in
   this diet. Amylase activity increased when post-larvae were fed the
   artificial diet. This was apparently related more to the origin of the
   starch than to the total carbohydrate level of the diet, No obvious
   relationship was found between enzyme activity and growth in any feed
   combination, Based on growth and soluble-protein content, we determined
   that partial substitution (50\%) of Artemia nauplii by artificial diet
   and the use of algae co-fed beyond the first post-larval stage benefits
   growth and the nutritional state of L. vannamei post-larvae.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {From a theoretical point of view we study the hydraulic conductivity
   that appears at the generalized Darcy law of non-saturated soils. The
   relation between the hydraulic conductivity and the water's volumetric
   content is established from the hypothesis that microscopic and
   macroscopic levels of water movement are described by Poiseuille and
   Darcy's laws, respectively We made a distinction between pore radius
   that define areal porosity and volumetric porosity in the emergence of
   macroscopic law from the microscopic law The relation between radius and
   porosities has been established from tortuosity concepts of the movement
   paths of water and The correlation between pores. Concepts Mat are based
   on the relation between total volumetric porosity and soil's fractal
   dimension, This distinction has lead into a conceptual hydraulic
   conductivity model, to which has been introduced the classic hypothesis
   relative to radius weights in the resistence offered to movement of
   water by soil. This, in turn, has allowed to obtain different particular
   models. A simplification of these models has given way to reencounter
   the classic models proposed in Me literature. The empiric corrections
   made to classic models of hydraulic conductivity relative to hydraulic
   conductivity by saturation, are justified in the formalism of fractal
   geometry The correction depends on the value of the fractal dimension of
   each soil type.},

Abstract = {To determine the resources utilized, three species of solitary bees of
   Jalisco, Mexico, were investigated by microscopic pollen analysis of
   nest cell contents and pollen loads of females. By this measure, Centris
   analis Fabricius and C. trigonoides Lepeletier were polylectic without
   strong preference for a single plant family, visiting flowers of
   Flaccourtiaceae, Leguminosae, Malpighiaceae and Solanaceae, mainly. C.
   nitida F. Smith was also polylectic; its most important sources are
   Malpighiaceae, Myrtaceae and Solanaceae, sometimes with a strong
   preference for the Malpighiaceae (88\%).
   These species visit a wide spectrum of flowers, C analis 23 species, C
   nitida 46 and C trigonoides 16, but only a few species were of
   importance (greater than or equal to10\%). C nitida visited more plant
   species to obtain resources and displayed a homogeneous foraging
   behavior. C. analis and C. trigonoides forage fewer resources and these
   were exploited in a heterogeneous way. Samples of the three species
   showed lower values of similarity in terms of the sources visited.},

   combining 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), Picloram
   (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid), N-6-benzyladenine (BA) or
   adenine (6-aminopurine). The highest induction of organogenic callus was
   obtained with formulations containing 1 mg l(-1) (4.52 muM) 2,4-D plus
   0.5 mg l(-1) (2.22 muM) BA, and 2 mg l(-1) (8.88 muM) BA plus 1 mg l(-1)
   (4.14 muM) Picloram with or without 40 mg l(-1) (296.08 muM) adenine.
   Lower frequencies of induction were obtained for embryogenic as compared
   to organogenic callus. The most efficient treatments for induction of
   embryogenic callus contained 2 mg l(-1) (9.05 muM 2,4-D combined with
   0.25 (1.11 muM) or 0.50 mg l(-1) (2.22 muM) BA, or 1 mg l(-1) (4.52 muM)
   2,4-D with 0.50 mg l(-1) (2.22 muM) BA. Regeneration was achieved in
   hormone-free Murashige anmd Skoog (MS) medium, half-strength MS medium
   or MS medium plus 1 mg l(-1) (1.44 muM) gibberellic acid. The number of
   plantlets regenerated per 500 mg callus fresh weight on MS medium ranged
   from 9 for 2 mg l(-1) (9.05 muM) 2,4-D to 62.2 for induction medium
   containing 2 mg l(-1) (8.28 muM) Picloram, 1 mg l(-1) (4.44 muM) BA and

Abstract = {Larvae belonging to the family Sabellariidae (Polychaeta) were collected
   from the Gulf of California and in the Bahia de Banderas, on the west
   coast of Mexico. The oldest stages were selected for identification. The
   presence of three parathoracic segments and one pair of opercular hooks
   led to the genus Idanthyrsus. Identification at the species level was
   more difficult, although I. armatopsis is a serious possibility. This is
   the first description of the planktonic larval stage of a representative
   of the genus Idanthyrsus. The authors draw attention to the usefulness
   of a precise description of certain features, such as the morphology of
   uncini, or of the primary opercular paleae. which simplifies the task of
   identifying larvae at the species level. Comparison inside the family,
   between species whose development is known, confirms the homogeneous
   ontogenesis and suggests strong phyletic constraints. Then emerge the
   questions of reproduction for specimens living over a large bathymetric
   range and the origin of larvae collected in the open sea.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated changes in crustacean hyperglycaemic
   hormone (CHH) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) immunoreactivity
   in the retina and the X-organ/sinus gland complex (XO-SG) of the
   crayfish Procambarus clarkii at two developmental stages, post-embryonic
   stage two (PO2) and the juvenile stage, at three different times of day,
   under a photoperiod cycle of 12h:12h L:D, using qualitative and
   quantitative inmunohistochemical methods, In the retina, CHH
   immunoreactivity is located in the tapetal cells, while 5-HT
   immunoreactivity is found in the retinular cells. In the XO-SG,
   CHH-immunoreactivity is localized to the CHH-producing cell perikarya
   and in their axons and endings in the sinus gland, while 5-HT
   immunoreactivity is restricted to axon endings branching into the
   perikarya of the CHH- producing cells. A stereological analysis
   demonstrates that the PO2 and juvenile stages show significant
   differences in the amount of the immunoreactive CHH and 5-HT material at
   the three selected time points, indicating daily and related changes in
   the levels of CHH and 5-HT in the XO-SG and the retina. Our findings
   therefore support the idea that daily rhythms in the secretory activity
   of the XO-SG complex affect the circadian sensitivity of the eye.
   Furthermore, the differences found between the PO2 and juvenile stages
   suggest that both CHH and 5-HT are key factors in the development of the
   circadian rhythm of retinal sensitivity.},

   a mathematical model (based on a previous one for the electroretinogram
   circadian rhythm in the same species) simulating those properties. In
   the process of constructing the model we clarified and made precise
   various hypotheses about the biological structures involved in them and
   about the characteristics of the oscillators present in those
   structures. We also formulate some hypotheses about the general
   properties of circadian rhythms. Finally, we propose some experiments

Abstract = {To determine whether seeds of the weedy shrub Wigandia urens, from the
   Valley of Mexico, undergo natural priming when buried in soil,
   comparative experiments were performed with seeds: (1) harvested
   directly from the plants; (2) buried in three natural habitat
   conditions; and (3) laboratory primed with polyethylene glycol. Seeds
   were sown in a growth chamber and in a shade house. final germination
   percentages, emergence, germination and emergence rates, survival and
   initial growth were determined. Burial and priming enhanced the
   germination and emergence parameters evaluated in the laboratory and in
   the shade house. Effects of treatments on survival were not
   significantly different. Nevertheless, burial improved emergence and
   mean survival, and induced differences in specific leaf area of
   seedlings that could have ecological significance. Heat-stable proteins
   were extracted and electrophoresed. Proteins formed in W. urens seeds
   during burial had molecular weights (14-21 kDa) similar to those
   reported for late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins induced by
   priming in other species. Nevertheless. the presence and abundance of
   proteins expressed (14-23, 36 and more than 45 kDa) differed among
   control, primed and buried seeds. During soil burial, molecular and
   physiological responses were induced that were similar to the effects of
   priming.},

   which moves inside the medium with the group velocity. This polarization
   charge induces time-dependent elemental dipoles in the material medium.
   If the group velocity is greater than the phase velocity of light in
   such a medium there is a coherent superposition of the radiation emitted
   by each elemental dipole that gives rise to Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation.
   Two methods to obtain the energy spectrum are developed.},

Abstract = {One of the objectives of the Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve
   (Jalisco, Mexico) is the conservation in situ of the teosinte Zea
   diploperennis Iltis, Doebley, Guzman \& Pazzi. Zea diploperennis is
   perennial, shade intolerant and its 1-3 in shoots are architecturally
   similar to maize. Clonal growth is of the phalanx type. Genets are
   iteroparous (modules semelparous). The demography of seven module and
   genet populations was Studied in seven sites representing three stages
   of old-field succession. Seven permanent one-meter-square plots were
   randomly established in each site. Ail genets initially present and
   those that became established during our study were mapped and labeled
   according to year of establishment The magnitude of demographic
   fluctuations was greater in module populations. Genet population
   dynamics followed a seasonal rhythm with a maximum population size
   obtained at the onset of the rainy season. A relation was documented
   between percent annual mortality of a cohort and its age: the younger
   the cohort, the greater the mortality. This was a statistically
   significant relationship, Y = {[}sin (-0.288x + 1.657)](2) (r = 0.92, p
   < 0.01), where is proportion annual mortality of genets and is the age
   of the cohort. The maximum rates of genet mortality occurred during the
   rainy season when population densities were greatest. As a consequence,
   we postulate that competition occurs principally during the rainy
   season. Linear relationships were observed between rate of population
   increase of genets versus old-field successional stage and soil type.
   Those areas with poor soil (Ultisol), degraded soil or soils with
   similar physical characteristics could be rehabilitated by introducing Z
   diploperennis. Such rehabilitation would achieve two distinct
   objectives, promote propagation of this rare endemic and reclaim areas
   that are susceptible to erosion and further degradation.},

Abstract = {Laurencia venusta Yamada, originally described from the western Pacific
   Ocean, is recorded for the first time from the Atlantic Ocean. It occurs
   in Quintana Roo State, Mexico, which is located on the eastern portion
   of Yucatan Peninsula, Caribbean Sea. The present species belongs;to the
   subgenus Laurencia by-nature of possessing four pericentral cells per
   vegetative axial segment, secondary pit-connections between superficial
   cortical cells, and parallel-type arrangement of the tetrasporangia. The
   principal characteristics for species identification are: pale green
   color, soft and flaccid thalli, verticillate branching, and the presence
   of lenticular thickenings in the walls of medullary cells.},

Abstract = {More than thirty complete specimens of Carcineretes planetarius Vega,
   Feldmann, Ocampo, and Pope, 1997, a member of the extinct decapod family
   Carcineretidae, have been collected from the upper part of the
   Ocozocuautla Formation in Chiapas, southeast Mexico. Stratigraphic
   occurrences of Carcineretes in the Caribbean Province suggest that this
   crab should be regarded as an index fossil for the early Maastrichtian.
   Six samples of this species may represent individuals that died during
   molting. The sudden disappearance of this family at the end of the
   Maastrichtian and its restricted paleobiogeographic distribution in the
   vicinity of the impact site suggest that the Carcineretidae may have
   been affected by the Chicxulub impact. Other decapod specimens collected
   from the same localities were assigned to the Xanthidae; Parazanthopsis
   meyapaquensis new genus and species, and Megaxantho zoque, new genus and
   species, are described. They constitute the second and third reports of
   Cretaceous xanthid crabs from Mexico. A lagoonal paleoenvironment is
   suggested, based on associated fauna and flora. Occurrences of index
   species of benthic and planktic foraminifera along with that of
   diagnostic rudist species confirm an early Maastrichtian age.},

Abstract = {To each immersed complete space-like hypersurface M with constant
   normalized scalar curvature R in the de Sitter space S-1(n+1), we
   associate sup H-2, where H is the mean curvature of M. It is proved that
   the condition sup H-2 less than or equal to C-n((R) over bar), where (R)
   over bar = (R - 1) > 0 and C-n((K) over bar) is a constant depending
   only on R and n, implies that either M is totally umbilical or M is a
   hyperbolic cylinder. It is also proved the sharpness of this result by
   showing the existence of a class of new rotation constant scalar
   curvature hypersurfaces in S-1(n+1) such that sup H-2 > C-n((R) over

Abstract = {The momentum representation is little used in quantum mechanics courses.
   Some students are hence surprised by the change in viewpoint when, in
   doing advanced work, they have to use the momentum rather than the
   coordinate representation. In this work, we give an introduction to
   quantum mechanics in momentum spate. To this end we discuss standard
   ``elementary{''} problems, namely, the free particle, the quantum motion
   under a constant potential function, a particle interacting with a
   potential step function, and the motion of a particle under a
   oscillatory potential function. What is not standard is that they are
   all conceived from momentum space and hence they, with the exception of
   the free particle, are not equivalent to the coordinate space ones with
   the same names. We solve for the bound eigenstates of the problems
   working within the momentum representation trying not to make explicit
   reference to the systems they correspond to in the coordinate
   representation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {184-191},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background/Aims: S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) and
   tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) exert an additive ameliorating effect on
   taurolithocholate (TLC)-induced cholestasis, The aims were to
   investigate the protective effect of SAMe on
   17beta-estradiol-glucuronide (17 beta EG) cholestasis and to find out
   whether SAMe and TUDC may exert an additive, ameliorating effect.
   Methods: Hepatocyte couplet function was assessed by canalicular
   vacuolar accumulation (cVA) of cholyllysylfluorescein (CLF), Cells were
   co-treated with 17 beta EG and SAMe, TUDC, or both (protection study),
   or treated with 17 beta EG and then with SAMe, TUDC or both (reversion
   study) before CLF uptake. Couplets were also co-treated with SAMe and
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a competitive substrate for the
   sulfotransferase involved in 17 beta EG detoxification, The effects of
   17 beta EG, SAMe and TUDC were also examined on intracellular
   distribution of F-actin.
   Results: Both SAMe and TUDC significantly protected against, and
   reversed, 17 beta EG-induced cholestasis, but their effects were not
   additive. DHEA abolished the protective effect of SAMe, 17 beta EG did
   not affect the uptake of CLF into hepatocytes at the concentrations
   used, and also, it did not affect the intracellular distribution of
   F-actin.
   Conclusions: 17 beta EG does not affect the uptake of CLF into
   hepatocytes, SAMe and TUDC protect and reverse 17 beta EG-induced
   cholestasis, but without an additive effect. Protection by SAMe may
   involve facilitating the sulfation of 17 beta EG. (C) 2001 European

Abstract = {The study of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of clonal
   growth in vascular plants has been widely addressed; however, marine
   macroalgae, which are interesting modular organisms that combine
   `simple' morphologies and complex life cycles, have been almost ignored.
   This paper presents a review and analysis of the ecological and
   evolutionary consequences of clonality in marine macroalgae, including
   three main subjects: (1) modular construction (modules and ramets); (2)
   life cycle and evolutionary perspectives, and (3) ecological
   perspectives of clonality in marine macroalge. The biological emergent
   attributes of clonality are present in marine macroalgae e.g. high
   longevity of the genet by the continual renewal of modules, and variable
   morphological plasticity of ramets and modules in relation to
   environmental conditions. However, experimental work is still needed to
   solve questions such as the effect of crowding on survival rates and use
   of resources, as well as its effect on sexual or asexual patterns of
   reproduction. I expect that the study of the evolutionary consequences
   of the combined presence of alternation of generations and clonal growth
   in marine macroalgae will make important contributions to clonal plant
   theory.},

Abstract = {The current study was carried out to investigate whether the
   photoperiodic induction of ovarian maturation in crayfish is based on a
   photosensitive rhythm related to extraretinal photoreceptors. To test
   this, two batches of 61 juvenile crayfish Procambarus clarkii consisting
   of (1) intact organisms and (2) animals lacking retina and lamina were
   exposed to 24h light-dark cycles of different photoperiodic schedules
   based on a night-break protocol for 3 months. Both batches of crayfish
   showed the greatest ovarian maturation (size, color, degree and size of
   oocytes) when the light pulse interrupted the scotophase at 21:00 and
   05:00, showing a bimodal photoinducible rhythm. Results of the current
   study indicate that crayfish ovarian maturation depends on a
   photoinducible rhythm with two possible states that is related to the
   circadian clock of crayfish. This phenomenon is mediated by extraretinal
   photoreceptors. Results are interpreted in the light of models of
   external coincidence.},

Abstract = {Biogeographical affinities among cloud forests in the Neotropical region
   were studied through a track approach., by constructing generalised
   tracks based on the results of a parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE).
   Distributional data on 946 genera and 1,266 species of vascular plants
   (Pteridophyta. angiosperms, and gymnosperms) from 26 cloud forest
   patches from Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico,
   Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela were analysed; and four localities from
   eastern and western United States were also included as outgroups. The
   track analysis identified six generalised trac a first one that includes
   the majority of the cloud forests of Mexico, Central America, the
   Antilles and northern Colombia; a second one that includes southern
   Mexico and northern Central America a third one that includes the
   mountains in northwestern South America; a fourth one that includes the
   mountains in southwestern South America; and two others in western and
   eastern United States. It is concluded that the Neotropical cloud
   forests are closely related and that those of the Caribbean subregion
   exhibit complex relationships, which could be due to the complex
   tectonic history of the area.},

Pages = {111-115},
Abstract = {The energies of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states of the
   two-dimensional electron gas are evaluated and compared in order to
   determine the magnetic character of the ground state. The calculations
   are made with the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation and the
   deformable jellium model. Several transition points between different
   magnetic phases are obtained. At very high densities of r(s) approximate
   to 2 a first transition is obtained from a paramagnetic fluid to a
   ferromagnetic one. At r(st1) approximate to 4.8 a symmetry and magnetic
   transition is obtained from a ferromagnetic fluid to a paramagnetic
   localized state with a periodic density centered on a hexagonal lattice.
   A ferromagnetic localized state is predicted at lower densities. The
   results are compared with those reported for the system with square
   symmetry. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Murine exposure to silica is associated with enhanced tumor necrosis
   factor alpha (TNF-alpha) expression and matrix deposition. The
   regulation of TNF is mediated through TNF receptor (TNFR) activation of
   transcription factors. In the present work we have studied the
   importance of the individual TNFR in silica-induced lung inflammation
   and matrix deposition in mice. We studied RNA expression of TNF,
   alpha1(I) collagen, interstitial collagenase (MMP-13), and its inhibitor
   (TIMP-1) in the lungs of silica-treated mice. Furthermore, we correlated
   MMP-13/TIMP-1 RNA abundance with activation of the transcription factors
   AP-1 and NF-kappaB in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice, and of mice deficient
   in one of the two types of TNFR (p55(-/-) or p75(-/-)), exposed to
   silica (0.2 g/kg) or saline by intratracheal instillation. Animals were
   killed 28 d after exposure and lung hydroxyproline (HP), TNF, alpha1(I)
   collagen, MMP-13, and TIMP-1 RNA abundance was measured. AP-1 and
   NF-kappaB activation was studied by gel-shift assays. Compared with
   C57BL/6 mice, p55(-/-) and p75(-/-) mice significantly ({*}p < 0.05)
   decreased lung HP accumulation in response to silica. All murine strains
   enhanced TNF and <alpha>1(I) collagen mRNA in response to silica.
   Enhanced (p < 0.05) MMP-13 RNA expression was also observed in all
   murine strains in response to silica. Enhanced (p < 0.05) TIMP-1 RNA
   expression was observed in C57BL/6 mice, but not in p55(-/-) or p75(-/-)
   mice, in response to silica. NF-KB activation was observed in all murine
   strains, whereas AP-1 activation was observed only in C57BL/6 mice after
   silica treatment. These data suggest that TNFR deletion modifies
   MMP-13/TIMP-1 expression in favor of matrix degradation.},

Abstract = {We examined the well-known spontaneous discharge (SD) and light-evoked
   (PD) discharge of the crayfish caudal photoreceptor for the possible
   existence of a daily rhythm in spike frequency. To do this, we isolated
   the abdominal nerve cord in vitro and studied its discharge frequency in
   constant darkness. Single cosinor analysis revealed significant SD and
   PD circadian rhythms (P < .05) with periods tau = 24.4h and 24.2h,
   respectively. These oscillations correspond to an endogenous circadian
   discharge of the caudal photoreceptor that is enhanced by light. The
   importance of this rhythm in the adaptive behavior of crayfish is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Growth rate, soluble-protein content, oxygen consumption, ammonia
   excretion, and digestive-enzyme activity were studied in Litopenaeus
   setiferus early postlarvae under four feeding regimens that included
   combinations of freshly hatched Artemia nauplii, microparticulate
   commercial diet, and algae. Growth and of postlarvae fed a mixed diet
   were significantly higher. Artificial diet used alone caused the lowest
   growth, lowest soluble-protein content, higher ammonia excretion, lowest
   O:N ratio, and higher proteolytic and amylase activities. The artificial
   diet stimulated proteolytic activity and ammonia excretion of
   postlarvae, apparently in response to some deficiency in protein
   composition of the diet. Based on results in growth, soluble-protein
   content, enzymatic activity, and metabolic substrate, we determined that
   partial substitution of Artemia nauplii by artificial diet, with or
   without addition of algae when rearing early postlarval stages, will
   benefit the growth and nutritional state of L. setiferus postlarvae. (C)

Abstract = {Several data partitions, including nuclear and mitochondrial gene
   sequences, chromosomes, isoenzymes, and morphological characters, were
   used to propose a new phylogeny and to test previously published
   hypotheses about the phylogenetic positions of basal clades of the
   lizard genus Sceloporus and the relationship of Sceloporus to the former
   genus ``Sator{''}. In accord with earlier studies, our results grouped
   ``Sator{''} as internal to Sceloporus, and both support a hypothesis of
   transgulfian vicariance for the origin of the former genus ``Sator{''}
   on islands in the Sea of Cortez. Robustness of support for internal
   nodes in our best tree was established though widely used indices
   (bootstrap proportions, decay values) but also through congruence among
   independent data partitions. Several deep nodes in the tree recovered by
   several methods, including equally weighted and differentially weighted
   parsimony and maximum likelihood models, are only weakly supported by
   the traditional indices. This methodological concordance is taken as
   evidence for insensitivity of the deep structure of the topology to
   alternative assumptions.},

Abstract = {We use the Boltzmann transport equation to calculate the
   three-dimensional (3D) version of the Landauer equation for incoherent
   electrons diffusing in a slab of amorphous material. We use the P-1
   approximation to calculate the multiple-scattering transmission
   coefficient as a function of the diffusion coefficient. The 3D
   transmission coefficient is, apart from numerical coefficients, similar
   to that for 1D. The result is valid only for positions far away from the
   boundaries and for slabs having a thickness much greater than one mean
   free path.},

Abstract = {The effect was studied of sunlight and far-red (FR) light during seed
   development. on seed quality and germination of Sicyos deppei G. Don.
   Seeds exposed to FR during development were lighter in colour and their
   weight. size and water content were significantly lower. Less than 10\%
   of non-scarified freshly harvested seeds germinated. Scarified, freshly
   harvested seeds developed under sunlight had a partially negative
   photoblastic response: both red (R) and FR light inhibited germination.
   The highest and fastest germination occurred in darkness, probably due
   to the effect of the high photon flux densities on the phytochrome
   during seed development. Scarified seeds ripened under FR light,
   germinated well in FR light and in darkness, but R light inhibited
   germination. After 6 months of storage, the permeability of S. deppei
   seeds increased, the partially negative photoblastic response was lost
   and germination of scarified seeds increased. Specifically. in seeds
   developed under FR. germination in darkness was faster than for the
   other light treatments, but slow in darkness for seeds developed under
   sunlight. The physiological and morphological heteroblastic responses in
   S. deppei probably extend its seed germination and seedling recruitment
   periods.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that the tropical seagrass, Thalassia testudinum from the
   Puerto Morelos reef lagoon (Mexican Caribbean) has a dormant apical
   meristem bank (as opposed to a dormant axillary meristem bank) was
   investigated by morphological and anatomical analyses of vertical shoot
   apices. Shoots were grouped as follows: (1) dead shoots (no foliar
   structures or active meristems), (2) developed shoots (bearing juvenile
   or mature foliar structures with active meristems), and (3) undeveloped
   shoots (bearing rudimentary foliar structures but with active
   meristems). In two beds, regressions of shoot density vs. proportional
   number of shoots in each of the above-mentioned categories, had negative
   slopes for developed shoots and positive slopes for undeveloped shoots,
   whereas no relationship was found between density and proportion of dead
   shoots, These data suggested that foliar shoot density was regulated by
   inhibition of foliar development, through suppression of meristem
   activity. Foliar shoot density increased significantly after
   experimental nutrient addition ana density of the developed shoots was
   544.3 shoots per meter square for control plots and 1044.1 shoots per
   meter square for fertilised plots. Density of undeveloped decreased
   after fertilisation and densities were 623.9 and 194.2 shoots per meter
   square for control and fertilised plots, respectively, indicating that
   nutrient addition resulted in meristem re-activation in the
   ``undeveloped{''} group. These results confirm the previous proposed
   existence of a dormant apical meristem banks for T. testudinum. (C) 2000

Abstract = {A reanalysis of the radio continuum emission from circumnuclear regions
   of the barred galaxies NGC 1022, NGC 1326, and NGC 4314 is presented.
   The spatial distributions of Ha and radio continuum are similar and
   suggest the existence of several giant H II regions in the circumnuclear
   zone. The spectral indices of the H 11 regions, obtained with similar
   angular resolution and at three different wavelengths, indicate that in
   all three galaxies alpha (6)(2) > -0.1. This result suggests the
   existence of giant H II regions with decreasing density gradients. The
   average density stratifications of these H 11 regions could be
   approximated by power laws of the form n(e) proportional to r(-omega),
   with exponents in the range 1.6 < omega < 2.4.},

Abstract = {A wave-driven seawater pump, composed of a resonant and an exhaust duct
   joined by a variable-volume air compression chamber, is studied. The
   time dependent form of Bernoulli's equation, adapted to incorporate
   losses due to friction, vortex formation at the mouths and radiation
   damping, describes the pump behaviour. A dimensional analysis of the
   pump equations shows that a proposed scale-model will perform similar to
   a full-scale seawater pump. Fluid oscillations in the ducts perform
   similar to a damped, two-mass spring system, excited by the waves. A
   resonant condition can be maintained, for different wave frequencies, by
   varying the volume of air in the compression chamber. The dimensional
   analysis shows that the basic behaviour of the pump is linear and that
   its performance can be significantly increased by optimising the design
   of the duct mouths. Linear estimates of the resonant air chamber volume
   and flow rate through the pump are derived. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Flume experiments with a scale-model of a wave driven seawater pump in
   monochromatic waves are described. A tuning mechanism optimises the pump
   performance by keeping it at resonance with the waves. The pumping
   process itself was found to de-tune the system because of the reduced
   gravity restoring force due to spilling in the compression chamber. A
   perturbation analysis of the pump equations shows that performance of
   the system can be increased by optimising the shape of the pump intake
   to minimise losses due to vortex formation. An algorithm is derived,
   using a numerical model of the pump, which accurately determines the
   required volume of air in the compression chamber to induce resonance
   given variations in the wave frequency, the wave height and the tides. A
   sustainable development project to use a seawater pump to manage
   fisheries at a coastal lagoon in Mexico is described. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {During lung injury, fibroblasts migrate into the alveolar spaces where
   they can be exposed to pulmonary surfactant. We examined the effects of
   Survanta and surfactant protein A (SP-A) on fibroblast growth and
   apoptosis and on type I collagen, collagenase-1, and tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 expression. Lung fibroblasts were treated
   with 100, 500, and 1,000 mg/ml of Survanta; 10, 50, and 100 mg/ml of
   SP-A; and 500 mg/ml of Survanta plus 50 mg/ml of SP-A. Growth rate was
   evaluated by a formazan-based chromogenic assay, apoptosis was evaluated
   by DNA end labeling and ELISA, and collagen, collagenase-1, and TIMP-1
   were evaluated by Northern blotting. Survanta provoked fibroblast
   apoptosis, induced collagenase-1 expression, and decreased type I
   collagen affecting mRNA stability similar to 10-fold as assessed with
   the use of actinomycin D. Collagen synthesis and collagenase activity
   paralleled the gene expression results. SP-A increased collagen
   expression similar to2-fold and had no effect on collagenase-1, TIMP-1,
   or growth rate. When fibroblasts were exposed to a combination of
   Survanta plus SP-A, the effects of Survanta were partially reversed.
   These findings suggest that surfactant lipids may protect against
   intraluminal fibrogenesis by inducing fibroblast apoptosis and
   decreasing collagen accumulation.},

Abstract = {The Gulf of Tehuantepec, in the Mexican waters of the eastern tropical
   Pacific, is a very productive area with a high biological complexity, as
   the result of a wind-induced upwelling that occurs from November to
   February. The main assemblages of pelagic copepods in this region were
   identified and analysed in this study, during the final stage of the
   upwelling process. Samples were collected in oblique plankton hauls
   using a station grid that covered neritic and oceanic waters. Copepods
   were separated taking 10 mi aliquots from each sample. Data of copepod
   abundance were expressed as ind. m(-3) and subjected to a Factor
   Correspondence Analysis, in order to determine the main copepod
   assemblages. Results indicate the presence of two main assemblages:
   neritic and oceanic. The neritic assemblage is located on shelf waters.
   Its characteristic species are Microsetella norvergica, Macrasetella
   gracilis, Nannocalanus minor; Centropages vitrea. Corycaeus speciosus,
   and Eucalanus subcrassus. The oceanic assemblage includes Copilia
   vitrea, Eucalanus inermis, Scolecithricella abyssalis, Haloptilus spp.,
   and Rhincalanus spp. The composition of those assemblages corresponds to
   the physiography of the area, and this strong variation gradient fi um
   the coast to the ocean has been commonly observed in other assemblages
   of planktonic organisms as well.},

Abstract = {Zygotic embryos of Picea chihuahuana Martinet were cultivated in vitro
   to determine the time of organogenic competence and to maximize
   adventitious bud induction. The induction medium consisted of modified
   B5 substrate supplemented with N-6-benzyladenine (with or without
   naphthalene acetic acid) or kinetin (with or without 2-4,
   dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) at different concentrations and induction
   times. The minimum induction time required for bud formation was 14 d
   with kinetin and 17 d with N-6-benzyladenine. After induction embryos
   were transferred to the proliferation medium (modified B5 substrate with
   50\% of its components and without growth regulators) for 30 d. The
   subsequent buds were transferred every 15 d to Schenk and Hildebrandt
   medium at half its concentration without growth regulators. The most
   effective treatments were 3 and 5 mg l(-1) kinetin or N-6-benzyladenine
   which produced five to seven buds per embryo. The largest shoots were
   subjected to rooting trials with pulses of different concentrations of
   indole butyric acid resulting in only one bud developing a root.
   Histological analysis revealed clusters of three to four cells that
   became more evident as induction time increased. Kinetin promoted the
   development of an organized structure prior to adventitious buds
   formation sooner than N-6-benzyladenine. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany

Abstract = {We present differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray
   diffractometry, in situ Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS, and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) studies in Metglas ribbons subjected to
   different heat treatments. The temperature evolution of the hyperfine
   field H-hf(T) and the Curie temperature (T,) of the amorphous phase are
   determined. The magnetic field originally present in the amorphous phase
   has a `normal' behavior, in the sense that it can be described by the
   Weiss molecular field theory. The total angular momentum of the iron
   atoms turns out to be 512 and this implies Fe3+ in which the electronic
   spins are uncoupled. When the samples are maintained near T-c (
   approximate to 673 K), three new magnetic phases are detected in the
   Mossbauer spectra. indicating an onset of a crystallization process well
   below the first crystallization temperature (T-X1), as determined by DSC
   ( approximate to 820 K). The magnetic behavior of these phases is also
   described by universal Brillouin curves with J(1) = 3/2, J(2) = 5/2 and
   J(3) = 5/2. A pre-identification of the crystalline phases is made
   through the Mossbauer parameters of the three observed magnetic phases,
   and the final characterization by X-ray and electron diffraction. Two of
   the three phases were identified as alpha -FeSi and Fe2B. The third
   phase could be the cubic phase of Fe3Si or a solid solution of FeSi. The
   size of the nanocrystals formed in a sample heated at 673 K during
   different time intervals were determined by TEM, Even though the number
   of the nanocrystals increases with time, their average size remains the
   same. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The algal community of a small marine lagoon in the tropical Mexican
   Caribbean Sea was studied for 3 years (1994-1997). Filamentous algae
   dominated the vegetation and calcareous crusts were the principal
   understory algae, The filamentous algae formed dense mats, their cover
   showing seasonal variation, ranging between 30\% in late winter and
   early spring, and 80\% in summer and autumn. Hurricane Roxane (October
   1995) caused increased sedimentation, accompanied by a considerable
   reduction in cover of the filamentous algae. Cover reached pre-hurricane
   levels within approximate to 11 months. Herbivorous fishes (mainly
   scarids) maintained specific feeding areas, which they cleared of
   filamentous algae, however, they did not control the filamentous algae
   throughout the lagoon. Water movement was almost completely absent in
   the lagoon of Chankanaab Park, which together with the low herbivore
   pressure, were most likely responsible for the unique environment, where
   a vegetation dominated by thick filamentous mats formed the climax
   community.},

Abstract = {We calculate the nonlinear dipole and quadrupole moments induced at the
   second-harmonic (SW) frequency 2 omega in a small dielectric sphere by
   an inhomogeneous monochromatic electric field of frequency omega. We
   neglect finite-size effects and assume that the selvedge region of the
   sphere is thin enough so that the surface may be considered locally
   flat. The second-order dipole displays resonances corresponding to the
   excitation of dipolar and quadrupolar plasmons at w and a dipolar
   plasmon at 2 omega, besides the resonances in the nonlinear surface
   response parameters a, b, and f. The second-order quadrupole, on the
   other hand, has resonances corresponding to those of a, b, and f, and to
   the excitation of dipolar surface plasmons at omega only. Depending on
   the relation between the size of the sphere and the spatial scale of
   variation of the field, the SH radiation may be dominated by either
   dipolar or quadrupolar scattering, with a crossover region. As an
   application, we calculate the SH scattering of a Si sphere lying at
   various distances above a dielectric substrate.},

Abstract = {Two species of marine mites belonging to the families Hyadesiidae and
   Halacaridae, Hyadesia sp. and Copidognathus sp., respectively, were
   found associated with the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from Baja
   California in NW Mexico. The first species was found inside the mussel
   gut with an intensity ranging from one to six mites per mussel and their
   prevalence was from 20.0 to 46.7\%; this species was also found living
   free in the sediment at a density of 0.7 mite/100 ml. The second species
   was found on the mantle and gills of the host with an intensity ranging
   from one to three mites per host and their prevalence was from 3.3 to
   6.7\%; this species was abundant (4.5 mites/100 ml) and living free in
   the sediment around mussel clumps. Hyadesia sp. was found alive and
   attached in the gut of the mussel. A histological analysis revealed this
   species in the lumen of intestine surrounded by mucus and attached to
   the epithelial cells of the intestine, where some disorder of epithelial
   cells was associated. Moreover, this mite may be encapsulated by
   hemocytes inside the digestive diverticulum, the reproductive follicle,
   or the connective tissue surrounding the diverticulum. No damages to
   branches or gills resulting from the presence of Copidognathus sp. were
   observed. The results suggest that these mites are occasional invaders
   of mussels; however, as a result of this infestation, Hyadesia sp. may
   produce damage in the host's tissues. This is the first record of marine
   mites inside the gut, reproductive follicles, branches, and mantle of a
   marine bivalve. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {One of the basic assumptions of the meaningfull learning of a concept

   maximum contrastability with the preconcepts of the student. It is
   assumed that the axiomatic construction of the concept to teach is the
   neatest form of its presentation to the student. Starting from a
   ``preliminary object{''}. which is a collective of data generated by a
   physical system (like the positions of a brownian particle), the
   probability associated to the collective is constructed by means of a
   set of axioms. From the transitivity or zeroth axiom postulated for the
   ``place selection{''} operation of von Mises {[}R. Von Mises,
   Probability, Statistics and Truth. (Dover Publications, Inc., USA,
   1981)] it is deduced that probability exists as an objective property of
   the collective. The other axioms complete the remaining aspects of
   probability as an intrinsic property of the random systems, by means of
   which probability calculations or ``predictions{''} could be performed,
   subjected to experimental testing.},

Abstract = {In recent years, use of databases of the labels of specimens deposited
   in museums and herbaria is becoming increasingly common as a tool for
   addressing biodiversity conservation and management problems. These
   databases are often large in size and complex in structure, and their
   application to conservation deserves a wider appreciation of some of the
   biases, gaps and potential pitfalls common to them. In this paper, we
   discuss some of the problems associated with using such databases for
   obtaining lists of species for arbitrary sites, as well as for the
   estimation of the distribution area of single species. The possibility
   of obtaining these closely related variables using specimen databases is
   shown to be scale-dependent. A tool based on mark-recapture techniques
   is applied to the problem of: (i) detecting sites with low number of
   species due to lack of adequate in-site sampling and, (ii) species with
   small estimated areas due to poor spatial coverage of samples.},

Abstract = {The discovery of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway for the
   biosynthesis of isoprenoids raises the important question of the nature
   and regulation of the enzymes involved in this pathway. CLA1, a gene
   previously isolated from Arabidopsis, encodes the first enzyme of the
   2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway,
   1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase. We demonstrate this enzyme
   activity by complementation of the cla1-1 mutant phenotype and by direct
   enzymatic assays. Based on mRNA and protein expression patterns this
   enzyme is expressed mainly in developing photosynthetic and
   non-photosynthetic tissues. The beta-glucuronidase expression pattern
   driven from the CLA1. gene regulatory region supports the northern and
   protein data while also showing that this gene has some level of
   expression in most tissues of the plant. A mutation in the CLA1 gene
   interferes with the normal development of chloroplasts and etioplasts,
   but does not seem to affect amyloplast structure. Microscopic analysis
   also shows a pleiotropic effect of the CLA1 gene mutation in mesophyll
   tissue formation.},

Abstract = {1. We analysed the number and size of different ovarian cell
   subpopulations of newly-hatched chicks bl; ovarian cell suspension count
   and morphometric/stereological methods as well as Delta (5)-3 beta
   -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Delta (5) -3 beta HSD) activity in these
   cells created in vivo with LH during embryonic development.
   2. Fertile White Leghorn eggs received 1 mug LH applied to the
   chorioallantoic membrane on days 13, 15, and 17 of incubation. All
   animals were killed within 2 1 h after hatching, the left ovary was
   dissected and processed.
   3. The results indicate that the number of germ, pregranulosa,
   interstitial and undifferentiated cells was not affected by LH
   treatment. However, we observed an increase in the size of individual
   interstitial cells of the ovarian medulla. In these cells, Delta (5) -3
   beta HSD activity was increased in response to LH.
   4. These findings suggest that LH does not exert a proliferative effect
   on the cells of tie prefollicular ovary of the chick and that
   interstitial cells can be target cells for LH, increasing their
   steroidogenic activity due to LH treatment.},

Abstract = {Fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation
   characterize idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We evaluated the
   presence of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, -2, -3, and
   -4; collagenase-1, -2, and -3; gelatinases A and B; and membrane type 1
   matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in 12 IPF and 6 control lungs. TIMP-1 was
   found in interstitial macrophages and TIMP-2 in fibroblast foci. TIMP-3
   revealed an intense staining mainly decorating the elastic lamina in
   vessels. TIMP-4 was expressed in IPF lungs by epithelial and plasma
   cells. TIMP-2 colocalized with Ki67 in fibroblasts, whereas TIMP-3
   colocalized with p27 in inflammatory and epithelial cells. Collagenase-1
   was localized in macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells,
   collagenase-2 was localized in a few neutrophils, and collagenase-3 was
   not detected. MMP-9 was found in neutrophils and subepithelial
   myofibroblasts. Myofibroblast expression of MMP-9 was corroborated in
   vitro by RT-PCR. MMP-2 was noticed in myofibroblasts, some of them close
   to areas of basement membrane disruption, and membrane type 1 MMP was
   noticed in interstitial macrophages. These findings suggest that in IPF
   there is higher expression of TIMPs compared with collagenases,
   supporting the hypothesis that a nondegrading fibrillar collagen
   microenvironment is prevailing.},

Title = {Quetzal abundance in relation to fruit availability in a cloud forest in

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {The Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) is an altitudinal migrant
   that nests in high elevation cloud forests and migrates toward lower
   areas during the summer rainy season. It has been suggested that its
   migratory movements are related to the abundance of ripe Lauraceae
   fruits. We studied the quetzal diet during two consecutive years, as
   well as changes in fruit abundance of the plant species on which the
   bird feeds at El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, southeastern Mexico. The
   quetzal was observed Feeding on 32 plant species; of these, 24 are new
   records in its diet. We chose 20 of these 32 species and studied their
   fruit phenology for two years in order to describe the relationship
   between fruit and quetzal abundance. Our results showed that quetzal
   abundance in the breeding area was correlated with the total number of
   fruiting species, whereas the correlation between quetzal abundance and
   the number of fruiting Lauraceae species was only marginal.
   Additionally, a correlation test showed that quetzal abundance was
   marginally correlated with total fruit availability (total no. of fruits
   per month); however, the correlation between quetzal abundance and the
   number of fruits in the Lauraceae was not significant. Our results
   suggest that the dynamics of food resources may be playing a major role
   in the quetzal's migratory behavior. Knowing the bird's diet may aid in
   characterizing the type of habitat adequate for its conservation. Our
   observations in this respect suggest that conservation efforts to
   preserve this bird species should concentrate on the protection of its
   habitat, including both breeding and nonbreeding (migration) locations.},

Volume = {245},

Abstract = {Although folliculogenesis and oogenesis have been observed in numerous
   reptiles, these phenomena have not been described in detail in a
   crocodilian. Oogenesis and histological features of the adult ovary of
   Alligator mississippiensis are described. Using a complex process, the
   ovary develops telolecithal oocytes that attain a diameter of 38.8 +/-
   2.4 mm. The morphology of yolk platelets shows gradual changes
   throughout the oogenic process. Initially, yolk platelets are seen
   surrounded by a vesicle. As vitellogenesis advances, the vesicles
   contain numerous yolk spheres, with slowly growing platelets. The yolk
   spheres continue to increase in size and number within the vacuoles.
   Differences in the animal and vegetal poles are seen based on the
   morphology and size of the yolk platelets. The ovary of A.
   mississippiensis shows a well-developed system of lacunae and bundles of
   smooth muscle around the follicles in all stages of development. Several
   features seen in the ovary of A. mississippiensis are similar to those
   observed in birds. In particular, the morphology of the yolk platelets,
   especially during the middle and late vitellogenic stages, and the
   presence of a ovarian system of lacunae and smooth muscle. These
   similarities in the reproductive biology of crocodilians and birds
   contribute to current studies of the evolution of archosaurian
   reproduction. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The volcano mouse Neotomodon alstoni alstoni is a genus endemic to the
   higher elevations of the Mexican transvolcanic belt. In the present
   study we examined for the first time the morphological features of the
   spermatozoa taken from the caudal epididymis of this species by
   transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Spermatozoan motility was
   studied in sucrose and bicarbonate solutions; vitality and morphology
   were observed by light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy
   shows that the head of spermatozoon is asymmetric and possesses a large
   and curved hook. The axoneme of the spermatozoan tail is highly
   developed at fibers 1, 5, and 6. Absolute and relative measurements of
   the length of the head, the midpiece, and the rest of the tail were also
   obtained. N. alstoni alstoni spermatozoa were hyperactive in the
   presence of 290 mM sucrose and 10 and 20 nM bicarbonate solutions
   exhibited high motility (180-190 mu m/sec), and high flagellum beating
   frequency (10-12 Hz). In contrast, the spermatozoa in 310 mM sucrose
   solution showed scarce motility (13.5 +/- 3.8 mu m/sec) and low beating
   frequency (1.5 +/- 0.4 Hz). It is proposed that the volcano mouse
   spermatozoa possess some features very similar to other mammalian
   spermatozoa and that bicarbonate triggers caudal epididymal sperm
   motility of this species. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Experimental results concerning the statistics of the streamwise
   component of velocity in a turbulent boundary layer near a solid wall
   are presented. Energy spectra, probability density functions and
   velocity structure functions are investigated as a function of the
   distance to the wall. Energy spectra and structure functions display
   power-law scalings which depend on this distance. On the other hand, the
   relative behavior of structure functions remains constant in the
   logarithmic sublayer. This behavior exhibits two distinct power-laws. At
   small scales, relative scaling exponents are relatively close to those
   usually reported in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. At larger
   scales, where shear effects are dominant, relative exponents display
   larger intermittency corrections. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {We have constructed hydrogen saturated carbon and silicon clusters with
   only 5-atom rings to study their effect on the electronic properties of
   the corresponding amorphous materials. Using density functional theory
   and the local density approximation we calculate the electronic
   structure of pure and contaminated clusters, symmetric and nonsymmetric,
   with the impurity in the center or in the nearest neighbor position. For
   the pure cluster we find, by comparison to reference clusters with
   6-atom boat-type rings, that the pentagonal clusters have a narrower
   valence band and that the top of the valence band moves to lower
   energies. Without the hydrogen contribution the energy gap for the
   pentagonal carbon cluster is larger than that for the hexagonal one and
   the gap for both silicon clusters is practically the same, contrary to
   expectations due only to size. For the impure clusters the carbon gap
   values decrease as the atomic number of the impurity increases, whereas
   the effect is opposite for silicon; also, the width of the valence band
   is larger in all eases than that for the pure clusters.},

Abstract = {Hammerhead ribozymes previously were found in satellite RNAs from plant
   viroids and in repetitive DNA from certain species of newts and
   schistosomes. To determine if this catalytic RNA motif has a wider
   distribution, we decided to scrutinize the GenBank database for RNAs
   that contain hammerhead or hammerhead-like motifs. The search shows a
   widespread distribution of this kind of RNA motif in different sequences
   suggesting that they might have a more general role in RNA biology. The
   frequency of the hammerhead motif is half of that expected from a random
   distribution, but this fact comes From the low CpG representation in
   vertebrate sequences and the bias of the GenBank for those sequences.
   Intriguing motifs include those found in several families of repetitive
   sequences, in the satellite RNA from the carrot red leaf luteovirus, in
   plant viruses like the spinach latent virus and the elm mottle virus, in
   animal viruses like the hepatitis E virus and the caprine encephalitis
   virus, and in mRNAs such as those coding for cytochrome P450
   oxidoreductase in the rat and the hamster.},

Abstract = {From the Oligocene Los Ahuehuetes locality, near Tepexi de Rodriguez,
   Puebla, Mexico, five new plant species are described based on their leaf
   architecture. The presence of brochidodromous or acrodromous venation,
   and secondary veins forming angular (versus rounded) arcs, are well
   defined characters in the fossil material that relate it to
   Berberidaceae. Comparison with the leaves and leaflets of extant and
   fossil plants allow the recognition of one Mahonia and four Berberis is
   new species. The lack of detailed information on leaf architecture in
   Berberidaceae limits the evaluation of the taxonomic relationships that
   can be suggested between fossil and extant plants. However, from a
   biogeographic point of view the presence of these new fossil plants
   supports the hypothesis of a North American origin of the Orientalis
   Groups of Mahonia, to which a lineage of Berberis may be added.
   Furthermore, two of the new species suggest the dispersal, some time
   during the Tertiary, of a lineage that today forms the Australis Group
   of Berberis from low latitude North America to South America. The
   movement of the Chortis Block is proposed as an alternative to explain
   the dispersal of a growing list of plants from north to south in the
   Americas. Only through future geological and palaeobotanical work call
   this hypothesis be corroborated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {The effect of dietary carbohydrates (CBH) on glucose and glycogen,
   digestive enzymes, ammonia excretion and osmotic pressure and osmotic
   capacity of Litopenaeus stylirostris juveniles was studied. The increase
   of CBH, ranging between 1 and 33\%, stimulates activities of
   alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase in the hepatopancreas. High levels
   of glucose in hemolymph and of glycogen in the hepatopancreas were
   reached at the highest level of dietary CBH; however, the kinetics of
   accumulation is different. Shrimps fed with low level of CBH needed 3 h
   to reached glucose peak, whereas only 1 h is necessary for high CBH
   levels. A saturation curve was observed in glycogen level and ol-amylase
   activity with maximum values in shrimp-fed diets containing 21\% CBH.
   This level could be used to be included as a maximum shrimp dietary CBH
   level. Pre-prandial glycogen levels were observed in shrimp fed a diet
   containing 1\% CBH, indicating an important gluconeogenesis, which
   affected the protein metabolism. The present results show that a diet
   containing 10\% CBH may not be enough to cover the CBH requirement,
   which could be satisfied by dietary protein content. The low osmotic
   capacity observed in shrimp fed on a diet containing 10\% CBH coincided
   with a relatively low post-prandial nitrogen excretion which reflects a
   low concentration of amino acids circulating in hemolymph, which
   affected the osmotic pressure and the osmotic capacity. These results
   reflect the high plasticity of shrimp species to use protein to obtain
   metabolic energy from food and its limited capacity for processing
   dietary CBH. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   first few minutes following coronary occlusion, there is a gradual rise
   in the extracellular concentration of potassium ions ({[}K+](0)) within
   ischemic tissue. This elevation of {[}K+](0) is one of the main causes
   of the electrophysiological changes produced by ischemia, and has been
   implicated in inducing arrhythmias. We investigate an ionic model of a 3
   cmx3 cm sheet of normal ventricular myocardium containing an ischemic
   zone, simulated by elevating {[}K+](0) within a centrally-placed 1 cmx1
   cm area of the sheet. As {[}K+](0) is gradually raised within the
   ischemic zone from the normal value of 5.4 mM, conduction first slows
   within the ischemic zone and then, at higher {[}K+](0), an arc of block
   develops within that area. The area distal to the arc of block is
   activated in a delayed fashion by a retrogradely moving wavefront
   originating from the distal edge of the ischemic zone. With a further
   increase in {[}K+](0), the point eventually comes where a very small
   increase in {[}K+](0) (0.01 mM) results in the abrupt transition from a
   global period-1 rhythm to a global period-2 rhythm in the sheet. In the
   peripheral part of the ischemic zone and in the normal area surrounding
   it, there is an alternation of action potential duration, producing a
   2:2 response. Within the core of the ischemic zone, there is an
   alternation between an action potential and a maintained small-amplitude
   response (similar to 30 mV in height). With a further increase of
   {[}K+](0), the maintained small-amplitude response turns into a
   decrementing subthreshold response, so that there is 2:1 block in the
   central part of the ischemic zone. A still further increase of {[}K+](0)
   leads to a transition in the sheet from a global period-2 to a period-4
   rhythm, and then to period-6 and period-8 rhythms, and finally to a
   complete block of propagation within the ischemic core. When the size of
   the sheet is increased to 4 cmx4 cm (with a 2 cmx2 cm ischemic area),
   one observes essentially the same sequence of rhythms, except that the
   period-6 rhythm is not seen. Very similar sequences of rhythms are seen
   as {[}K+](0) is increased in the central region (1 or 2 cm long) of a
   thin strand of tissue (3 or 4 cm long) in which propagation is
   essentially one-dimensional and in which retrograde propagation does not
   occur. While reentrant rhythms resembling tachycardia and fibrillation
   were not encountered in the above simulations, well-known precursors to
   such rhythms (e.g., delayed activation, arcs of block, two-component
   upstrokes, retrograde activation, nascent spiral tips, alternans) were
   seen. We outline how additional modifications to the ischemic model
   might result in the emergence of reentrant rhythms following alternans.

Abstract = {The columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) was studied in lead-tin
   alloys, which were solidified directionally from a chill face. The main
   parameters analyzed include the temperature gradients, solidification
   velocities of the liquidus and solidus fronts, and grain size. The
   transition was observed to occur when the temperature gradient in the
   melt decreased to values between -0.8 degrees C/cm and 1 degrees C/cm.
   In addition, there is an increase in the velocity of the liquidus front
   faster than the solidus front, which increases the size of the mushy
   zone. The size of the equiaxed grains increases with distance from the
   transition, an observation that was independent of alloy composition.
   The comparison with available analytical models and the observations
   indicate that the transition is the result of a competition between
   coarse columnar dendrites and finer equiaxed dendrites.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Experiments were designed to investigate size-selective predation by
   medium (40-55 mm carapace width) and large (55-70 mm) Carcinus maenas
   when feeding on four bivalves of contrasting shell morphologies, mussel,
   Mytilus edulis, flat oyster Ostrea edulis, Pacific oyster Crassostrea
   gigas, and edible cockle Cerastoderma edule. Medium-sized crabs
   preferred mussels 5-15 mm shell length (maximum shell dimension) and
   cockles 5-10 mm long, whereas large crabs preferred mussels 15-25 mm and
   cockles 10-20 mm long. Generally, no preference was shown for any
   particular size of either species of oyster. Comparisons amongst the
   preferred size ranges of prey showed that crab preference for a
   particular size range of prey was more strongly related to the minimum
   than to the maximum shell dimension, and that the minimum shell
   dimension was always equivalent to, or smaller than: the maximum cross
   section of the crabs' chelae. The size ranges of M. edulis and C. edule
   selected by C. maenas either clearly corresponded to, or were slightly
   smaller than, the size ranges of prey with the highest profitability (=
   dry weight consumed per unit of handling time). Profitability values of
   M. edulis and C. edule, however, showed considerable scatter; whereas
   those of O. edulis and C. gigas were even more variable. This variation
   seems to be the result of behavioral strategies by which crabs attack
   all encountered prey but reject those that remain unbroken after a
   certain number of opening attempts. Our results emphasize the
   mechanistic nature of size-selective feeding in C. maenas, and suggest
   that the differences in the observed patterns of size-selection were
   mainly determined by the contrasting morphological features of the
   bivalve shells, and the way these features influence the vulnerability
   of prey to crab predation.},

Abstract = {Species-selective predation by medium (40-50 mm carapace width) and

   individual crabs with paired combinations of mussels Mytilus edulis,
   flat oysters Ostrea edulis, Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas, and
   cockles Cerastoderma edule in various proportions. When offered mussels
   and either oyster species simultaneously, both size categories of crabs
   consistently selected mussels, and food choice was independent of prey
   relative abundance. By contrast, C. maenas selected mussels and cockles
   as expected by the frequency in which each size category of crab
   encountered the preferred size ranges of prey. Crab preference clearly
   paralleled the rank order of prey profitability, which, in turn, was
   mainly determined by prey biomass, suggesting that active selection
   takes place at some point of the predation cycle. Decisions by crabs on
   whether to attack oysters and mussels initially were not influenced by
   the flavor or odor of their flesh. Both mussel and oyster filtrates had
   a similar reinforcing effect on crab perseverance to open prey. However,
   species-related preferences exhibited by crabs feeding at or near the
   optimal size suggest that foraging decisions are partly based on
   evaluations of over-all prey shape and volume, and that the minimum
   dimension of the shell constitutes an important feature that crabs
   recognize and associate with prey value.},

Abstract = {The ultrastructure of notochordal cells and the quantitative changes of
   nuclear mRNA-containing particles were studied in several stages of the
   development of the chick embryo. The modifications in the frequency of
   perichromatin granules (PCG) were analyzed in embryos at 24 hr to 10
   days of incubation (stages 6-36 of Hamburger and Hamilton). The
   ultrastructural and morphometric data show that notochordal cells
   undergo changes that can be systematized in four periods. Very early
   notochordal cells (stages 6-11), are characterized by the presence of
   large nucleoli and abundant PCG, traits probably related to the frequent
   mitotic division and the expression of inductive signals reported in
   numerous papers. During the second period (stages 16-21) the number of
   PCG and the size of the nucleolus decrease. These changes are coincident
   with the beginning of vacuolization. In the third period (stages 21-30),
   the notochordal cells undergo a second cytodifferentiation characterized
   by a large increase of cytoplasmic vacuolization and secretion of
   materials that thicken the perichordal sheath. During this period, the
   nucleolus becomes smaller and the number of PCG increases. Similar
   features were previously described during functional maturation of
   embryonic neurons and striated fibers at synaptogenesis, and epidermal
   cells. The fourth period, beginning at stage 30, is characterized by the
   decrease of the density of PCG and of the nucleolar volume and
   corresponds to cessation of mitosis and cell degeneration. Anat Rec

Abstract = {Paternal behavior of the volcano mouse (Neotomodon alstoni) was studied
   and its role in the care of young compared with that of the female.
   Paternal behavior of this rodent under laboratory conditions consisted
   of direct and indirect activities, such as huddling, grooming, sniffing,
   and retrieving young as well as maintenance and vigilance of the nest.
   The male volcano mouse exhibited all components of parental behavior
   displayed by mothers, except suckling. However, the male participated
   significantly more than the female in huddling, grooming, and sniffing.
   The existence of paternal behavior in this rodent suggests that under
   natural conditions this species exhibits a monogamous mating system
   because monogamy in rodents is often associated with paternal care.},

Abstract = {South American species of the freshwater copepod genus Boeckella are
   distributed in the Andean region, which corresponds to southwestern
   South America below 30 degrees south latitude, also extending along the
   Andean highlands north of this latitude, and comprises the Subantarctic,
   Central Chilean. Patagonian, and Paramo-Puna subregions. Based on a
   track analysis, five generalized tracks were found: Subantarctic
   (involving some Subantarctic islands, the Falklands, Tierra del Fuego,
   and the southern portion of continental Chile and Argentina): B.
   brevicaudata, B. poppei. B. vallentini, and and B. michaelseni:
   Patagonian (in the southern Patagonia plateau): B. brasiliensis. B.
   silvestrii vestrii. and B. longicauda; Mid-southern Andes: B. gibbosa
   and B. diamantina; Paramo-Punan (in the central and northern Andes, from
   northwestern Argentina to western Colombia): B. calcaris, B. palustris,
   and B. occidentalis; and Neotropical (mainly in the Neotropical region,
   but reaching also Patagonia and the Puna): B. meteoris and B. bergi. Two
   nodes have been determined: one in southern Chile and Argentina, where
   the Subantarctic, Patagonian, and Neotropical tracks intersect, and the
   other in the central Andes. where the Paramo-Punan and Neotropical
   tracks intersect.},

Abstract = {Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is characterized by a T-cell-mediated
   alveolitis, and the putative role of other inflammatory cells in its
   pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study we determined whether
   increased quantities of neutrophils were present in HP lungs, and if
   they were positive for gelatinase B and collagenase-2. Fifteen
   nonsmoking patients with subacute/chronic active HP were included. Lung
   samples were analyzed using myeloperoxidase antibody, and
   neutrophil/total cell ratio was evaluated by digital processing. All HP
   tissue samples exhibited variable quantities of neutrophils located
   inside vessels, and in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Lung
   neutrophil percentage ranged from 0.7\% to 4.8\% (2.1 +/- 1.4\%). There
   was a positive correlation between the percentage of lung neutrophils
   and the percentage of lung fibrosis (r = 0.6, p < 0.02). Tissue
   neutrophils showed intense immunoreactive collagenase-2 and gelatinase B
   staining. Additionally, gelatinolytic activities corresponding to
   progelatinases A and B and their activated forms, were several-fold
   increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with
   HP as compared with control subjects. These findings suggest that in HP
   lungs there is a persistent traffic of neutrophils loaded with
   gelatinase B and collagenase-2 that may play a role in the lung damage
   and in the fibrotic response.},

Abstract = {Seasonal and environmentally induced variation in the type and frequency
   of leaf trichomes of Wigandia urens (Ruiz \& Pavon) Kunth
   (Hydrophyllaceae) was studied. Depending on the microsite, W. urens
   plants had smooth leaves with glandular trichomes or bristly leaves with
   both glandular trichomes and urticant trichomes (stinging hairs).
   Trichome density (number of urticant trichomes per unit leaf area) was
   higher in the dry season than in the wet season, and was significantly
   correlated with both temperature (r = 0.353, P < 0.05) and
   photosynthetic active radiation (r = 0.313, P < 0.05). Plants
   established in sun-exposed areas had trichome densities three times
   higher than those of plants established in shaded areas during the dry
   season, and 28 times higher during the wet season. At both exposed and
   shaded sites, trichome densities of the youngest leaves of young plants
   were higher than those of the youngest leaves of mature plants. In
   smooth and bristly leaves, transpiration rates decreased with increasing
   temperature during the day. However smooth leaves had higher
   transpiration rates than bristly leaves at both exposed and shaded
   sites. In laboratory studies, trichome density was significantly (P <
   0.01) reduced when small sun-grown plants (0.20-0.30 m tall) were either
   shaded or irrigated. In larger plants, also, irrigation significantly (P
   < 0.01) reduced trichome density relative to that of unirrigated
   controls.},

Abstract = {Leaves of two new plants are reconstructed from their isolated leaflets
   collected from the Oligocene Los Ahuehuetes locality near Tepexi de
   Rodriguez in Puebla, Mexico. The leaves of Pseudosmodingium mirandae
   Ramirez-Garduno et al. are compound imparipinnate with leaflets of
   variable morphology. The leaflets of five leaf morphotypes vary from
   narrow elliptic to lanceolate or lorate; they are symmetrical to
   slightly asymmetrical, with acute to attenuate apex, acute to cuneate
   base, and entire to serrate margin. Venation is simple pinnate
   craspedodromous, with secondary veins slightly curved near their base;
   secondary veins may dichotomize near the margin to become tertiary
   veins, and intersecondary veins are small and oblique to the secondary
   veins. A small number of leaflets assigned to Pseudosmodingium
   terrazasiae Ramirez-Garduno et al. are distinguished from P. mirandae by
   the leaflet shape, length:width ratio, base shape, and apex angle.
   Morphological comparison of the fossil leaves with leaves of extant
   species of Anacardiaceae based on numerical analyses indicates a close
   similarity between P. mirandae and Pseudosmodingium multifolium Rose,
   while P. terrazasiae is more similar to Pseudosmodingium perniciosum
   (HBK) Engl. The presence of fossil species with extant relatives that
   are endemic to Mexico, along with previous reports, indicates that by
   the Oligocene, some lineages were already in place, although today they
   form part of the more xeric communities in southern North America.},

Abstract = {Eleven new salicaceous taxa based on fossil leaves, seven Salix and four
   Populus species, are described from the Oligocene Los Ahuehuetes

   teeth, camptodromous secondary venation, and elliptic or lanceolate

   those reported previously from the United States and elsewhere indicate
   that diversification among these taxa occurred early during their
   differentiation. Furthermore, the limited morphological similarities of
   the fossil and extant plants growing naturally in Mexico also indicate a
   high rate of evolution. Documenting the expansion of high-latitude North
   American taxa into lower latitudes at the time of deposition of the Pie
   de Vaca Formation confirms that at least some of the typical boreal taxa
   were part of dry tropical communities in low-latitude North America and
   underscores the need to reevaluate the origin of this southern

Abstract = {The absolute differential and total cross sections for single electron

   differential cross sections scale reasonably well, showing an overall
   increase of two orders of magnitude and three maxima at different

   section, that the electron capture channel ``opens{''} at a critical
   projectile-target separation between 2.88 a(0) and 3.15 a(0) and that at
   least two different processes are involved in the present energy range.
   The single electron capture cross section of Kr+ ions in various media
   is shown. It has been found that the dependence of the single electron

Abstract = {From the aerial parts of Decatropis bicolor, heraclenin (1), seselin
   (2), psoralen (3), imperatorin (4), skimmianine (5), and heraclenol (6),
   were isolated. This is the first time that coumarin-like compounds are
   isolated from Decatropis genus. The anti-inflammatory properties of
   compounds 1-6 were examined against the ear edema in mice produced by
   TPA, The results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of each
   compound depends of its individual substitution on the aromatic ring
   rather than the coumarin skeleton itself.},

Abstract = {Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) play a key regulatory
   role in extracellular matrix remodeling. By screening a lung library
   with a human TIMP-2 cDNA probe, we have isolated the cDNA corresponding
   to guinea pig TIMP-2. The 3.5-kb cDNA presents an open reading frame
   that predicts a protein of 220 amino acids showing 97.2, 96.8, 97.2, and
   77.3\% overall identity with human, mouse, rat, and chicken TIMP-2,
   respectively. Guinea pig TIMP-2 cDNA was expressed in CHO-K1 cells,
   showing a protein with the expected molecular weight and activity.
   Northern blot analysis revealed TIMP-2 expression in brain, kidney,
   intestine, spleen, heart, and lung. Transforming growth factor-beta
   down-regulated TIMP-2 mRNA in guinea pig lung fibroblasts, whereas a
   variety of other stimuli showed no effect. In normal and
   hyperoxia-exposed lungs, TIMP-2 mRNA was mainly localized in alveolar
   macrophages and epithelial cells. No quantitative differences were found
   by Northern blot. These results confirm that TIMP-2 is highly conserved
   in mammals and largely expressed in lungs.},

Abstract = {This work studied the effect of light-stressors, irradiance and
   photoperiod length on the status of hemolymph glutathione in two species
   of crayfish, procambarus clarkii and Procambarus digueti, Adult animals
   of each species were submitted to two experimental approaches: (1) two
   batches of each species were placed under low or high light irradiant
   conditions of light-dark (LD) 24 h cycles of two different photoperiod
   lengths, one normal LD 12: 12 and one extreme LD 20:4 low and high
   irradiance for 10 weeks. Time-dependent light changes on hemolymph
   glutathione concentration were determined throughout the entire
   experimental period; and (2) three batches of the two species were
   submitted to independent treatments consisting of the same LD 12:12
   cycles of high and low irradiance and 20:4 high-irradiance LD cycles.
   Reduced and oxidized glutathione hemolymph concentrations were
   determined and total glutathione was calculated. In addition midgut
   glutathione reductase activity in both species was determined. The two
   species showed different hemolymph glutathione reactivity and
   glutathione status for the two light parameters. Dissimilar responses of
   both species, as well as the rate of mortality of P, digueti represent
   specific differences in the metabolic responses, as well as tolerance to
   photo-oxidative stress produced by light. The role of glutathione in the
   tolerance of crayfish to photo-oxidative stress is discussed.},

Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The catalytic combustion of dry carbon monoxide and air in a planar
   stagnation-point flow over a platinum foil with external power is
   studied in this paper. The reduced heterogeneous kinetics are modelled
   with the dissociative adsorption of the molecular oxygen and the
   non-dissociative adsorption of CO, together with a surface reaction of
   the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type and the desorption reaction of the
   adsorbed product, CO2(s). The resulting governing equations have been
   numerically integrated and the whole S-shaped response curve has been
   obtained as a function of the mixture initial concentration. The
   critical conditions for the catalytic ignition and extinction are
   deduced using high activation energy asymptotics of the desorption
   kinetics of the most efficient adsorbed reactant, CO(s). We obtained a
   very good agreement between the numerical and asymptotic results for the
   ignition and extinction conditions. In general, the ignition process can
   be well modelled without reactant consumption, while extinction occurs
   in the partial diffusion-controlled regime, with a finite non-zero
   concentration of carbon monoxide close to the plate. (C) 2000 Published

Journal = {OPHELIA},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Polychaete larvae were sorted fi-om a collection of 116 zooplankton
   samples taken in 76 localities during the GOLCA 84-04 cruise in
   March-April 1984. Two morphologies were identified in the Chaetopreridae
   genus Spiochaetopterus: larval types I and II. The morphology of A4
   setae dissected from the larvae is compared with A4 setae of erected
   species from the Pacific. Larvae of Spiochaetopterus type I could belong
   to S. monroi. From local observation of adults and larvae, and
   comparison with the first species described in the genus: S. costarum,
   it appears that this species is not present in the Gulf of California.
   Although S. costarum was for a long time credited with a widespread
   distribution throughout the world because of its long planktonic larval
   development, it is now acknowledged that many reported occurrences were
   in-correctly attributed to S. costarum, and in consequence its specific
   area has been restricted ill recent years. This paper confirms that the
   setal morphology of larvae and adults is very helpful in the
   identification of planktonic larval stages.},

   junction subject to external magnetic fields within the Ginsburg-Landau
   theory. We show that the order parameter in the intergrain region
   depends crucially on the interplay of two characteristic lengths: the
   superconducting coherence length xi proportional to(1-T/T-c)(-1/2) and
   the junction-induced superconducting decoherence length
   zeta(q)proportional to(1 - T/T-c)(-alpha). Data for the transport
   critical current in granular YBCO samples are presented, and the A-B to
   G-L crossovers successfully described.},

Abstract = {A cladistic analysis based on 21 characters from the external morphology
   and male genitalia was undertaken in order to determine the status of
   the flea subgenera Ctenophthalmus (Alloctenus) and C.
   (Nearctoctenophthalmus). As a result of the analysis, Ctenophthamus
   (Alloctenus) (=Nearctoctenophthalmus, new synonym) comprises nine
   species tin phylogenetic sequence): C. psendagyrtes, C. sanborni, C.
   micropus, new status (from subspecies of C. pseudagyrtes), C. haagi, C.
   tecpin new species, C. caballeroi, C. cryptotis, C. expansus, and C.
   myodosus, new status (from subspecies of C. expansus). Biogeographic
   data indicate that two species (C. pseudagyrtes and C. micropus) are
   widespread in both the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, another (C.
   tecpin) is exclusively Nearctic, whereas the remaining six species are
   exclusively Neotropical. Within the latter, the monophyletic clade
   including those species previously assigned to C. (Alloctenus) is
   endemic to the Transvolcanic Mexican Belt. Host data indicate that the
   most primitive species are basically parasites of sigmodontine mice
   (Rodentia: Muridae)-secondarily associated with Talpidae and Soricidae
   (Insectivora)-whereas the most derived species are exclusive parasites
   of the shrew genus Cryptotis (Insectivora: Soricidae).},

Title = {Upregulation of gelatinases A and B, collagenases 1 and 2, and increased

Journal = {CHEST},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {117},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Background: A central feature in the pathogenesis of COPD is the
   inflammation coexisting with an abnormal protease/antiprotease balance.
   However, the possible role of different serine and metalloproteinases
   remains controversial.
   Patients and measurements: We examined the expression of gelatinases A
   and B (matrix metalloproteinase {[}MMP]-2 and MMP-9); collagenases 1, 2,
   and 3 (MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13); as well as the presence of apoptosis
   in lung tissues of 10 COPD patients and 5 control subjects. In addition,
   gelatinase-h and gelatinase-B activities were assessed in BAL obtained
   from eight COPD patients, and from six healthy nonsmokers and sis
   healthy smoker control subjects. Setting: Tertiary referral center and
   university laboratories of biochemistry, and lung cell kinetics.
   Results: Immunohistochemical analysis of COPD lungs showed a markedly
   increased expression of collagenases 1 and 2, and gelatinases A and B,
   while collagenase 3 was not found. Neutrophils exhibited a positive
   signal for collagenase 2 and gelatinase B, whereas collagenase 1 and
   gelatinase A were revealed mainly in macrophages and epithelial cells.
   BAL gelatin zymography showed a moderate increase of progelatinase-A
   activity and intense bands corresponding to progelatinase B, In situ end
   labeling of fragmented DNA displayed foci of positive endothelial cells,
   although some alveolar epithelial, interstitial, and inflammatory cells
   also revealed intranuclear staining.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that there is an upregulation of
   collagenase 1 and 2 and gelatinases A and B, and an increase in
   endothelial and epithelial cell death, which may contribute to the
   pathogenesis of COPD through the remodeling of airways and alveolar
   structures.},

Abstract = {Plants of the genus Valeriana produce irioid esters of biotechnological
   interest, known as valepotriates. The regeneration of Valeriana edulis
   ssp. procera via indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis from
   leaf-derived callus and suspension cultures, is presented. For induction
   of callus, leaves were cultured on semisolid MS medium supplemented with
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and kinetin. Embryogenic and
   organogenic callus development was observed after 16 weeks. Calli were
   transferred to semisolid and liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
   supplemented with kinetin and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Appearance
   of shoot and somatic embryo occurred 4 weeks later. Shoots were rooted
   and somatic embryos were germinated and were transferred to the
   greenhouse. A better organogenic and embryogenic response was observed
   from suspension cultures. Histological observations of morphogenic
   callus revealed that both somatic embryos and shoots arose from the same
   type of callus. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {The effect of salinity in survival, growth and osmotic capacity of
   juvenile Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis was determined. Survival was not
   affected by salinities from 15 to 35\% during 96 h exposure periods.
   Shrimps exposed to 5 and 10\% were noticeably affected by salinity with
   a survival of 0 and 48\% after 96 h, respectively. Lethal salinity for
   50\% of the individuals in 96 h (LS(50), 96 h) at 28 degrees C was 10\%.
   Growth rate (mg dw day (-1)) was significantly higher at higher
   salinities. The isosmotic point of early juvenile F. brasiliensis was
   794 mOSm kg(-1), at around 25 parts per thousand. Results indicate that
   F. brasiliensis has low tolerance to low saline environments, and grows
   better in salinities greater than its isosmotic point. Osmotic capacity
   seemed to be related to biological characteristics that determine the
   environmental preferences and behavior, as well as the distribution of
   this shrimp species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   uniqueness of the limit is obtained by considering it as the solution of
   an evolution equation in a greater Banach space. The main difficulties
   are due to the unboundedness of the operators appearing in the

   > T-g, where T-g is the glass transition temperature, has been widely
   reported in the literature. On one hand, it is a well-known fact that in
   the region T-g < T < T-c, fragile glass forming liquids do not follow
   the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law. On the other hand, in the same region the
   Stokes-Einstein relation between the viscosity and the translational
   diffusion coefficient breaks down. Using the temperature derivative
   analysis, we present, for three glass-forming liquids, an empirical law
   for log(10) f, where f is the frequency, and we exhibit the break down
   of the Stokes-Einstein relation. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science

Title = {High resolution detection of rRNA and rDNA in plant nucleoli with

Journal = {BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},
Year = {2000},

Abstract = {Ln the present work we perform in situ hybridization with probes to
   different stretches of rDNA and electron microscopy of nucleoli with
   different activities, to gain insight into the ultrastructural
   organization of transcription and processing in the plant nucleolus. The
   main ultrastructural nucleolar components: fibrillar centers (FC), dense
   fibrillar component (DFC), and granular component (GC), are arranged in
   different ways depending on nucleolar activity. Heterogeneous FCs
   containing RNP fibrils and nucleolar perichromatin granules are
   frequently seen in nucleoli in the process of activation. DNA-RNA in
   situ hybridization with biotinylated probes spanning different sequences
   of the rDNA unit followed by immunogold detection of biotin,
   demonstrated the localization of the ribosomal transcripts in DFC,
   mainly in the zones around the FCs, in GC, and in the periphery of pale
   FC. The internal region of the heterogeneous FCs is labeled only in
   cells in the process of activation of transcription after dormancy. The
   distribution of the U3 probe indicates that the processing of the rRNA
   takes place in the DFC and inside the heterogeneous FCs, in which
   transcription occurs. DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrates the presence of
   rDNA in the compact and extended chromatin located in the interior and
   at the periphery of I;Cs and in nucleolar associated chromatin. Our
   results support the view that the plant nucleolus has a highly dynamic
   morphological and functional organization composed of a bipartite domain
   formed by FCs surrounded by DFC, which is associated with rRNA
   transcription and processing, and the GC representing a store of
   preribosomal particles. 2000 (C) Editions scientifiques et medicales

   are reduced to a system of integro-differential equations with five
   nondimensional parameters: the Prandtl number of the condensed fluid
   Pr-c, the Jakob number Ja, the nondimensional plate thermal conductivity
   alpha, the aspect ratio of the plate epsilon, and the ratio of the
   thermal conductance of the condensed layer to the thermal conductance of
   the forced cooling how beta. The condensed-layer thickness and the
   temperature of the plates are estimated in the asymptotic limit Ja --> 0

Title = {Larval ecology of an ascidian tropical population in a Mediterranean
   enclosed ecosystem},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {159-167},
Abstract = {The larval ecology of a population of the tropical tunicate
   Ecteinascidia turbinata was studied in a semi-enclosed lagoon on the
   island of Formentera (Mediterranean Sea). Due to the lagoon's isolation
   and processes of extinction/regeneration of the population, research was
   carried out to evaluate some aspects of the species' ecology which
   permit it to survive in this habitat. Settlement and recruitment were
   found to be intimately related to the period of sexual reproduction, and
   determined by the local production of larvae. In this sense, the
   population's spawning potential (larvae m(-2)) matched a perfect linear
   relationship (R-2 = 0.9496, p < 0.05) with the settlement and
   recruitment registered on experimental settlement surfaces. Of the
   larvae produced by the population 29\% settled locally, contributing to
   the consolidation of populations already established. Only 1.3\% of the
   larval production theoretically calculated developed into colonies at a
   local level. To determine how Settlement site might contribute to the
   colonies' survival and thus to population distribution, zooids were
   transplanted from an appropriate zone to a stressful zone, which showed
   that there is a risk of inappropriate habitat selection for settlement.
   The behaviour of the larvae (philopatry) and gregarious settlement in
   unpredictable environments (spatio-temporally variable) seems
   advantageous to prevent advection to inappropriate sites. E. turbinata
   ensures local recruitment and renewal of the established population, but
   it seems that there is partial dispersal of larvae beyond the parent
   population. The study shows that there is sufficient recruitment from
   within the population to maintain it and the timing of larval production
   and recruitment strongly suggest that recruits are from the population
   itself.},

Title = {A general framework for functional networks},
Journal = {NETWORKS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-82},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce functional networks as a generalization and
   extension of the standard neural networks in the sense that every
   problem that can be solved by a neural network can also be formulated by
   a functional network. But, more importantly, we give examples of
   problems that cannot be solved using neural networks but can be
   naturally formulated using functional networks. Functional networks are
   defined as a collection of connected functional units on a set of nodes.
   A functional unit or neuron connects input nodes to output nodes. The
   values of the output nodes are calculated from the values of the input
   nodes by given functions of one or several arguments. The main
   differences with neural networks are that (a) the neural functions can
   be multivariate and can be different from neuron to neuron tin which
   case, no weights are necessary, because they subsume by the different
   functions) and (b) the neuron outputs can be coupled, that is,
   coincident. This mathematical model of functional networks parallels
   printed circuit boards with electronic components, thus giving an
   intuitive interpretation to functional networks and an interesting and
   natural additional application. The existence of functional units with
   common outputs leads to functional equations whose solution can lead to
   substantial simplification of the initial topology of the network and
   the neural functions involved. Two types of functional networks (the
   one-layer and serial functional networks) are discussed in detail. For
   the one-layer functional networks, a very simple simplification
   algorithm is given. For the serial functional networks, systems of
   functional equations are obtained. The methods are illustrated by
   several examples of applications. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Abstract = {Seventy-three species of macroalgae from the Mexican Pacific, Atlantic

   toxic, if the organism behaved abnormally but death did not occur, and
   non-toxic if the fish did not display any change. 79\% species were
   ichtyotoxic to some degree. Extracts of 39 species were toxic, with at
   least one extract with lethal effects, 19 were moderately toxic and 15
   species were non-toxic. Only the extracts of Dictyota bartayresiana,
   Dictyota cervicornis, Lobophora variegata, Bryothamnion triquetrum and
   Laurencia obtusa were toxic in all three solvents. The acetone and
   ethanol extracts were more active, and therefore are more suitable for

Abstract = {Comparisons of complete cellular genomes indicate that a set of genes
   whose products sqnthesize, degrade, or interact with RNA molecules are
   among the most highly conserved sequences common to all living beings,
   and therefore may have been present in their last common ancestor, i.e.,
   the cenancestor. In order to obtain insights on the evolution of
   sequences which may date from an early evolutionary period during which
   RNA played a genetic role prior to the emergence of DNA genomes, we have
   analyzed the conserved RNA-binding sites of these highly conserved
   molecules, since these may be some of the recognizable peptides in our
   dataset. The characteristics of some of these highly conserved amino
   acid stretches which are essential in RNA metabolism are discussed.},

Abstract = {In order to achieve improved predictions in a solidification process
   using mathematical modeling it is necessary to couple the solidification
   modeling with an accurate thermodynamic model. In the present report,
   thermodynamics aspects related to solidification of Lead Tm alloys are
   considered Such aspects are; the solidification path, the solid fraction
   vs. temperature, and the enthalpy and the latent heat evolution. A
   thermodynamic model including the above phenomena is developed and the
   values of the associated parameters are calculated, particularly the
   enthalpy of the solid and liquid phases of the alloys in the mushy zone,
   as a function of temperature and alloy concentration. From the
   calculated enthalpies, the latent heat released during solidification,
   which is a key input parameter in any solidification model, can be
   readily obtained The total integrated heat released for complete
   solidification of Lead Tin alloys calculated with the present model is
   in good agreement with reported data.},

Abstract = {A cladistic analysis of Curculionoidea based on 100 morphological
   characters (28 from larvae and 72 from adults) is presented. The 13
   terminal taxa correspond to 7 extant families of Curculionoidea of which
   the largest, Curculionidae, is represented by 7 smaller units. The
   terminal units art: defined by morphological autapomorphies taken from
   published information on larvae and adults. The chrysomeloid
   Palophaginae was used as outgroup. The cladogram shows that there is a
   basal dichotomy in the superfamily, Nemonychidae-Anthribidae being the
   monophyletic sister taxon to the remaining families, which follow the
   sequence Belidae, Attelabidae, Caridae, Brentidae, and Curculionidae.
   The units of Curculionidae are related as follows: Ithycerinae,
   Microcerinae, Brachycerinae, Ocladiinae, Dryophthorinae, Erirhininae,
   and `Curculionidae s.str.'. Important areas where further work should be
   directed are: the sister group relationship of Nemonychidae and
   Anthribidae, and the recognition of monophyletic subfamilies within the
   Curculionidae s.str, as well as the placement of Platypodinae.},

Abstract = {Lagenophrys dennisi, a peritrich ciliate, was observed attached to the
   exoskeleton of the crayfish Cambarellus patzcuarensis in lake Patzcuaro,
   Michoacan, Mexico. Lagenophrys dennisi presents a hemispheroidal,
   suboval or oval lorica in dorsal view, the distinctive lorica aperture
   consists of a pair of lips highly arched unthickened, and smooth.
   Comparison of morphometric characters of the ciliate with previous
   records is made. Structures such as a ``V{''}-shaped lorica suture,
   collar ridges, and myoneme are proposed for species identification. An
   anterior crescentic thickening on the dorsal surface of the lorica was
   observed under the scanning electron microscope. lagenophryids were
   associated with 11 of 13 body parts with antennules and rostrum showing
   the highest prevalence. lagenophrys dennisi was also found attached to
   submerged glass slides. This study represents the first record of L.
   dennisi on C. patzcuarensis and the first record of its presence in
   Mexico.},

Journal = {INTERCIENCIA},

Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-47},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The Italian botanist Leon Croizat (1894-1982) is a controversial figure
   in the most recent history of biogeography. Based on the metaphor that
   ``life and earth evolve together{''} -which means that geographic
   barriers and biotas coevolve- Croizat developed a new biogeographic
   methodology, which he named `panbiogeography `. This method was
   basically to plot distributions of organisms on maps and connect the
   disjunct distribution areas or collection localities together with lines
   called tracks. Croizat found that individual tracks for unrelated groups
   of organisms were repetitive, and considered the resulting summary lines
   as generalized tracks which indicated the preexistence of ancestral
   biotas, subsequently fragmented by tectonic and/or climatic changes.
   Some authors, mainly those belonging to the dispersalist establishment,
   have dismissed Croizat's contributions, considering him as
   idiosyncratic, or a member of a lunatic fringe. Others have considered
   Croizat as one of the most original thinkers of modern comparative
   biology, whose contributions advanced the foundations of a new synthesis
   between earth and life sciences. Following its synthesis with
   phylogenetic systematics, Croizat's panbiogeography has emerged as being
   central to vicariance or cladistic biogeography. In spite of this
   synthesis, some authors currently agree in the distinction between
   Croizat's panbiogeography and cladistic biogeography.},

Abstract = {The variation of moisture content and germinability in response to light
   conditions and natural dry and controlled dry conditions was studied in
   Sicyos deppei G. Don (Cucurbitaceae) seeds and compared with germination
   of seeds from green and black fruits collected directly from field
   plants. The increase of germi nation by scarification defines hard
   seeds. The green and black scarified fruits were non-photoblastic. The
   non-scarified seeds from black fruits were indifferent to light but
   those from green fruits were positive photoblastic. This response may be
   due to the ratio Pfr/Pr in the seeds. Green fruits with 82\% water
   content were tagged to follow natural desiccation for 5, 7 and 9 days at
   75\% RH and others were subjected to 8\% RH controlled environment, over
   saturated urea solution, for the same number of days. Water content of
   seeds maintained under natural conditions decreased slowly, from 82\% to
   77\% in 9 days, but no difference in germination percentage was found.
   In seeds stored under controlled conditions, the water content decreased
   from 79\% to 11\% in 9 days and germination increased from 34\% to 46\%.
   This was related to the induction of a state of tolerance by quick and
   drastic dry conditions.},

Abstract = {Adenine is one of the four principle bases of nucleic acid, the
   essential molecule of life and evolution. Apparently, only one
   configuration of adenine exists in nature giving it unique chemical and
   biological properties. Using a force field type potential model with
   parameters fitted to the nucleic acid bases, proteins and other
   biological molecules (involving the sum of the contributions from bond
   stretching, bond angle bending, torsional angle twisting, and Coulomb
   and Lennard-Jones terms) we searched the potential energy surface for
   other stable isomers of adenine. The search was performed using a
   genetic algorithm, an efficient and global technique, The most
   interesting of the lowest energy minima found in the global search were
   relaxed using quantum-mechanical, semiempirical (PM3), and first
   principles (Hartree-Fock; and density functional theory) methods, These
   calculations gave similar geometries and energy ordering for the new
   structures. This work formed part of a larger project to study the
   binding of nanoclusters of gold to segments of nucleic acid for possible
   application in the emerging field of nanoelectronics, The results could
   also have implications in mutation and transcription of DNA. (C) 1999

Title = {Quercus rugosa seedling dynamics in relation to its re-introduction in a
   disturbed Mexican landscape},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-200},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {. In order to define the regeneration niche and then promote the
   re-introduction of Quercus rugosa into a disturbed area we studied seed
   predation, germination, seedling survival and growth of this species at
   three different sites: the forest interior, the forest border and a
   disturbed site, along a disturbance gradient. Acorn removal on the
   ground was high at the sites, with higher removal rates from 25-seed
   clusters than from 5- and 1-seed clusters. More seeds were removed at
   the forest border than at the other two sites, although in all cases
   some seeds remained in the soil for periods long enough for them to
   germinate and produce seedlings. Seed germination and seedling
   establishment were more successful and similar in the forest interior
   and the forest border, and much less successful at the disturbed site,
   due to acorn desiccation. Seedling survival was strongly affected by
   site, with the highest survival at the forest border and the lowest
   survival at the disturbed site after a year. The subsequent dry season,
   which was particularly harsh, caused a drop in survival both at the
   forest border and the disturbed site. In the former, a closer analysis
   revealed that partially shaded microsites enhanced survival, while in
   the latter overall survival was very low, with approximately 5 \% of the
   seedlings surviving, compared to 50 \% final survival at the other
   sites. There was a positive correlation between seed size and seedling
   survival at the forest border. The three size variables measured
   (seedling height, basal diameter and crown area) did not increase
   noticeably during the 20-month study period at the forest interior,
   while growth still occurred at the forest border and the disturbed site.
   However, during the two dry seasons there were large drops in mean
   seedling height and crown area at the disturbed site, due to more
   frequent dieback, causing large variation in seedling size. These
   results show that extensive re-introduction of this species to the
   disturbed area will probably fail under present conditions, and that
   careful selection or duplication of microsites that mimic the partial
   shade of the forest border is a sound method for improving oak
   establishment at this site.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {This paper studies the expected total cost (ETC) criterion for
   discrete-time Markov control processes on Borel spaces, and possibly
   unbounded cost-per-stage functions. It presents optimality results which
   include conditions for a control policy to be ETC-optimal and for the
   ETC-value function to be a solution of the dynamic programming equation.
   Conditions are also given for the ETC-value function to be the limit of
   the alpha-discounted cost value function as alpha up arrow 1, and for
   the Markov control process to be `stable' in the sense of Lagrange and
   almost surely. In addition, transient control models are fully analized.
   The paper thus provides a fairly complete, up-dated, survey-like
   presentation of the ETC criterion for Markov control processes on Borel
   spaces.},

Abstract = {The catalytic ignition of dry carbon monoxide and air in a planar

   adsorption of the molecular oxygen and the nondissociative adsorption of
   CO, together with a surface reaction of the Langmiur-Hinshelwood type
   and the desorption reaction of the adsorbed product, CO2(s). The
   critical conditions for the catalytic ignition are deduced using high
   activation energy asymptotics of the desorption kinetics of the most
   efficient adsorbed reactant, CO(s). When using the appropriate
   activation energy of the desorption reaction of CO(s), the ignition
   temperature obtained in closed form compares very well with experimental
   results. (C) 1999 by The Combustion Institute.},

   L819-L828, 1995]. The cultured human fibroblast strains most active in
   producing the apoptotic activity contained high numbers of stellate
   cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin, a myofibroblast marker. The
   apoptotic activity eluted from gel-filtration columns only in fractions
   corresponding to proteins. Western blotting of the protein fraction
   identified immunoreactive angiotensinogen (ANGEN), and two-step RT-PCR
   revealed expression of ANGEN by HIPF fibroblasts but not by normal human
   lung fibroblasts. Specific ELISA detected angiotensin II (ANG II) at
   concentrations sixfold higher in HIPF-conditioned medium than in normal
   fibroblast-conditioned medium. Pretreatment of the concentrated medium
   with purified renin plus purified angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
   further increased the ELISA-detectable ANG II eightfold. Apoptosis of
   AECs in response to HIPF-conditioned medium was completely abrogated by
   the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin (50 mu g/ml) or anti-ANG II
   antibodies. These results identify the protein inducers of AEC apoptosis
   produced by HIPF fibroblasts as ANGEN and its derivative ANG II. They
   also suggest a mechanism for AEC death adjacent to HIPF myofibroblasts

Abstract = {Understanding evolution of geographic variation in sexually dimorphic
   traits is critical for understanding the role that sexual selection may
   play in speciation. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of geographic
   variation in sexual dichromatism in the Yarrow's spiny lizard
   (Sceloporus jarrovii), a taxon that exhibits remarkable diversity in
   male coloration among populations (e.g., black, red, green, yellow,
   blue, brown). An mtDNA phylogeny based on approximately 880 bp from the
   12S ribosomal RNA gene and 890 bp from the ND4 gene was reconstructed
   for 30 populations of S. jarrovii and eight other species of the
   torquatus species group using maximum-likelihood and parsimony methods.
   The phylogeny suggests that S. jarrovii consists of at least five
   evolutionary species, none of which are sister taxa. Although
   intraspecific diversity in male coloration is less than indicated by
   previous taxonomy, two species formerly referred to as S. jarrovii
   exhibit impressive geographic variation in sexual dichromatism. In one
   of these species, the phylogeny shows the independent evolution of a
   distinctive blue color morph in different parts of the species range.
   This pattern suggests that sexual selection may lead to striking
   phenotypic divergence among conspecific populations and striking
   convergence. Results also demonstrate the importance of a phylogenetic
   perspective in studies of evolutionary processes within nominal species
   and the problematic nature of ``polytypic{''} species recognized under
   the biological species concept.},

Abstract = {The present study analyzes the morphological aspects of the cerebellum
   of rats with prenatal exposure to ozone. A double blind histological and
   planimetric analysis was performed studying sagittal sections of the
   anterior cerebellar lobe at postnatal days 0, 12 and 60. Ozone exposed
   rats showed cerebellar necrotic signs at age 0, diminished area of the
   molecular layer with Purkinje cells with pale nucleoli and perinucleolar
   bodies at age 12, and Purkinje cells showing nuclei with unusual clumps
   of chromatin in the periphery at age 60. We conclude that exposure to
   high concentrations of ozone during gestation induces permanent
   cerebellar damage in rats. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {The seagrasses are one of the most important organic substrates for the
   establishment of a diversity of epibiotic organisms. To date most of the
   literature on epiphytes living on seagrasses deals with an immense
   diversity of algae and sessile invertebrates. However, studies
   of:epibiotic microorganisms such as protozoan ciliates are scarce. The
   goal of this paper is to provide a list of sessile ciliate composition,
   their frequency, density and distribution on Thalassia testudinum shoots
   in a coral reef lagoon. The study site was a T. testudinum community in
   Isla Verde, a coral reef in Veracruz, Mexico, during August, October
   1994 and May 1995. In the laboratory, the ciliates were identified using
   light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and conventional staining
   techniques. The two way ANOVA (Model 1) was used to compare the
   difference between densities of sessile ciliates in relation to the
   different parts of the seagrass (basal parr of the leaves and foliage)
   and the sampling periods, Twenty-eight species were identified,
   belonging in the following groups: folliculinids (7), licnophorid(1),
   stichotrich (1), prostomatid(1) suctorians (6) and peritrichs (12). Nine
   species are new records for Mexico. The most frequent species on T.
   testudinum:basal part of the leaves were: Lagotia expansa f. depressa,
   Metafolliculina andrewsi:si, Parafolliculina tristanensis, Metacystis
   truncata, Acineta tuberosa, Cothurnia aplatita, C. ceramicola, C.
   maritima and on foliage were Parafolliculina amphora and Vorticella
   campanula. Only two species were found on the rhizomes Chaetospira
   mulleri and Cothurnia maritima. Maximum species richness was observed on
   the basal part of the leaves, where the densities of other epiphytes
   were low or absent. The difference in densities of the sessile ciliates
   are interpreted as the interaction of the sampling periods and the
   different parts of the seagrass studied. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {This paper describes an improvement of England and Mattheij's code
   MUTSSYM for solving linear Boundary-Value Problems for Ordinary

   The method is based on Multiple Shooting with a Decoupling strategy,
   allowing the calculation of stable solutions according to the increasing
   or decreasing fundamental modes.
   The integration of the associated Initial-Value Problems is performed
   using a 4(th)-order symmetric implicit Runge-Kutta method with the
   Dichotomic Stability property. If the problem is well conditioned, the
   method calculates discrete decaying (growing) modes controlled by
   initial (terminal) conditions corresponding to similar continuous modes.
   A special step-size control strategy permits efficient calculation of
   the numerical solution throughout the interval. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   of Mexican cloud forests, in order to postulate a preliminary hypothesis
   of relationships. The single cladogram obtained grouped the twenty-four
   cloud forests into five clades. These results indicate that the Sierra

Abstract = {In regard to the problem of determining minimum L-J configurations for
   clusters of n atoms, we present here a genetic algorithm able to
   reproduce all best-known solutions in the 13 < n < 147 size range. These
   include not only the classical structures adhering to the
   icosahedral-growth, but also seven icosahedral structures with
   incomplete core, six more following the Marks decahedron geometry, and
   the unique (n = 38) face-centered cubic configuration that has been
   found in this range. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated developmental circadian changes in the
   content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in two structures proposed to
   contain pacemakers in crayfish Procambarus clarkii: the cerebral
   ganglion and the eyestalks. Crayfish (N=260) from three developmental
   stages were divided into two groups: (1) animals subjected to 12 h:12 h
   light:dark cycles for 10 days and (2) animals treated as described
   above, then exposed to 72 h of continuous dim light. Crayfish from both
   groups were killed at different times of day, and the cerebral ganglion
   and the eyestalks of each were assayed for 5-HT by reversed-phase HPLC
   with electrochemical detection. In all stages of development, 5-HT
   content (expressed as 1 wet mass tissue) showed circadian variations in
   both structures analyzed; rhythms continued to free-run under constant
   illumination, and total 5-HT content was higher in the brain
   (0.581+/-0.36 mu g g(-1); mean +/- S.E.M.) than in the eyestalks
   (0.299+/-0.15 mu g g(-1)). As development advances, the percentage of
   the rhythm that shows periods of 24 h diminishes, while the percentage
   of the rhythm that shows periods of 9 to 12 h increases. This seems to
   indicate that pulsatile variations in 5-HT content are superimposed in a
   circadian component. The relationship between the 5-HT rhythm and
   electroretinogram and motor activity rhythms during development is
   discussed.},

Pages = {424-431},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The heterotrophic theory of the origin of life is the only proposal
   available with experimental support. This comes from the ease of
   prebiotic synthesis under strongly reducing conditions. The prebiotic
   synthesis of organic compounds by reduction of CO2 to monomers used by
   the first organisms would also be considered an heterotrophic origin.
   Autotrophy means that the first organisms biosynthesized their cell
   constituents as well as assembling them. Prebiotic synthetic pathways
   are all different from the biosynthetic pathways of the last common
   ancestor (LCA). The steps leading to the origin of the metabolic
   pathways are closer to prebiotic chemistry than to those in the LCA.
   There may have been different biosynthetic routes between the prebiotic
   and the LCAs that played an early role in metabolism but have
   disappeared from extant organisms. The semienzymatic theory of the
   origin of metabolism proposed here is similar to the Horowitz hypothesis
   but includes the use of compounds leaking from preexisting pathways as
   well as prebiotic compounds from the environment.},

Abstract = {Members of the genus Denisiella are very small globoid Collembola, with
   only six species previously described from all over the world
   (Palacios-Vargas, 1995).
   They are very interesting because they display well differentiated
   sexual dimorphism, mainly in the antennae of the male and some other
   small characteristics as the type of setae.
   Most of them measure less than one milimeter, are difficult to collect
   and few specimens are obtained from Berlese funnel samples. After the
   study of some Mexican specimens we have discovered new species from
   Nayarit State, and, though only females were located it is possible to
   provide a description, as several features of its morphology are unique.},

Abstract = {The catalytic ignition of a gaseous combustible mixture in a planar
   stagnation-point flow is studied. The heterogeneous reaction mechanism
   is modelled by two dissociative adsorption-desorption reactions for both
   reactants, a surface reaction of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type and the
   desorption reaction of the adsorbed product. Using asymptotic techniques
   based on the large activation energy of the desorption of the most
   efficient adsorbed reactant, the critical conditions for ignition are
   obtained in closed form, showing the full parametric dependence on this
   critical process. A direct comparison with the global one-step surface
   reaction shows that the reaction order of the most efficient adsorbed
   reactant has to be negative with its value depending on the dissociative
   adsorption of the reactant. The overall activation energy also depends
   strongly on the dissociative character of the adsorption processes of
   both reactants.},

Abstract = {Multiscale correlation functions in high Reynolds number experimental
   turbulence, numerical simulations, and synthetic signals are
   investigated. Fusion Rules predictions as they arise from
   multiplicative, almost uncorrelated, random processes for the energy
   cascade are tested. Leading and subleading contribution, in the inertial
   range, can be explained as arising from a multiplicative random process
   for the energy transfer mechanisms. Two different predictions for
   correlations involving dissipative observable are also briefly
   discussed. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {According to its supporters, some of the possible consequences of the
   meaningful learning theory of physical concepts are a better
   understanding and a longer retention of them in the memory of the
   student, superior to those achieved by other forms of learning. The
   exposure to the maximum discrimination between a physical concept and
   its preconcepts is one of the relevant variables in the process of
   meaningful learning of that concept by the student. Consequently, it is
   necessary to define as precisely as possible the physical object under
   consideration (consisting of concepts, axioms, mathematical apparatus,
   deduced laws and experimental behavior) in order to produce an
   appropriate contrast with the preconcepts of the pupils. The main
   contention of the present writing is that the epistemological
   construction of the physical object (detailed below) is the procedure
   which produces one of the neatest descriptions of the physical theory
   and its scientific concepts to be taught in the classroom. The following
   text details the epistemological construction at the undergraduated
   level of three physical objects in thermodynamics, newtonian and
   einsteinian mechanics, respectively. They will possibly help the teacher
   of the subject to integrate a collection of physical objects to be
   contrasted with the corresponding ``preobjects{''} of the student.},

Abstract = {The steady state heat transfer characteristics of a thin facing-up strip
   with internal heat generation is studied in this work. The
   nondimensional temperature distribution in the strip is obtained as a
   function of the following parameters: (a) the intensity and distribution
   of the internal heat sources, (b) the aspect ratio of the strip, (c) the
   longitudinal heat conductance of the strip and (d) the Prandtl number of
   the fluid. Both the thermally thin and the thick wall approximations are
   considered in this paper. The total thermal energy or averaged
   temperature of the strip is found to decrease, as the influence of the
   longitudinal heat conduction effects in the strip decreases, in the
   thermally thin wall regime. After reaching a minimum, it increases again
   in the thermally thick wall regime.},

Abstract = {The CD-1 male-mouse model was employed to evaluate comparatively the
   toxicity of four vastatins (VTS) currently used in clinical medicine:
   lovastatin (LVT), simvastatin (SVT), pravastatin (PVT) and fluvastatin
   (FVT). Each vastatin was used orally in doses of 500 mg/Kg body
   weight/day, in animals with a hypercholesterolemic diet (HD) 5 days, or
   with a control diet (CD) 30 days. The association of high doses of VTS +
   HD produced a significant increase in liver weight and liver weight to
   body weight ratio in animals with SVT and FVT. Cholesterol (Chol) and
   triacylglycerols (TAG) in the liver increased significantly with FVT but
   not with the other VTS; Chol increased and TAG decreased in serum very
   significantly with FVT and SVT. The serum aminotransferases increased
   quite significantly with FVT but not with other VTS. In the experiment
   with high doses of VTS + CD, the animals receiving SVT or FVT showed a
   moderate loss of body weight. Liver weight and liver weight to body
   weight ratios were similar among all groups. Liver Chol showed a
   significant decrease with all VTS. Serum Chol decreased moderately with
   LVT and FVT. TAG in serum and liver showed a moderate decrease with all
   VTS. The serum aminotransferase's were not modified by any vastatin. Our
   results indicate that high doses of VTS in male mice with a
   hypercholesterolemic diet result in a decreasing toxicity as follows:
   FVT>SVT>LVT>PVT.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},

Abstract = {Analyses of mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region sequences from 175
   leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea from 10 nesting colonies
   revealed shallow phylogenetic structuring of maternal lineages on a
   global scale. Eleven haplotypes were observed, and mean estimated
   sequence divergence, p = 0.00581, is much lower than the deepest nodes
   reported in global mtDNA surveys of the green turtle Chelonia mydas,
   loggerhead Caretta caretta, and ridley turtles Lepidochelys spp. The
   leatherback turtle is the product of an evolutionary trajectory
   originating at least 100 million years ago, yet the intraspecific
   phylogeny recorded in mitochondrial lineages may trace back less than
   900000 years. The gene genealogy and global distribution of mtDNA
   haplotypes indicate that leatherbacks may have radiated from a narrow
   refugium, possibly in the Indian-Pacific during the early Pleistocene
   glaciation. Analysis of haplotype frequencies revealed that nesting
   populations are strongly subdivided globally (F-ST = 0.415), and within
   ocean basins (F-ST = 0.203-0.253), despite the leatherback's highly
   migratory nature. Within the Atlantic significant differences in
   haplotype frequency distributions and Nm Values <2 are observed in
   pairwise comparisons between St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) and
   mainland Caribbean populations, and between Trinidad and the same
   mainland populations. These findings provisionally support the natal
   homing hypothesis for leatherback turtles, although several proximal
   nesting populations were indistinguishable, suggesting recent
   colonization or less precise natal homing behaviour than documented for
   other marine turtle species. The evidence of natal homing, manifested on
   ecological time scales, may be erased in some populations by rapid
   rookery turnover resulting from climatic fluctuation and the ephemeral
   nature of nesting habitat on a geological time scale. The evolutionary
   effective population size (N-e) is estimated from mtDNA data to be
   between 45 000 and 60 000, a value that exceeds current global census
   estimates of 26 000 to 43 000 adult females.},

Journal = {PHYSICS OF FLUIDS},

Volume = {11},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {Turbulence is triggered by an air flow passing around a cylinder and
   heated by an array of hot wires parallel to the cylinder axis.
   Simultaneous velocity and passive temperature fluctuations are measured
   locally on the centerline of the cylinder wake. The focus is on the
   scaling properties of the mixed scalar-velocity structure functions
   {[}\textbackslash{} delta u(r) delta theta(r)(2)\textbackslash{}(p/3)].
   It is observed that {[}\textbackslash{} delta u(r) delta
   theta(r)(2)\textbackslash{}(p/3)] displays the same scaling behavior as
   {[}\textbackslash{} delta u(r) delta
   theta(r)(2)\textbackslash{}]Psi(p)/Psi(3) over an extended range of
   scales. This yields accurate measurements for the relative scaling
   exponents Psi(p)/Psi(3). It is further observed that the moments of the
   coarse-grained scalar energy diffusion rate {[}N(r)(p)] satisfy a
   closure condition as proposed by She and Leveque {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 72,
   336 (1994)]. Otherwise it is Proposed that {[}\textbackslash{} delta
   u(r)delta theta(r)(2)\textbackslash{}(p/3)] scales as
   {[}N(r)(p/3)]{[}\textbackslash{} delta u(r)delta
   theta(r)(2)\textbackslash{}](p/3). This generalized similarity relation
   is well supported by our measurements over a range of scales which
   greatly exceeds the inertial range. A theoretical prediction is finally
   proposed, Psi(p) = p/9 + (10/9) (1 - (2/5)(p/3)), in good agreement with
   our experimental data. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics,

Abstract = {GRB 990123 was a long, complex gamma-ray burst with an optical transient
   that started early within the gamma-ray phase. The peak and power-law
   decay of the early optical emission strongly indicate the presence of a
   decelerating relativistic shell during that phase. Prior to this burst,
   it was not known if the shell decelerated during the burst, so an
   external shock origin for the gamma rays was still possible. If the
   gamma rays are produced in the external shock, then the pulse widths
   should reflect the observed deceleration of the shell and increase by a
   factor between 1.25 and 2.3, depending on the angular extent of the
   shell. We analyze the fine time structure observed in the gamma-ray data
   from BATSE and determine that the width of the peaks does not increase
   as expected for a decelerating shell; the later pulses are only 1.034
   +/- 0.035 longer than the earlier pulses. The lack of pulse width
   evolution eliminates the only remaining kinematically acceptable
   external shock explanation for the gamma-ray phase and, thus, the gamma
   rays must originate at a central engine.},

Abstract = {Cytochemical staining (EDTA procedure for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and
   osmium ammine staining), immunocytochemistry (mAbs anti DNA and
   trimethyl guanosine cap), hypotonic-formaldehyde fixation and in situ
   hybridization have been used to study the macromolecular architecture of
   the interphase nucleus of meristematic cells of a dicotyledon plant with
   chromocentric nuclei, Chirantodendron pentadactylon. The perichromatin
   region contains extended chromatin loops, perichromatin fibrils as well
   as typical and immature perichromatin granules. Hypotonic fixation
   combined with immunolocalization of trimethyl guanosine cap showed that
   perichromatin fibrils are associated with snURNPs. These results
   indicate that in the perichromatin region the splicing of newly
   synthesized pre-mRNA is taking place. Thus, the same functions are
   localized in the perichromatin region of plant and animal cell nuclei.
   RNA-containing granules morphologically similar to perichromatin
   granules, but significantly smaller in size, were found in the
   interchromatin region. These granules are frequently grouped in
   clusters. Filaments of extended chromatin pervade the interchromatin
   region. These observations show that these structures correspond to
   Lacandonia granules, previously found in some monocotyledons with
   reticulate nucleus, but not observed in dicotyledons with a
   chromocentric nucleus. The presence of these granules in both
   monocotyledons and dicotyledons suggests that they probably constitute
   an ancestral character of angiosperms. Perichromatin and Lacandonia
   granules pediculate and irregular in shape corresponding to immature
   forms are described for the first time in the nucleus of plants.
   Immunolocalization indicates that the snURNPs are associated with
   fibrils, interchromatin granules, coiled bodies and nucleolus associated
   bodies (NABs). Taken as whole these features demonstrate that intense
   transcription and splicing occur in the ample interchromatin region of
   meristematic nuclei of Chirantodendron pentadactylon. (C) Elsevier,

Abstract = {We briefly review a simple statistical model of a boson-fermion mixture
   of unpaired fermions plus linear-dispersion-relation Cooper pairs that
   leads to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for all dimensions greater
   than unity. (The ``dispersion relation{''} of a particle is its energy
   vs. momentum relation.) This contrasts sharply with ``ordinary{''} BEC
   for a many-boson assembly of non-interacting bosons each moving in
   vacuum with a quadratic dispersion relation, which is well-known to
   occur only for dimensions greater than two. The BEC critical
   temperatures T-c are substantially higher than those of the BCS theory
   of superconductivity, for the same BCS model interaction between the
   fermions that gives rise to the Cooper pairs, at both weak and strong
   couplings. However, these results hold with an ideal-fermi-gas (IFG)
   density-of-states (DOS) for the underlying electron (or hole) carriers.
   We then show that even higher T-c values are obtained in 2D if a non-IFG
   DOS is employed which reflects the electronic band structure of the
   quasi-2D copper-oxygen planes characteristic of cuprate superconductors.
   The non-IFG DOS used are both a so-called Van Hove scenario (VHS) with a
   logarithmic singularity in the DOS, and a DOS with a
   power-law-singularity associated with an extended-saddle-point (ESP) in
   the energy-momentum curve.},

Abstract = {Mesoscopic diffusion in the ballistic regime has long been recognized to
   be described by the non-local Landauer diffusion coefficient: D =
   cLT/(2R). This is an incoherent result because, in its derivation, the
   quantum interference between incident and scattered waves has been
   neglected. This raises the question as to whether or not it may be
   derived from a purely classical theory such as Boltzmann's transport
   equation. We prove that the answer is positive. We show that in spite of
   the fact that the Boltzmann and the incoherent quantum theory are
   described by different diffusive stochastic processes and have different
   local diffusion coefficients, they give the same algebraic expression
   (the Landauer result) for the non-local diffusion coefficient. (C) 1999

Abstract = {The availability of a number of complete cellular genome sequences
   allows the development of organisms' classification, taking into account
   their genome content, the loss or acquisition of genes, and overall gene
   similarities as signatures of common ancestry. On the basis of
   correspondence analysis and hierarchical classification methods, a
   methodological Framework is introduced here for the classification of
   the available 20 completely sequenced genomes and partial information
   For Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Homo sapiens, and Mus musculus. The
   outcome of such an analysis leads to a classification of genomes that we
   call a genomic tree. Although these trees are phenograms, they carry
   with them strong phylogenetic signatures and are remarkably similar to
   16S-like rRNA-based phylogenies. Our results suggest that duplication
   and deletion events that took place through evolutionary time were
   globally similar in related organisms. The genomic trees presented here
   place the Archaea in the proximity of the Bacteria when the whole gene
   content of each organism is considered, and when ancestral gene
   duplications are eliminated. Genomic trees represent an additional
   approach for the understanding of evolution at the genomic level and may
   contribute to the proper assessment of the evolutionary relationships
   between extant species.},

Abstract = {Inflorescences of Tradescantia clone 4430 were exposed to different
   concentrations of radon (Rn) gas (0.85, 12.10, 36.50 and 98.16 kBq/m(3))
   from plants placed in an acrylic chamber that received radon from a
   container with pitchblende (containing uranium mineral). The exposure
   time was 24 h, afterwards the plants were left for 6 h in water and
   constantly aerated. Positive control plants were irradiated with gamma
   rays (0.8 Gy) and negative control plants received ambient air only (the
   background measurement had a mean of 0.38 kBq/m(3)). Micronuclei (MCN)
   in the tetrads induced by a particles emitted from Rn were tabulated and
   a linear concentration response was obtained. The potency of radon to
   induce MCN from the slope of the regression line was 0.13 MCN/kBq/m(3)
   of alpha-radiation. Radon could reach the anthers by diffusion through
   the aerial spaces within the buds. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), a prototype member of the
   heparin-binding growth factor family, influences proliferation,
   differentiation, and protein synthesis in different cell types. However,
   its possible role on lung extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism has not
   been evaluated. In this study we examined the effects of FGF-1 and FGF-1
   plus heparin on type I collagen, collagen-binding stress protein HSP47,
   interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase {[}MMP]-1),
   gelatinase A, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and
   TIMP-2 expression by normal human lung fibroblasts. Heparin was used
   because it enhances the biologic activities of FGF-1. Fibroblasts were
   exposed either to 20 ng/ml FGF-1 plus 100 mu g/ml heparin for 48 h or to
   FGF-1 or heparin alone. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was analyzed by
   Northern blot. Collagen synthesis was evaluated by digestion of
   {[}H-3]collagen with bacterial collagenase, MMP-1 by Western blot, and
   gelatinolytic activities by zymography. Our results show that FGF-1
   induced collagenase mRNA expression, which was strongly enhanced when
   FGF-1 was used with heparin. Likewise, both FGF-1 and FGF-1 plus heparin
   reduced by 70 to 80\% the expression of type I collagen transcript, in
   part through effect on pro-alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA stability. A
   downregulation of HSP47 gene expression was also observed. Synthesis of
   collagen and collagenase proteins paralleled gene expression results.
   FGF-1 activities were abolished with genistein, a tyrosine kinase
   inhibitor. Neither FGF-1 nor FGF-1 plus heparin affected the expression
   of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and gelatinase A. These findings demonstrate that
   FGF-1, mostly in the presence of heparin, upregulates collagenase and
   downregulates type I collagen expression that might have a protective
   role in avoiding collagen accumulation during lung ECM remodeling.},

Abstract = {1. The effect of body size on the assortative mating and reproductive
   behaviour of the univoltine grasshopper Sphenarium purpurascens
   (Charpentier) was studied in Central Mexico.
   2. Assortative mating by size was observed in the field. Evidence of
   positive assortative mating in relation to body size was found in
   laboratory experiments. Female fecundity and male success in contests
   were also correlated with body size.
   3. Larger females had a higher number of eggs per pod. Larger males
   usually won fights and were able to take over females from other males,
   and to resist takeovers by other males while guarding.
   4. Individuals of both sexes were observed copulating with more than one
   sexual partner in the field, suggesting polygamy. Male-male contests
   determined access to females, and males exhibited a postcopulatory
   prolonged mate-guarding behaviour lasting up to 18 days.
   5. In a 2-year study, sex ratio was male-biased at the beginning of the
   reproductive season and decreased to 1:1 by the end of the season,
   suggesting that the population is protandrous.
   6. The results of this study indicate that assortative mating results
   from male-male competition and female availability, and suggests that
   body size is a potential target of natural and sexual selection.},

Abstract = {A novel realization of the classical SU(2) algebra is introduced for the
   Dirac relativistic hydrogen atom defining a set of operators that allow
   the factorization of the problem. An extra phase is needed as a new
   variable in order to define the algebra. We take advantage of the
   operators to solve the Dirac equation using algebraic methods. A similar
   path to the one used in the angular momentum case is used; hence, the
   radial eigenfunctions so calculated comprise nonunitary representations
   of the algebra. One of the interesting properties of such nonunitary
   representations is that they are not labeled by integer nor by
   half-integer numbers, as occurs in the usual angular momentum
   representation. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics.

Year = {1999},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {The present study was done to establish the lethal salinity (LC50) and
   the effects of an abrupt change in the salinity on the oxygen
   consumption and the growth of postlarvae (PL10-PL21) of Litopenaeus
   setiferus, and their integration as assimilated energy. Postlarvae of L,
   setiferus presented a mean LC50 at 8 parts per thousand, and a time of
   response of 2 h. Thereafter, LC50 remained constant for the next 96 h.
   The effect of salinity on oxygen consumption and growth rate changed
   with the age of postlarvae. From PL10 to PL15, the highest oxygen
   consumption was obtained at 10 parts per thousand and the lowest ar:40
   parts per thousand. During this time, growth rate increased with
   salinity with the maximum value in 40 parts per thousand and lowest at
   10 parts per thousand. From PL15 to PL21, the highest oxygen consumption
   was obtained at 30 and 40 parts per thousand. In 30 and 40 parts per
   thousand, the growth rate was lower than that observed in animals
   maintained in 10 parts per thousand. The assimilation-salinity
   relationship changed with the age of the organisms. From PLIO to PL15,
   assimilated energy increased with a decrease in the salinity, and from
   PL15 to PL21, assimilation increased directly with an increase in the
   salinity. The inverse relationship between oxygen consumption and growth
   has been observed in other estuarine organisms and suggests that, when
   animals are found in an osmotically favorable medium, the processes of
   capture and distribution of the ingested energy are more efficient.
   These mechanisms change with age. From PL15 to PL21, an increase in the
   salinity produced an increase in the assimilation This was a result of
   an increase in the respiratory efficiency and, as a consequence, a
   reduction of the net growth efficiency.},

Title = {Morphology and photosynthesis of Caulerpa (Chlorophyta) in

Abstract = {Morphological and photosynthetic performance were analyzed in species of
   the genus Caulerpa from an exposed coral reef and a sheltered reef
   lagoon, Morphological characters, such as distance between modules,
   number of modules, stolen branches and rhizoid clusters per centimeter
   of stolen, indicated a uniformity among species within a specific
   habitat. ``Guerilla,{''} or diffusive, growth forms were characteristic
   for lagoon species and ``phalanx,{''} or compact, growth forms for reef
   species. Differences in photosynthesis were found between Caulerpa
   species. Sun-tolerant species were found on the reef, and both sun- and
   shade-tolerant species were present in the lagoon, In the lagoon,
   shade-tolerant species, such as C, lanuginosa J, Agardh, were found
   growing in the understory, and sun-tolerant species, such as C.
   paspaloides (Bory) Greville, formed the canopy, C, cupressoides (West in
   Vahl) C, Agardh was the only species found in both environments; it
   showed higher photosynthetic rates and a compressed morphology when
   growing on the reef and lower photosynthetic rates and expanded
   morphology for lagoonal ramets, These results suggest that C,
   cupressoides possesses a broad phenotypic ability to acclimate to
   lagoonal and reef settings in comparison to other Caulerpa species,
   enhancing its ecological success in this particular system.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Analysis of geographic concentrations of endemic taxa is often used to
   determine priorities for conservation action; nevertheless, assumptions
   inherent in the taxonomic authority list used as the basis for analysis
   are not always considered. We analyzed foci of avian endemism in Mexico
   under two alternate species concepts. Under the biological species
   concept, 101 bird species are endemic to Mexico and are concentrated in
   the mountains of the western and southern portions of the country. Under
   the phylogenetic species concept, however, total endemic species rises
   to 249, which are concentrated in the mountains and lowlands of western
   Mexico. Twenty-four narrow endemic biological species are concentrated
   on offshore islands, but 97 narrow endemic phylogenetic species show a
   concentration in the Transvolcanic Belt of the mainland and on several
   offshore islands. Our study demonstrates that conservation priorities
   based on concentrations of endemic taxa depend critically on the
   particular taxonomic authority employed and that biodiversity
   evaluations need to be developed in collaboration or consultation with
   practicing systematic specialists.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {103},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {A new method (adaptive smoothness functional) to produce convex and
   smooth grids over general plane regions has been introduced in a recent
   work by the authors {[}10]; this method belongs to the variational grid
   generation approach. Theoretical results showing that a convex grid over
   a region is obtained when this method is applied, were presented; the
   basic assumption was that at least one convex grid exists. A procedure
   to control large cells (bilateral smoothness functional), in addition to
   smoothness and convexity, was also presented. Experimental results,
   showing the effectiveness of these methods, were reported; however, no
   theoretical results were reported assuring that the area control can be
   always exerted. This article continues the same line of research,
   introducing a new version of the bilateral smoothness functional that
   improves the control of large areas. Unlike the former method,
   theoretical results show the effectiveness of the new bilateral
   smoothness functional to exert such control. Optimal grids obtained with
   the new functional are compared with those reached using the older
   version, demostrating the improvement. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The white shrimp Penaeus setiferus is a potential species for culture in
   the Gulf of Mexico. It has been demonstrated that postlarval P.
   setiferus is a species sensitive to ammonia and nitrite. in this study,
   the effect of ammonia and nitrite on the oxygen consumption of Penaeus
   setiferus postlarvae subjected to different dissolved oxygen
   concentrations was investigated. Un-ionized ammonia tended to reduce the
   oxygen consumption of P. setiferus postlarvae. The addition of 0.4 mg/L
   un-ionized ammonia-N modified the response of the postlarvae to lower
   dissolved oxygen levels. Exposure to 0.7 mg/L un-ionized ammonia-N
   caused severe effects on the respiratory rate and it was lethal at low
   dissolved oxygen concentrations. Nitrite exposure decreased the
   respiratory rate of post-larvae in high dissolved oxygen concentrations,
   whereas postlarvae exposed to nitrite under hypoxic conditions showed
   higher oxygen consumption than unexposed animals. The decreases of the
   oxygen consumption induced by the interactive effect of ammonia or
   nitrite and low dissolved oxygen concentration indicate a harmful
   condition. The results indicate that P. setiferus postlarvae is a
   sensitive organism to the combined effect of un-ionized ammonia or

Year = {1999},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal biology of the
   Mexican lizards Sceloporus aeneus and Sceloporus bicanthalis
   (Phrynosomatidae). Sceloporus aeneus is oviparous, and has an elevation
   range of approximately 2400-3000 m. It is replaced at elevations above
   3000 m by its viviparous sister species, S, bicanthalis, whose
   elevational range extends to at least 4250 m. Selected body temperatures
   (T-sel) were measured on a laboratory thermal gradient. Mean selected
   body temperatures of S. aeneus and S. bicanthalis were 35.5 and 34.9 C,
   respectively. T-sel's for these two high elevation species were thus
   similar to T-sel of low elevation Sceloporus, an observation that
   supports the static view of the thermal physiology of Sceloporus
   lizards. For neither species did selected body temperature vary as a
   function of sex or reproductive status of females. Body temperatures
   during activity in the field were not related to the time of year or the
   reproductive status of females, although male S, bicanthalis at one site
   had higher body temperatures than females. The mean daily maximum air
   temperature declined from 22 C at the S, aeneus site at 2800 m, to 19 C
   at the S, bicanthalis site at 3200 m, and to 8 C at the S. bicanthalis
   site at 4100 m. Mean body temperatures at these sites were 32, 32, and
   29 C, respectively. These species were thus active at body temperatures
   lower than their ``preferred{''} body temperatures, presumably because
   of increasingly limited thermal opportunities at high elevations.},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {55-62},

Abstract = {The cell cycle is regulated, at least partially, by protein
   phosphorylation, activity that is carried out by a series of
   calcium-independent protein kinases among which the p34(cdc2) kinase
   plays a preponderant role. The behaviour of p34(cdc2)-like protein
   kinase(s) has been followed during germination of maize in the presence
   or absence of the synthetic cytokinin benzyladenine (BA). Whereas there
   is an increase in p34(cdc2)-like kinase(s) activity at 15h of
   germination in the presence of BA, coinciding with a peak of
   Ca2+-independent kinase activity, the amount of either the transcript
   for p34(cdc2) Or of the corresponding protein(s) does not show much
   variation during the 0-24 h period of germination studied, whether the
   phytohormone is present or not. Benzyladenine stimulates the cell cycle
   and promotes an early mitosis during maize germination. We have found
   evidence that BA promotes the movement of the p34(cdc2)-like protein(s)
   to nuclei several hours before this takes place during germination of
   control seeds, and this may constitute part of the mechanism by which
   the phytohormone promotes cytokinesis in plants.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the asymptotic and numerical analysis for the
   steady-state transpiration cooling of a thin porous flat plate in a
   laminar hot convective flow, taking into account the streamwise heat
   conduction through the plate. For high conductivity plates, a regular
   perturbation analysis has been carried out, yielding a three-term
   asymptotic solution for the distribution of plate temperature. In the
   limit of a very poorly conducting plate, a singular perturbation
   technique, based on matched asymptotic expansions, is employed to solve
   the governing equations. We also solved the equations numerically using
   a quasilinearization technique. The numerical results are in good
   agreement with the asymptotic solution close to the asymptotic limits
   studied. (C) Elsevier, Paris.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},
Year = {1999},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The changes in the number of perichromatin granules (PCG) and the
   alterations in the RNA content of the interchromatin and perichromatin
   regions caused by ovariectomy and estradiol injection were studied in
   rat endometrial fibroblast and myometrial muscle cells. Twelve rats were
   divided in four groups. A group of rats was fixed without any treatment,
   the other three groups were ovariectomized and processed 21 days after
   the operation. One of them was studied without further treatment, and
   two groups were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mu g of 17
   beta-estradiol hemisuccinate and fixed 0.5 and 2 h after the injection.
   The frequency of PCG was evaluated in preparations stained with EDTA
   procedure preferential for RNP. The alterations of RNA content were
   estimated by post-embedding high resolution in situ hybridization using
   a total DNA probe labeled with biotinilated nucleotides revealed by
   streptavidin coupled with 10 nm gold grains. Most of the non-nucleolar
   labeling is associated to RNP containing fibrils. Perichromatin and
   interchromatin granules are labeled to a lesser extent. Castration
   brings about a reduction of the number of PCG and of the numerical
   density of labeling in endometrial fibroblasts. The injection of
   estradiol causes a rapid increase in both parameters. On the contrary,
   the frequency of PCG and intensity of labeling of epithelial endometrial
   cells and in muscle cells increase after ovariectomy and are reduced by
   estradiol administration. These results suggest that estradiol may
   affect differentially various types of target cells in the same organ,
   and also that PCG are not the only nuclear compartment of pre-mRNA or
   mRNA altered by the changes in estradiol, the RNP containing fibrils
   located in the perichromatin and in the interchromatin regions are also
   involved. (C) Elsevier, Paris.},

Abstract = {Females of the Mexican viviparous lizard Sceloporus palaciosi ovulate in
   the Fall and give birth the following spring. Histological analysis of
   the corpus luteum during the seven-month gestation period shows three
   stages of development. The first stage begins immediately after
   ovulation in early October: the ruptured follicle is irregular;
   granulosa cells invade the follicular cavity and two layers; the theca
   interna and externa surround the luteal cell mass. This stage
   corresponds to embryonic developmental stages I-Ill, During the second
   stage, the granulosa cells differentiate into luteal tissue, forming the
   corpus luteum proper. This stage begins at the end of October and
   coincides dth stages 11-29 of embryonic development. The third stage
   begins at the end of December, corresponding with stages 30-40. The
   corpus luteum degenerates rapidly during a short one-month interval,
   suggesting that the later stages of gestation are controlled by
   secretions other than those from the corpus luteum, such as from the
   adrenal glands, atretic Follicles, or the placenta.},

   littoralis (Nash) Hitchc. in three dune microhabitats at Fl Morro de la
   Mancha, southeastern Mexico: a mobile, a semi-mobile, and a stabilized
   site. We followed the growth of 15 genets at each site for two
   consecutive years and found that daughter-tussock formation was more
   frequent in the stabilized than in the semi-mobile or the mobile sites.
   Individual tussocks had a higher number of tillers in the mobile site
   than in the other two. Tiller production occurred within parental
   tussocks in the mobile site and in the form of daughter tussocks in the
   stabilized site. Reciprocal transplants suggested that phenotypic
   plasticity was responsible for the differences observed. Fertilization
   enhanced tiller production within parental tussocks but did not affect
   daughter tussock formation. Clearing experiments resulted in enhanced
   tiller production within tussocks. In these experiments,
   daughter-tussock production did not occur directionally towards
   nutrient-rich microsites. It appears that S. scoparium tillers are
   spaced at longer distances when resources are scarce and intraclonal

   increases with the energy of the incident beam and the temperature of
   the TL peak. The possible effect on the results of alternative glow
   curve deconvolutions has been studied, finding only minor differences in
   the supralinearity functions for individual peaks. Measurements for

Abstract = {In {[}1] we gave a procedure that associates to each graph Gamma a
   configuration C(Gamma) of symplectic type. We called this graph ``a
   diagram for the configuration{''}. In the same paper we prove that
   certain Dynkin-like diagrams (see Example 3 below) define the reduced
   symplectic configurations Sp(2m,2),O+(2m, 2) and O-(2m,2).
   In this note, using Hall's classification given in {[}2], we give
   diagrams for all symplectic type configurations (Theorem 1 and Remark),
   As an application we give a characterization of the universal
   representation for C(Gamma) and prove that our procedure defines the
   universal representation of C(Gamma).},

Title = {Track analysis reveals the composite nature of the Andean biota},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-130},
Abstract = {The Andean subregion corresponds to south-western South America below 30
   degrees S latitude, extending through the Andean highlands north of this
   latitude, and comprises five provinces: Subantarctic, Central Chilean,
   Patagonian, Puna and Paramo. Based on a track analysis of the Andean
   biota, three main types of distributions were found: (1) no relationship
   of the Andean subregion with other areas (Andean endemic distributions);
   (2) relationships with one area or subregion, namely (a) Austral, (b)
   Tropical and (c) Amphitropical distributions; and (3) relationships with
   more than one subregion (cosmopolitan distributions). These
   relationships were described and mapped as individual tracks, based on
   data from plans and animal taxa. Coinciding individual tracks constitute
   generalised tracks, which follow three basic patterns: Andean endemic,
   Austral and Tropical. The first pattern is represented by three
   generalised tracks, namely (a) along the Puna, Central Chilean,
   Subantarctic and Patagonian provinces; (b) along the Central Chilean,
   Patagonian and Subantarctic provinces; and (c) in the Subantarctic and
   Patagonian provinces. The second pattern (Austral) is represented by two
   generalised tracks: (a) along the Subantarctic province of South
   America, south-eastern Australia, and New Zealand and (b) along the
   Subantarctic province and New Zealand. The third pattern (Tropical) is
   based on three generalised tracks joining (a) all the Andean subregion
   with the Neotropical subregion; (b) Paramo and Puna provinces, and the
   Neotropical subregion; and (c) Patagonian province and Neotropical
   subregion. The Austral pattern reflects the existence of an ancient
   Austral biota, with Gondwana events likely to have played a major role
   in its evolution, whereas the origin of the Neotropical pattern is
   probably linked to a more recent history, especially the uplift of the
   Andes and further glaciations. Both of these patterns reveal that the
   biota of the Andean subregion has a complex or hybrid origin where two
   different ancestral biological and geological worlds met and combined.
   The Puna, Patagonian, and Subantarctic provinces appear as
   panbiogeographic nodes, because of the numerous tracks that cross them,
   probably due to complex geological events. It is possible that the
   patterns analysed are the consequence not only of vicariant events
   promoted by tectonic phenomena, but also of dispersal and/or extinctions
   that have concealed these events.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {28},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2119-2140},
Abstract = {We consider likelihood and Bayesian inferences for seemingly unrelated
   (linear) regressions for the joint multivariate t-error (e.g. Zellner,
   1976) and the independent t-error (e.g. Maronna, 1976) models. For
   likelihood inference; the scale matrix and the shape parameter for the
   joint t-error model cannot be consistently estimated because of the lack
   of adequate information to identify the latter. The joint t-error model
   also yields the same MLEs for the regression coefficients and the scale
   matrix as for the independent normal error model, which are not robust
   against outliers. Further, linear hypotheses with respect to the
   regression coefficients Also give rise to the same null distributions as
   for the independent. normal error model, though the MLE has a non-normal
   limiting distribution. In contrast to the striking similarities between
   the joint terror and the independent normal error models, the
   independent t-error model yields MLEs that are robust against outliers.
   Since the MLE of the shape parameter reflects the tails of the data
   distributions, this model extends the independent normal error model for
   modeling data distributions with relatively thicker tails. These
   differences are also discussed with respect to the posterior and
   predictive distributions for Bayesian inference.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Pulmonary emphysema refers to a lung disorder characterized by a diffuse
   destruction of the alveolar walls resulting in enlargement of the distal
   airspaces. The disease is usually a chronic, progressive, and disabling
   disorder. The concept of proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance evolved
   from the identification of patients with alpha 1-antytripsin deficiency,
   and from the development of experimental emphysematous lesions using
   different enzymes. For a long time, this concept was seen as an
   elastase/antielastase imbalance, with the consequent degradation of
   elastin. Recent evidence, however, suggests that an intricate process of
   pulmonary remodeling occurs during the development of emphysema, where a
   complex network of serine proteases and metalloproteinases capable of
   degrading different extracellular matrix molecules, primarily, but not
   exclusively fibrillar collagens and elastin, are implicated in the
   pathogenesis of this disease.},

Abstract = {We discuss a simple model that applies to a random array of arbitrarily
   shaped grains, contained between rigid vertical walls, that predicts
   arching. That is, the pressure (or weight) of the column of grains
   saturates as its height increases. The average behavior of the model is
   solved through a discrete and a continuum analysis. We find a
   qualitative agreement, with Janssen's phenomenological result for
   arching. The saturating pressure grows with N-2, where N is the
   horizontal size of the system. Adjusting our numerical results to
   Janssen's model we find a relaxation depth that also grows with N-2. The
   results of the average behavior allow us to measure fluctuations; the
   relative fluctuation of the pressure goes to zero as N-1/2 The continuum
   analysis shows that the weight inside the column satisfies a diffusion
   equation with a source term and particular boundary conditions which
   leads to a complete solution. The first-order approximation is similar
   to Janssen's result.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships in Gomphaceae sensu late were investigated.
   This has been a taxonomically difficult group of macroscopic fungi
   because of their heterogeneous external morphology, despite similarities
   in their microscopic features. Thirty-nine morphological characters wee
   studied in nineteen species from ten genera. Five additional taxa
   represented the outgroups. A monophyletic group is circumscribed to
   include the genera Gomphus, Gloeocantharellus, Kavinia, Beenakia,
   Ramaricium, Ramaria and Lentaria. This monophyletic group is supported
   by a homoplasic synapomorphy (presence of mycelial cords). This clade
   was consistent under different combinations of outgroups and different
   character weightings and was assigned a family level. We propose the
   order Gomphales to include four families: Gomphaceae, Beenakiaceae,
   Ramariaceae and Lentariaceae. There is no resolution regarding which
   genus among potential outgroups is the sister group of the seven genera.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Courtship and mating behavior of Brachypelma klaasi, heretofore unknown,
   is described on the basis of three courtship and mating sequences, one
   in captivity and two in the field. Adult males perform courtship
   movements (pedipalp drumming, leg drumming, push-up and shaking) when
   they locate a female's burrow, probably in order to avoid female
   aggression. After some physical contact, the female raises the prosoma
   and extends her chelicerae. The male then grasps her chelicerae with his
   tibial apophyses and the female arches her body backwards leaving the
   epigynum exposed. The male starts boxing the female's sternum and
   presumably inserts his pedipalps and inseminates the female. In two
   cases the female vigorously attacked the male immediately after mating
   and probably would have killed him had observers not intervened; the
   other pair separated more slowly and peacefully. Males appear to use
   chemical and/or tactile cues from the female's silk around the burrow
   during short-range searching behavior. Males begin courtship behavior by
   drumming on the silk to signal to the female that he is present. One
   male of B. klaasi observed in the held laid silk over the female's silk
   around the burrow, possibly to prevent subsequent matings by other
   males. A second male did not detect the burrow after this act.},

Abstract = {We have studied the electronic and vibrational properties of the C-60

   independent electron model with a central Morse potential corrected by
   splitting the spherical degeneracy by properly including the icosahedral
   symmetry given rise to the LUMO and HOMO states. The vibrational spectra
   is obtained by solving the corresponding secular equation using a
   Born-Mayer type potential with two parameters adjusted to Raman and IR
   spectra. The results of our model are compared with some of the best ab
   initio calculations, phenomenological models and experimental data. We
   found in general a good agreement for the vibrational spectrum
   particularly for the high frequency part. Since in our model contains
   only two parameters we are not able to reproduce accurately the whole
   spectra. The main contribution of this model is its simplicity to
   extract most of the gross features of the C-60 molecule without
   cumbersome computation.},

   differentiation. Cucurbita ficifolia did not show these differences in
   root morphology. Scanning and electron microscope observations showed
   that treated roots of both P. vulgaris and C. ficifolia had
   ultrastructural alterations of certain organelles, the plasma membrane,
   and cell walls. Root cap cells of treated roots showed amorphous and

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate possible changes in serotonin
   (5-HT) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)-like immunoreactivity related to
   time of day in Procambarus clarkii retina during the first developmental
   stages. Forty-five animals from postembryonic instars (PO1, PO2) to
   juvenile stage were kept under LD 12:12 cycles. All animals were
   anesthetized and decapitated at three times of day, 08:00, 15:00 and
   20:00 h. Isolated eyestalks were processed by immunohistochemical
   methods. The 5-HT-like immunoreactive area of retina was measured using
   computer-based image analysis. Results indicated 5-HT-like
   immunoreactive differences among the three crayfish instars studied. In
   PO1 animals, ANOVA revealed no significant differences in 5-HT-like
   immunoreactivity in the retina at different times of day. PO2 instars as
   well as juvenile instars, showed statistically significant retinal
   5-HT-like immunoreactivity changes related to time of day. Preliminary
   results indicated that TPH-like immunoreactivity was located only in the
   tapetal and retinal cells, and it was related to time of day. These
   changes suggest a diurnal cyclic regulation in the synthesis of 5-HT in
   the retina.},

Title = {Evolution of viviparity in the lizard genus Sceloporus},
Journal = {HERPETOLOGICA},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-532},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {According to the cold-climate model, viviparity in squamate reptiles
   evolves at high elevations and latitudes. The lizard genus Sceloporus
   has been used to support this model; viviparous species are found at
   higher elevations than oviparous species. For example, in the scalaris
   species group, a viviparous species replaces its oviparous sister
   species at elevations above 3000 m. We used recent literature to
   evaluate four aspects of the evolution of viviparity within the genus
   and concluded that (1) viviparity has evolved a minimum of four times
   within the genus. (2) Viviparity has not evolved at high latitudes,
   because the oviparous species found at high latitudes lack the
   morphological and physiological features that facilitate prolonged egg
   retention, the intermediate stage between oviparity and viviparity. (3)
   Viviparous species have not invaded high latitudes because viviparity in
   Sceloporus is associated with gestation during winter months. This is a
   viable reproductive mode at high elevations at tropical latitudes,
   because ambient temperatures during the winter are similar to those in
   the summer. At high latitudes, in contrast, winters may be too cold to
   support embryogenesis, or perhaps even survival of embryos. (4)
   Viviparity evolved from oviparity through three major transitions. The
   first was the evolution of viviparity from oviparity; this transition
   was associated with the invasion of high elevations. The second
   transition was a shift from summer to winter gestation such that birth
   was shifted from autumn to spring. With birth in the spring, neonates
   are able to mature by autumn, and consequently they can produce a litter
   within a year of their own birth. The third transition was a shift from
   asynchronous reproductive cycles of males and females (mating in spring
   and fertilization in autumn) to synchronous reproductive cycles (mating
   and fertilization in the autumn).},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the effect of water temperature on
   male reproductive tract degenerative syndrome (MRTDS) and male
   reproductive system melanization (MRSM) in Penaeus setiferus, and to
   evaluate the effect of water temperature on spermatophore regeneration
   time and sperm quality in electrically ejaculated adult males. Variation
   in sperm quality, gonadosomatic index, and histological changes in the
   reproductive system were used to assess reproductive tract changes in
   the first experiment. Sperm quality and regeneration time were measured
   before and after successive regenerations in the second experiment.
   Sperm quality was stable when shrimp were held at 26 C for 30 d but was
   reduced when shrimp were held at 30 C. Reproductive tissues of 20\% of
   the shrimp held at 30 C were melanized to some degree but tissue
   melanization was found in only 2.5\% of the shrimp held at 26 C.
   Spermatophore regeneration time was also affected by temperature.
   Average times for first spermatophore regeneration were 192 h at 25 C,
   152 h at 30 C, and 144 h at 33 C. Sperm quality of regenerated shrimp
   was not affected at 25 C but was reduced for regenerated animals held at
   33 C. Based on these results, we recommend a water temperature between
   25 and 27 C to obtain adequate spermatophore regeneration and to
   maintain healthy male P. setiferus broodstock for at least 30 d.},

Abstract = {A new locality named El Pelillal (Cerro del Pueblo Formation, Late
   Cretaceous, Campanian) in the southeastern area of the State of
   Coahuila, Mexico yields an assemblage of vertebrates that is important
   for correlation due to its frequent occurrence in other localities along
   the Cerro del Pueblo Formation outcrops. It is located in the Municipio
   de Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila. Among the vertebrates found are: fishes
   (Lepisosteidae; Amiidae {[}cf. Melvius sp.]); turtles (Trionychidae,
   Chelydridae {[}cf. Protochelydra sp.], Kinosternoidea {[}cf. Hoplochelys
   sp.], an undetermined kinosternoid genus, and ?Pleurosternidae
   {[}Compsemys victa]); Crocodilians Neosuchia (Goniopholididae); and
   Eusuchia and a pterosaur (Pterodactyloidea). Dinosaurs found include a
   hadrosaurine hadrosaur, a new Troodontidae, and other indeterminate
   theropods. The Fl Pelillal Locality is interpreted as a freshwater
   environment possibly influenced by tides. The fauna of the Fl Pelillal
   locality, Cerro del Pueblo Formation, resembles southern U.S.
   Campanian-Maastrichtian faunas but lacks the prevalence of baenid,
   adocid, Basilemys and Nanhsuingchelyd turtles.},

Abstract = {Udotea flabellum (Ellis et Solander) Lamouroux (Halimedales,
   Chlorophyta) is a coenocytic alga, common in many tropical marine
   waters, growing anchored in sand or attached to dead coral. To date,
   there have been no biomechanical studies of tropical sand-dwelling
   algae. We report the results of a biomechanical investigation on the
   forces necessary to detach U. flabellum, whether these forces exceed
   those required to break this seaweed, and what water velocities are
   necessary to either break or detach sand-dwelling individuals. When
   pulled in situ, 94\% of thalli of Udotea flabellum from the lagoon came
   out of the sand as entire plants; this required a force of 8.6 +/- 0.81
   Newtons (N) (mean +/- SE). In the laboratory, 19.2 +/- 1.10 N are
   required to break these individuals. We calculated the coefficient of
   drag (= C-d) as 0.2 at water velocities of 1.5 m s(-1), quickly dropping
   to 0.02 at 3 m s(-1). Calculations show that for a blade of average
   surface area (0.00108 m(2)) a C-d of 0.20 requires a water velocity of
   9-10 m s(-1) to remove U.flabellum from the substratum; with a C-d of
   0.02, water velocities in excess of 15 m s(-1) are required. Thus,
   assuming drag force is the primary hydrodynamic force experienced by U.
   flabellum, changes in C-d ensure that water-generated forces sufficient
   to remove individuals of Udotea from the substratum are rarely
   encountered. However, such forces might be present during tropical
   storms and hurricanes.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted to study the effect of protein level on the
   growth rate, survival, pre- and postprandial oxygen consumption, and
   ammonia (N-NH3) excretion in white shrimp, Penaeus setiferus (L.),
   juveniles. Diets containing 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\% and 50\% protein were
   provided at a proportion of 15\% of the dry weight of shrimp weighing
   0.19 +/- 0.01 g. The instantaneous growth rate was recorded for 45 days.
   The optimum protein level, in terms of the best growth rate, was that of
   the 30\% protein diet (1.15 g 45 days(-1)). All shrimp fed with the
   diets had significantly higher respiration rates after feeding because
   of the apparent heat increment (AHI), A greater postprandial nitrogen
   excretion (PPNE) excretion was also observed after feeding, Shrimp
   maintained on the 30\% protein diet had the lowest AHI and PPNE
   coefficients (percentage of ingested energy), and took the least time to
   reach the oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion peak. The O:N ratios
   varied according to protein level, with higher values (32 and 44,
   fasting and feeding, respectively) with a 30\% protein diet, and lower
   values (10 and 13, fasting and feeding, respectively) with 10\% and 50\%
   protein diets. These results indicate that P. setiferus juveniles use
   protein when fed with high (50\%) and low (10\%) protein diets, and
   lipid-protein substrates with a 30\% protein diet, Under these
   conditions, P. setiferus grow better with a 30\% protein diet where
   shrimp use food more efficiently.},

Abstract = {Primary human lung fibroblasts were separated into small (group I),
   intermediate (group II), and large (group III) subpopulations by unit
   gravity sedimentation (1 G). The three subsets retained differences in
   cell size for up to 15 days of primary culture. Flow cytometric
   (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) measurements of forward-angle light
   scatter agreed well with fibroblast volume measured by image analysis
   and confirmed the utility of forward-angle light scatter for
   discriminating size subpopulations. Group II fibroblasts accumulated
   most rapidly by 8 days of culture and also contained the greatest
   proportion of S and G(2)/M phase cells as determined by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Fibroblasts that were immunoreactive
   with antibodies to alpha r-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were found
   only in group III. In situ end labeling of fragmented DNA detected
   apoptotic cells in both groups II and III, but double labeling for in
   situ end labeling and alpha-SMA revealed apoptotic cells in both the
   alpha-SMA-positive and -negative populations. These results demonstrate
   that primary human lung fibroblasts behave as predicted by classic
   models of cell cycle progression and differentiation However, they do
   not support the hypothesis that the expression of alpha-actin is related
   to apoptosis. We also describe a simple and reproducible method for the
   high-yield isolation of human lung fibroblast subsets of differing
   proliferative potential and phenotype.},

Abstract = {Vertebrate coprolites (153 samples) in association with vertebrate and
   plant remains in the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) sediments of the Cerro
   del Pueblo Formation, in southeastern Coahuila, Mexico, represent at
   least ten morphotypes, ranging from ca. 1 cm to 3 cm. At least one
   suggests a carnivore origin due to the presence of abundant bone
   fragments, but most of the coprolite morphotypes were produced by either
   omnivores or herbivores. Analysis of inclusions of the coprolites
   revealed plant remains, such as stems and isolated vascular elements,
   and papillate and non-papillate cuticles. Two seed types have been
   recognized within two coprolite morphotypes. The first one has
   lythraceous affinity, being comparable to members of a morphological
   complex within Nesaeeae. The second seed type, which shows adaptations
   for water dispersal, belongs to Ranunculaceae, and is described as
   Eocaltha zoophila gen. et sp. nov. Although Eocaltha evolved a mechanism
   for abiotic dispersal, the seeds were apparently occasionally ingested
   by a vertebrate. The presence of seeds of E. zoophila in a coprolite
   suggests that the organism that produced it was looking for a
   high-quality diet perhaps represented by the seeds, and served
   indirectly as a biotic seed dispersal agent. The combination of abiotic
   and biotic dispersal syndromes, plus the fact that the seeds appear to
   be scarified suggest a case of diffuse coevolution. Interactions, as
   herbivory, during the Cretaceous prompted biotic dispersal of angiosperm
   diaspores as revealed by the presence of seeds of E, zooyhila. (C) 1998

Abstract = {The growth of nine multipurpose woody legumes was evaluated in nursery
   conditions. These species, belonging to the genera Acacia, Leucaena,
   Lysiloma, Prosopis and Pithecellobium, inhabit both primary and
   secondary tropical deciduous and thorn forests. The total length of the
   experiments was 165 days. At a variable frequency, the following four
   variables were measured: (1) relative growth rate (RGR), (2) root/shoot
   ratio (R/S), (3) root length/root dry weight ratio (RL/RDW), and (4)
   stem length (SL). The temporal behavior of these variables differed
   greatly among species. A direct relationship between seed weight and
   initial biomass production was initially found; however, the effect of
   seed size on biomass production was lost as plants aged. At the initial
   harvest, RGR values did not differ significantly among species, but they
   did at the end of the experiment; Pithecellobium dulce had the lowest
   final RGR. The three Acacia species had the highest biomass productions
   and highest R/S ratios but the lowest RL/RDW ratios; A. farnesiana and
   Lysiloma divaricata had the largest mean SL, whereas the smallest mean
   SL corresponded to the two Leucaena species and to Lysiloma
   acapulcensis. Several recommendations concerning the management of
   plants in the nursery and the optimal timing for transplanting the
   seedlings to reforestation sites are provided. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A database of more than 100 histidine biosynthetic genes from different
   organisms belonging to the three primary domains has been analyzed,
   including those found in the now completely sequenced genomes of
   Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Synechocystis sp.,
   Methanococcus jannaschii, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ubiquity of
   his genes suggests that it is a highly conserved pathway that was
   probably already present in the last common ancestor of all extant life.
   The chromosomal distribution of the his genes shows that the
   enterobacterial histidine operon structure is not the only possible
   organization, and that there is a diversity of gene arrays for the his
   pathway. Analysis of the available sequences shows that gene fusions
   (like those involved in the origin of the Escherichia coli and
   Salmonella typhimurium hisIE and hisB gene structures) are not
   universal. In contrast, the elongation event that led to the extant hisA
   gene from two homologous ancestral modules, as well as the subsequent
   paralogous duplication that originated hisF, appear to be irreversible
   and are conserved in all known organisms. The available evidence
   supports the hypothesis that histidine biosynthesis was assembled by a
   gene recruitment process.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out to investigate the non-parametric effect of
   white light on the activity rhythm of the postembryonic stages of
   crayfish and to elucidate the characteristics and development of its
   entrainment mechanisms. Forty-five postembryonical instars of crayfish
   Procambarus clarkii, separated into three groups according to age and
   moult, were investigated. They were individually monitored with a motor
   activity recording system in constant photic conditions. For the three
   groups of animals, three trials with different skeleton photoperiod (SP)
   imitating LD 8:16, LD 12:12 and LD 20:4 were conducted, each followed by
   exposure to a period of constant darkness (DD). The locomotor activity
   rhythm and its entrainment ability were evaluated.-all ages showed a
   circadian rhythm with a capability to synchronize to the different SP
   increasing with age. The three groups of crayfish analysed were
   generally synchronized by the dusk pulse, clustering the onset of
   activity close to the light pulses considered as dusk. The results
   presented in this study suggest the involvement of extraretinal pathways
   in the non-parametric entrainment of crayfish.},

Abstract = {The spatial evolution of South American Syncarida (Anaspidacea and
   Bathynellacea) and related taxa is evaluated applying a panbiogeographic
   approach, where Ocean basins are used to identify major patterns of
   intercontinental distribution. The Pacific basin, corresponding to a
   southern temperate track, is identified as the major evolutionary centre
   for Stygocaris (Stygocarididae), Bathynella (Bathynellidae),
   Atopobathynella, and Chilibathynella (Parabathynellidae), whereas
   distribution of Nannobathynella (Bathynellidae) and Cteniobathynella
   (Parabathynellidae) is centred on the Atlantic Ocean, belonging to a
   northern tropical track. It is concluded that the biotic origin of the
   South American Syncarida is complex, implying the existence of at least
   two ancestral biotas. (C) 1998 The Norwegian Academy of Science and

Abstract = {We study in this paper the influence of the aspect ratio of an

   ratio, the spreading rate is proportional to the cube of the aspect
   ratio as stated by Tanner's law. However, as the value of the aspect
   ratio increases, the proportionality constant shows a weak dependence on
   the aspect ratio, first decreasing and then increasing after reaching a
   minimum. Due to the fact that the aspect ratio of the drop decreases
   with time in the spreading drop, its influence decreases as time
   increases. {[}S1063-651X(98)09109-0].},

Abstract = {We study in this paper the time evolution of the spreading process of a
   small drop in contact with a flat dry surface, using asymptotic
   techniques. We reduced the problem by solving a quasisteady self-similar
   macroscopic problem and matched with the precursor region solution,
   where the van der Waals forces are important. A final nonlinear
   third-order ordinary differential equation has been solved numerically
   using shooting methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta techniques.
   We obtained how the capillary number changes when the drop size
   decreases with time. The evolution process then diverges slightly from
   that obtained using the spherical cap approximation. The influence of
   gravity is also considered for both hanging and sitting drops.

Abstract = {The preferred temperatures of grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella
   (Valenciennes), and brema carp, Megalobrama amblycephala (Yih), were
   determined individually and together in both horizontal and vertical
   gradients. No significant difference was found by two methods between
   the preferred temperatures in either species of carp (28.0-28.5 degrees
   C) when the fish were placed individually. However, when the two species
   of carp were placed together, C. idella was displaced thermally,
   preferring a temperature of 23.5 degrees C, which was significantly
   lower than that obtained when it was held separately. This suggests
   that, if both species of carp are placed in ponds forming part of a
   Chinese polyculture system, C. idella will seek out a lower temperature
   as a mechanism to avoid competition, and therefore, the growth of this
   species will be reduced.},

Abstract = {Analyses of the distributional patterns of weevils (Coleoptera:
   Curculionoidea) from several Subantarctic islands, namely, Campbell,
   Auckland, Snares, Antipodes, Chatham, Falklands, Tierra del Fuego,
   Tristan da Cunha, Inaccessible, Nightingale, Gough, Marion, Prince
   Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Heard, as well as South America and New
   Zealand, were carried out in order to determine their historical
   relationships, and to test the validity of Udvardy's (1987)
   Insulantarctica province. Three parsimony analyses of endemicity (PAE)
   considering (a) only species, (b) only supraspecific taxa, and (c)
   species and supraspecific taxa together, were undertaken. The following
   four groups emerged from the analyses: (1) New Zealand with the Snares,
   Auckland, Campbell, and Chatham Is., where New Zealand is the sister
   area to the Chatham Is.; and the Auckland Is. are the sister area to
   Campbell I.; (2) South America with the Falkland Is. and Tierra del
   Fuego, where South America and Tierra del Fuego together are the sister
   area to the Falkland Is.; (3) Tristan da Cunha-Gough group, with the
   islands following the sequence Gough, Tristan da Cunha, Inaccessible,
   and Nightingale Is.; and (4) Kerguelen, Heard, Crozet, Marion, and
   Prince Edward Is., with Kerguelen and Heard Is. being sister areas, and
   Marion and Prince Edward Is. together being the sister area to the
   Crozet Is. It is concluded that the weevil fauna does not support the
   existence of an Insulantarctica province; the similarities among the
   different Subantarctic islands are due more to similar environmental
   conditions rather than to a common history.},

Abstract = {Subacute hyperoxia may cause basement membrane disruption and subsequent
   fibrosis. To test the role of extracellular matrix degradation in
   hyperoxic damage, we analyzed the expression of gelatinases A and B and
   tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 in rats
   exposed to 85\% O-2. Oxygen-exposed rats were studied at 1, 3, 5, and 7
   days, and compared with air-breathing rats. Lung mRNAs assayed by
   Northern and in situ hybridization showed an up-regulation of lung
   gelatinases A and B from the 3rd day on. Gelatinase A was localized in
   alveolar macrophages and in interstitial and alveolar epithelial cells.
   Gelatinase B mRNA and protein were localized in macrophages and
   bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells. Increased gelatinase A and B
   activities were demonstrated in bronchoalveolar lavage. TIMP-1 and
   TIMP-2 were constitutively expressed, and only TIMP-1 displayed a
   moderate increase with hyperoxia. To elucidate transcriptional
   mechanisms for increased gelatinase B expression after hyperoxia,
   nuclear transcription factor-kappa beta activation was explored.
   Oxidative stress significantly increased the lung expression of nuclear
   transcription factor-kappa beta (p65) protein, and nuclear transcription
   factor-kappa beta activation and increased levels of gelatinases A and B
   were found in isolated type II alveolar cells obtained from hyperoxic
   rats. Conceivably, subacute hyperoxia induces excessive gelatinase
   activity, which may contribute to lung damage.},

Abstract = {In this study we evaluated the histomorphology and ultrastructure of the
   oviduct of newly hatched chicks, as well as the immunohistochemical
   expression of progesterone receptor (PR) in this tissue after
   follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) treatment on days 13, 15 and 17 of
   embryonic development. Results indicated a marked difference in the
   histology of the oviduct of newly hatched chicks treated with FSH.
   Magnum mucosa from these animals presented a pseudostratified epithelium
   with evaginations from the lumen into the epithelium and from the latter
   into the stroma beneath where tubular glands are formed. In contrast
   magnum mucosa from control animals presented columnar epithelium with no
   evaginations. In magnum epithelium FSH also induced the formation of
   cilia and microvilli projections into the lumen as well as an increase
   in the wall and lumen areas and in the density of nuclei per unit-area.
   PR immunoreactivity was only observed in the oviduct of FSH treated
   animals. PR was located in the nucleus of epithelial luminal cells,
   mucosal stromal cells and smooth muscle cells. These findings suggest
   that FSH induces an adequate hormonal milieu for the cytodifferentiation
   and PR gene expression in the chick oviduct.},

Abstract = {The structure and seasonal changes of the oviductal-cloacal junction
   remain poorly understood in most squamates. This study was undertaken to
   describe the histology of the oviductal-cloaca junction of a female
   viviparous snake Toluca lineata, during gestation, previtellogenesis,
   and vitellogenesis. The oviductal-cloacal junction exhibits a wider
   lumen and thicker layers of connective tissue, smooth muscle layers, and
   total wall width compared to the posterior vagina. The lining is
   characterized by thick, short longitudinal mucosal folds. The luminal
   epithelia differ morphologically from anterior to posterior portions of
   the oviductal-cloacal junction. The anterior portion is lined with a
   simple columnar epithelium composed of nonciliated cells. The middle
   portion is lined with stratified epithelium that contains an apical
   columnar cell layer that undergoes morphological changes coincident with
   the reproductive cycle. The posterior portion is lined with a stratified
   squamous epithelium. The connective tissue underlying the epithelium
   contains numerous ovoid cells having abundant acidophilic cytoplasmic
   granules-eosinophils. Copulation occurs during the previtellogenic
   stage, as evidenced by the presence of abundant spermatozoa in the lumen
   of the anterior portion and of a copulatory plug in the middle and
   posterior portion of the oviductal-cloacal junction. J. Morphol.

Abstract = {The electronic structure of nitrogen-doped tetrahedral carbon clusters,
   both amorphous and crystalline, with 21, 57 and 59 carbon atoms and
   various ring topologies, were studied using the self-consistent ab
   initio density functional theory-local density approximation (DFT-LDA).
   All clusters were hydrogen saturated. Clusters with n = 0, 1 and 4
   nitrogen atoms were analyzed for each structure using an initial
   interatomic distance of 0.154 nm as in the bulk. All clusters were
   energy optimized maintaining tetrahedral symmetry and the position of
   the outermost atoms in order to simulate the inertia of the bulk. For
   all the clusters the energy gap increases with one N. For the 21-atom
   cluster which contains only 6-atom boat-rings the gap remains
   practically constant as n increases from 1, 6.60 to 4, 6.51 eV, unlike
   the other clusters. The Fermi energy varies from the top of the valence
   band to the bottom of the conduction band as the nitrogen concentration
   increases. In the forced fourfold coordinated environment N is a shallow
   donor as is P in Si; however, when N becomes essentially threefold
   coordinated, states appear in the middle of the gap. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {1 Gaps in the forest canopy allow establishment of many understorey
   species. As gaps close, their: demographic behaviour is affected by
   changing environmental conditions. A demographic analysis of Primula
   vulgaris populations in forest patches with varying canopy openness was
   carried out to investigate the effect of forest canopy dynamics on the
   demography of this forest understorey herb.
   2 Eight P. vulgaris populations across a range of light conditions were
   studied in three deciduous temperate forests in Britain. Demographic
   data were collected in each population during summer 1992, 1993 and
   1994, and stage-based population projection matrices were built to
   describe their demography for two growth periods (1992-93 and 1993-94).
   3 Population growth rate (lambda) varied from 0.97 to 1.98 in 1992-93,
   and from 0.88 to 1.23 in 1993-94. There was a significant positive
   correlation between lambda and diffuse light for the two periods
   studied: generally, population growth rate was lower in darker patches,
   implying that populations decline as the canopy closes. Lower
   lambda-values in 1993-94 were the result of increased mortality and
   decreased fecundity compared to 1992-93. In most cases the observed
   population structures were significantly different from the calculated
   stable stage distributions.
   4 Sensitivity analysis showed that 3,was most sensitive to changes in
   matrix transitions that corresponded to growth from small to adult
   stages, especially those that implied fast growth. Elasticity analysis
   revealed that the contribution of fecundity elements to lambda was
   small, but populations in brighter patches showed comparatively higher
   fecundity elasticities than populations under the closed canopy. High
   elasticities corresponded to the entries that implied growth (especially
   in brighter patches) or persistence in adult categories (predominantly
   in darker patches).
   5 The observed variation in the demography of P. vulgaris in different
   patches along the forest regeneration cycle stresses the importance of
   studying the variation in plant population dynamics across the range of
   habitat patches in which the plant naturally occurs.},

Abstract = {The transient conjugate cooling of a thin horizontal plate enclosed in
   an adiabatic cavity is studied using asymptotic and numerical
   techniques. The upper surface of the plate is in contact with a fluid
   initially at rest. The most important parameter to be obtained is the
   nondimensional cooling time, which depends on the aspect ratio of the
   plate E. the nondimensional longitudinal heat conductance of the plate
   alpha and the Prandtl number of the fluid Pi, for large values of the
   Rayleigh number of the laminar natural boundary layer flow induced by
   the density changes. Both the thermally thin (alpha much greater than
   epsilon(2)) and thick wail regimes (alpha similar to epsilon(2)) are
   considered in this payer. A minimum nondimensional cooling Lime is
   achieved for a thin plate (epsilon --> 0) for values of the
   nondimensional longitudinal thermal conductance of the plate alpha, such
   as epsilon(2) much less than alpha much less than 1. That is, the
   process is faster if the longitudinal heat conduction through the wall
   is negligible. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   0.0125, 0.01875, 0.025 and 0.05, were synthesized and characterized by
   resistance vs, temperature measurements, X-ray diffraction and by
   Mossbauer spectroscopy. In order to make the site assignment for the Fe
   atoms, a Rietveld refinement of the X-ray spectra was performed and a
   point charge calculation of the quadrupole splitting for all the
   possible oxygen environments around the two Cu sites was carried out,
   taking into account the two possible ionic states of the iron atoms that
   occupy those sites. We found that, for low level iron concentrations,
   the Fe atoms occupy only the Cu(1) sites of the structure in a fivefold
   pyramidal coordination, with the apical oxygen atom placed along the
   a-axis between the double chains of the unit cell. The presence of these
   extra oxygen atoms in the crystal structure could be related to the
   rapid T-c reduction as iron concentration increases. (C) 1998 Published

Abstract = {The population structure of variation in a nuclear actin intron and the
   control region of mitochondrial DNA is described for humpback whales
   from eight regions in the North Pacific Ocean: central California, Baja
   Peninsula, nearshore Mexico (Bahia Banderas), offshore Mexico (Socorro
   Island), southeastern Alaska, central Alaska (Prince Williams Sound),
   Hawaii and Japan (Ogasawara Islands). Primary mtDNA haplotypes and
   intron alleles were identified using selected restriction fragment
   length polymorphisms of target sequences amplified by the polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR-RFLP). There was little evidence of heterogeneity in
   the frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes or actin intron alleles due to the
   year or sex composition of the sample. However, frequencies of four
   mtlDNA haplotypes showed marked regional differences in their
   distributions (Phi(ST) = 0.277; P < 0.001; n = 205 individuals) while
   the two alleles showed significant, but less marked, regional
   differences (Phi(ST) = 0.033; P < 0.013; n = 400 chromosomes). An
   hierarchical analysis of variance in frequencies of haplotypes and
   alleles supported the grouping of six regions into a central and eastern
   stock with further partitioning of variance among regions within stocks
   for haplotypes but not for alleles. Based on available genetic and
   demographic evidence, the southeastern Alaska and central California
   feeding grounds were selected for additional analyses of nuclear
   differentiation using allelic variation at four microsatellite loci. All
   four loci showed significant differences in allele frequencies (overall
   F-ST = 0.043; P < 0.001; average n = 139 chromosomes per locus),
   indicating at least partial reproductive isolation between the two
   regions as well as the segregation of mtDNA lineages. Although the two
   feeding grounds were not panmictic for nuclear or mitochondrial loci,
   estimates of long-term migration rates suggested that male-mediated gene
   flow was several-fold greater than female gene flow. These results
   include and extend the range and sample size of previously published
   work, providing additional evidence for the significance of genetic
   management units within oceanic populations of humpback whales.},

Abstract = {The Cooper pair (pairon) field operator psi(r, t) changes in time,
   following Heisenberg's equation of motion. If the system Hamiltonian H
   contains the pairon kinetic energies h(0), the condensation energy per
   pairon alpha(< 0) and the repulsive point-like potential beta
   delta(r(1)-r(2)), beta > 0, the evolution equation for psi is
   non-linear, from which we obtain the Ginzburg-Landau equation:
   h(0)(r, -ih del) Psi(sigma)(r) + alpha Psi(sigma)(r) + beta|
   Psi(sigma)(r) |(2) Psi(sigma)(r) = 0
   for the complex order parameter Psi(sigma)(r) := < r | n(1/2) | sigma >,
   where sigma denotes the state of the condensed pairons, and n the pairon
   density operator. The total kinetic energy h(0) for ``electron{''} (1)
   and ``hole{''} (2) pairons is
   h(0) Psi(sigma)(r) = \{1/2v(F)((1)) | -ih del + 2eA(r) | + 1/2v(F)((2))

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine the effect of salinity and pH on
   tolerance to low dissolved oxygen concentration in postlarval (PL 12; 18
   mg met weight) and early juvenile (720 mg wet weight) Peneaus setiferus.
   Lethal levels of dissolved oxygen were determined in animals at four
   combinations of salinity and pH (36 and 15 ppt salinity and pH 6 and 8).
   For postlarvae, the 48-h LC50 for dissolved oxygen was 1.27 mgO(2)/L at
   15 ppt and pH8, and was significantly lower than that obtained in the
   other combinations of salinity and pH (P < 0,05). For juveniles, the
   72-h LC50 was 1.16 mg/L at 15 ppt and pH 8, and was significantly lower
   than that obtained in the other combinations of salinity and pH (P <
   0.05). A significant interaction between salinity and pH was observed.
   These results suggest that the intensive culture of P. setiferus may be
   conducted at moderate salinity, where shrimp appear to be more tolerant
   of low concentrations of oxygen than at higher salinities.},

Abstract = {The motion of a particle in a Coulomb field is analyzed with the help of
   the conserved Hamilton vector. This affords a simple way of obtaining
   both the orbit in configuration space and the hodograph in velocity
   space. We show how to obtain the Hamilton vector, then, with its help,
   we get the equations of both trajectories. We next show that the
   trajectories of the Coulomb problem in velocity space are all circular.
   We also exhibit a geometric method for calculating the deflection angle
   in the case of scattering trajectories and then we derive the Rutherford
   scattering formula. We also discuss an approximate method which takes
   advantage of the Hamilton vector for studying scattering in a centrally
   perturbed Coulomb field. As an example of the use of this approach the
   case of an inverse cubic perturbation is discussed in some detail.},

Abstract = {The geographic and spatial distribution of more than 221,000 bird
   specimens collected in Mexico was analyzed on a grid of 1 degrees blocks
   to assess adequacy of representation of the country's avifauna in world
   systematic collections. Frequency distributions of specimens per block,
   specimens per species expect-ed in blocks and total specimens per
   species were all severely right-skewed, with a few blocks well sampled
   but most represented by very few specimens. Overall, seven scattered
   blacks out of about 240 were considered well sampled. The best sampled
   species in the country (House Finch Carpodacus mexicanus) and the best
   sampled Mexican endemic species (Russet Nightingale-thrush Catharus
   occidentalis) were characterized by uneven and inadequate spatiotemporal
   sampling, especially in autumn, when plumages are generally fresh and
   most useful for studies of geographic variation; sampling for a species
   close to the median of the distribution (Great Black-hawk Buteogallus
   urubitinga) was scattered and inappropriate for statistical analysis,
   Results suggest strongly that sampling of Mexican birds is incomplete,
   that continued scientific collecting is needed to complete knowledge of
   the country's avifauna and that similar collecting efforts will be
   necessary throughout much of the tropics.},

Abstract = {1. Cell sub-populations of the ovary of newly-hatched chicks were
   assessed following follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) treatment during
   embryonic development. Changes in cell number and the amount of
   oestradiol in serum were determined.
   2. White Leghorn chick embryos received 1 mu g FSH applied to the
   chorioallantoic membrane at 13, 15, and 17 d of incubation. Within 24 h
   after hatching, animals were killed and blood was collected. The left
   ovary was immediately removed then weighed and processed by an
   enzymatic-mechanical dissociation method for total cell count. An
   air-drying method was also used for meiotic preparations to study the
   germinal cells.
   3. The pre-follicular ovary is able to respond to FSH by inducing an
   increase both in the serum oestradiol concentration and in the number of
   steroidogenic cells and of poorly differentiated cells of the ovarian
   medulla.
   4. FSH increases the number of oogonia, which are responsible for a
   sharp increase in the total population of germ cells in the FSH-treated
   ovary.
   5. It is possible that FSH acts to increase the proliferation of oogonia
   and a delay in the meiotic prophase through a change in the
   microenvironment rather than by a direct effect on germ cells.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The relativistic force exerted by a classical electromagnetic field on
   an electron is examined from the point of view that associates the
   differential geometry of the space-time trajectory with a continuous
   group of transformations. The group relevant to this particular case is
   the group generated by the electromagnetic field tensor (electrodynamic
   group), This group is studied in some detail by treating separately the
   two parts of the Lienard-Wiechert expression for the tenser. The
   intrinsic differential equations of the space-time trajectories
   associated with the electrodynamic group are obtained by the Cartan
   method of the moving frame. These equations show that the curvature of
   the trajectory is associated only with the generalized Coulomb held and
   the hypertorsion with the radiation field. According to these equations,
   the relativistic force may have two components along orthogonal
   spacelike directions: The first, an apparent force, reduces to the
   Coulomb force in the nonrelativistic limit. The other is orthogonal to
   the four-momentum and to the apparent force; this is the radiation
   reaction force. In the nonrelativistic limit it manifests itself as a
   frictional force reducing the momentum. The approach also offers a point
   of view of the conventional treatment of radiation reaction in which the
   nonlocality in time emerges from the geometry of the problem. The
   implications pertaining to Other areas of physics of the causal
   connection found between the hypertorsion and the radiation field are
   briefly considered. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Ovule and seed development is described for Lacandonia schismatica, a
   species whose androecium is surrounded by the gynoecium. The ovule in
   each carpel is basal, anatropous, tenuinucellate, and bitegmic. The
   female gametophyte is formed by the micropylar megaspore cell, after a
   coenocytic stage of the four megaspore nuclei. The mature female
   gametophyte has the normal complement of seven cells and eight nuclei.
   We propose a new type of female gametophyte development on the basis of
   the coenocytic stage of the tetrad, the cellularization of the tetrad,
   and the survival of the micropylar spore. At seed dispersal time, the
   embryo has similar to 10-20 cells. Endosperm development is of the
   nuclear type. At maturity, endosperm cells show starch and protein
   inclusions as well as polysaccharides in their thick walls. The seed

Abstract = {We studied the histomorphometric changes induced in the left ovary of

   during embryonic development. After FSH treatment the thickness of the
   ovarian cortex, the number per unit of area and total mass per ovary of
   germ and pregranulosa cells increased, accompanied by hypertrophy of the
   pregranulosa cells. The volume of interstitial cells cords, lacunar
   system, and blood capillaries was increased and modifications in poorly
   differentiated cells were also obsrved. The number of interstitial cells
   and the average volume of interstitial cells also increased, from which
   we can deduce that these two last events are important in the
   enlargement of the interstitial cell cords. These findings suggest that
   the prefollicular ovary is able to respond to FSH, inducing structural
   changes both in the ovarian cortex as well as in the subcortical
   medulla.},

Abstract = {The Cooper pair (pairon) field operator psi(dagger) (r, t) changes,
   following Heisenberg's equation of motion. If the Hamiltonian H contains
   pairon kinetic energies h(0), a condensation energy alpha(< 0) and a
   repulsive point-like interpairon interaction beta delta(r(1) - r(2)),
   beta > 0, the evolution equation for psi is nonlinear, from which we
   obtain the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation:
   h(0)(r -i (h) over bar del)Psi(sigma)(r)+alpha Psi(sigma)(r)+beta
   \textbackslash{}Psi(sigma)(r)\textbackslash{}(2) Psi(sigma)(r)=0
   for the GL wave function Psi(sigma)(r)drop(r \textbackslash{} n(1/2)
   \textbackslash{}sigma), where a denotes the state of the condensed
   pairons, and n the density operator. The GL equation with alpha =
   -epsilon g(T) is shown to hold for all temperatures (T) below T-c, where
   epsilon(g) is the pairon energy gap. Its equilibrium solution yields
   that the condensed pairon density n(0)(T) =
   \textbackslash{}Psi(sigma)(r)\textbackslash{}(2) is proportional to
   epsilon(g)(T) The original GL T-dependence of the expansion parameters
   near T-c : alpha = -b(T-c-T), beta = constant is justified. With the
   assumption of h(0), a new formula for the penetration depth is obtained.},

Abstract = {In a greenhouse experiment, seedling survival of two oak species
   (Quercus rugosa and Q. laurina) was greatly affected by the excision of
   cotyledons 1 mo after germination, with a greater impact on Q. laurina.
   The effect of seed size was also significant for both species, with a
   positive correlation between seed mass and survival and growth. The
   effect of cotyledon excision on seedling growth persisted throughout the
   first growing season in Q. rugosa and was not analyzed for Q. laurina
   due to the low number of seedlings that survived cotyledon excision.
   Seed size significantly affected seedling height, diameter, leaf area,
   and biomass at 6 mo. Seed size and cotyledon retention affected the
   ability of Q. rugosa to recover from herbivory, as both factors had a
   significant effect on relative growth rates after aerial biomass
   removal. The results show that seedlings originating from large seeds
   can better endure loss of cotyledons and aerial biomass and thus are
   better equipped to confront stress early in their lives.},

Abstract = {The effects of light intensity and duration on metabolic and behavioral
   parameters of two species of crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and
   Procambarus digueti, were studied. Sixty animals of each species were
   submitted to high irradiance conditions of two different photoperiod
   lengths, one normal light/dark (LD) 12:12 and one extreme LD 20:4 for 2
   weeks. Hemolymph, lactate and oxygen consumption were determined
   throughout the experimental period. Simultaneously in 18 additional
   animals of each species, motor activity was individually recorded under
   the same control and experimental conditions. Both species showed a
   decrease in oxygen uptake and an increase in hemolymph lactate
   concentration. The statistical significance of this finding was higher
   for LD 20:4. This extreme condition evoked a significant decrease of
   motor activity in P. clarkii and a high mortality rate in P, digueti. P.
   digueti did not survive after the experiment, whereas P. clarkii
   survived and adapted to the laboratory conditions. Changes in metabolic
   and behavioral parameters could indicate different adaptation abilities
   in these species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {The weevil species Listroderes abditus Enderlein belongs in the subtribe
   Listroderina. This species had been previously transferred to
   Antarctobius, based on characters from the adult morphology. However,
   larval characters suggest that it was placed correctly in Listroderes. A
   cladistic analysis of this species and nine other rhytirrhinines for
   which larvae are known was performed, based on 56 morphological
   characters (32 from larvae and 24 from adults). According to the single
   cladogram obtained (78 steps, CI = 0.65, and RI = 0.72), L. abditus
   should be included in Listroderes rather than in Antarctobius. Larval
   and adult characters were also analysed separately, leading to poorer
   resolution in comparison with the simultaneous analysis, and suggesting
   that a stable classification requires the analysis of data from both
   life stages.},

   Seasonal variation of the abundance was positively correlated with

   shared only 12 Collembola species with the leaf litter and soil from the

Abstract = {Biotransformation of several structurally related 2B compounds to
   reactive metabolites was evaluated in the somatic w/w+ assay of
   Drosophila melanogaster. Chemicals tested were the dichlorinated alkanes
   dichloromethane (DCM), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and 1,3-dichloropropane
   (DCP); the thiouracil derivatives 5-methyl, 2-thiouracil (5M2TU),
   6-methyl, 2-thiouracil (6M2TU), and 5-propyl, 2-thiouracil (5P2TU) and
   the plastic monomer styrene (SN) and its metabolite styrene 7,8-oxide
   (SO). The tester strains used consisted of one wild-type
   insecticide-susceptible (IS) laboratory strain (Leiden-S, ST), and two
   insecticide-resistant (IR) strains (Hikone-R, HK, and Haag-R, HG). The
   latter have high cytochrome P450-dependent bioactivation capacities.
   Drosophila larvae heterozygous for the wild-type report gene w+ were
   exposed chronically to at least three different exposure doses of each
   compound. A total of 53,694 eyes were analyzed. A positive genotoxic
   activity was obtained for DCM and for 6M2TU at all exposure doses and
   genotypes analyzed, and for SO in the IR strains HK-R and HG-R. An
   overall weakly recombinagenic response was shown by DCE and 5M2TU. The
   chemicals DCP, 5P2TU, and STY proved to be overall negative in IR as
   well as in IS strains, and SO was negative in the standard stock.
   Biotransformation mediated by cytochrome P450 monoxigenases to reactive
   metabolites is discussed. (C) 1998 Wiley Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Effect of dissolved oxygen on the energy balance and survival of
   Penaeus setiferus juveniles},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {67-75},
Abstract = {Penaeus setiferus, the white shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico, is an
   abundant species in the coastal lagoons and estuaries, where it can
   experience anoxic conditions. This study was designed with the purpose
   of measuring the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the assimilation of
   ingested food (AS), by measuring the respiratory rate (R) and the
   biomass production of P, setiferus during its growth (P) process (AS = R
   + P). Postlarvae of this species (PL27: 27 d after the last metamorphic
   molting) were exposed to 2, 3, 4 and 5.8 mg l(-1) DO for 50 d. P was
   obtained from the transformation into energy units (J g(-1) dw d(-1)) of
   the growth rate. The respiratory rate was determined by evaluating
   oxygen consumption of fasting shrimp and spontaneous activity (routine
   metabolism: R-rout) and measuring apparent heat increase (R-AHI).
   Throughout the experimental periods, survival was not affected by DO
   levels and remained within 77 and 85\%. P was constant between 5.4 and 4
   mg l(-1) DO but decreased at lower DO levels (p < 0.05). R-rout was
   affected by DO, with the highest levels observed in shrimp exposed at 4
   and 5.8 mg l(-1) DO and the lowest at 2 mg l(-1) DO (p < 0.05). The
   opposite effect was seen in R-AHI, where the highest levels were
   registered in shrimp kept at 2 mg l(-1) DO and the lowest at 5.8 mg
   l(-1) (p < 0.05). The reason behind a higher R-AHI in shrimp kept at a
   lower DO level was the result of more time being invested in the
   mechanical and biochemical transformation of the food, which acts as a
   metabolical brake. AS was constant between 5.8 and 4 mg l(-1) DO, but
   decreased with respect to a DO reduction. Accordingly, a critical level
   was established for AS at 4 mg l(-1) DO, below which AS becomes
   dependent on DO. In contrast, the amount of assimilated energy directed
   to production (P/AS) increased with respect to DO reduction when the
   shrimp were exposed to DO levels below 4 mg l(-1). These results show
   that the side effects produced by low DO levels are generally
   compensated by an increase in production efficiency despite reduced
   respiratory efficiency.},

Abstract = {Genotoxic activation of hydrazine (HZ), two symmetrical
   dialkylhydrazines, namely, 1,2dimethylhydrazine and 1,2-diethylhydrazine
   (SDMH and SDEH), thiourea (TU) and ethylene thiourea (ETU) has been
   evaluated by means of the w/w + somatic assay of Drosophila. Both low
   bioactivation insecticide-susceptible (IS) and high biotransformation
   insecticide-resistant (IR) strains were used. The combined application
   of insecticide-susceptible and insecticide-resistant strains should, in
   principle, detect somatic cell recombinagens in the Drosophila
   melanogaster in vivo w/w + assay. The IS strain was more susceptible to
   toxicity induced by the test chemicals than the IR stocks. Its
   performance in the biotransformation of the chemicals tested was rather
   poor. TU was inactive in all strains. With the active compounds, spot
   frequencies increased approximately linearly with dose for each spot
   type. SDEH gave a strong positive result in all three female genotypes
   exposed. HZ, ETU and SDMH were overall weakly positive in the IR strain
   Haag-79 (HG-R). Interestingly, ETU was clearly positive in the IR
   Hikone-R (HK-R) strain. A comparison of the recombinagenic potencies
   between the active and the weakly positive compounds, and among strains,
   showed pronounced genotype-dependent differences between the low and the
   high bioactivation strains. The ability of Drosophila to express several
   procarcinogens in relation to insecticide-resistance after activation
   catalyzed by CYP450 enzymes is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {Many eukaryotic nuclear genomes as well as mitochondrial plasmids
   contain genes displaying evident sequence similarity to those encoding
   the single-subunit RNA polymerase (ssRNAP) of bacteriophage T7 and its
   relatives. We have collected and aligned these ssRNAP sequences and have
   constructed unrooted phylogenetic trees that demonstrate the separation
   of ssRNAPs into three well-defined and nonoverlapping clusters
   (phage-encoded, nucleus-encoded, and plasmid-encoded). Our analyses
   indicate that these three subfamiles of T7-1ike RNAPs shared a common
   ancestor; however, the order in which the groups diverged cannot be
   inferred from available data. On the basis of structural similarities
   and mutational data, we suggest that the ancestral ssRNAP gene may have
   arisen via duplication and divergence of a DNA polymerase or reverse
   transcriptase gene. Considering the current phylogenetic distribution of
   ssRNAP sequences, we further suggest that the origin of the ancestral
   ssRNAP gene closely paralleled in time the introduction of mitochondria
   into eukaryotic cells through a eubacterial endosymbiosis.},

Abstract = {For an almost disjoint family (a.d.f.) Sigma of subsets of omega, let
   Psi(Sigma) be the Mrowka-Isbell space on Sigma. In this article we will
   analyze the following problem: given an a.d.f. Sigma and a function
   phi:Sigma --> \{0: 1\} (respectively phi:Sigma --> R) is it possible to
   extend phi continuously to a big enough subspace Sigma boolean OR N of
   Psi(Sigma) for which cl(Psi(Sigma)) N superset of Sigma? Such an
   extension is called essential. We will prove that: (i) for every a.d.f.
   Sigma of cardinality 2(N0) we can find a function phi:Sigma --> \{0, I\}
   without essential extensions; (ii) for every m.a.d. family Sigma there
   exists a function phi:Sigma --> R that has no essential extension; and
   (iii) there exists a Mrowka-Isbell space Psi(Sigma) of cardinality N-1
   such that every function phi:Sigma --> R with at least two different
   uncountable fibers, has no full extension. On the other hand, under
   Martin's Axiom every function phi:Sigma --> \{0, 1\} (respectively
   phi:Sigma --> R) has an essential extension if
   \textbackslash{}Sigma\textbackslash{} < 2(N0). Finally, we analyze these
   questions under CH and by adding new Cohen reals to a ground model M
   showing that the existence of an uncountable a.d.f. Sigma for which
   every onto function phi:Sigma --> \{0, 1\} with infinite fibers has no
   essential extensions is consistent with ZFC. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The critical thermal maximum (CTM) method was used to determine the
   acute effect of ammonia, nitrite and the combined effect of both
   toxicants on the thermal tolerance of white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus)
   postlarvae. Ammonia did not affect the temperature response of shrimp.
   Nitrite exposure significantly decreased the temperature tolerance of
   postlarvae. Coexposure to ammonia and nitrite mixtures modified the CTM;
   an inverse relationship between ammonia/nitrite toxicity ratios and the
   CTM was observed. In single exposure, ammonia and nitrite concentrations
   were related to the mortality rate. No relation was observed between
   shrimp mortality and the thermal tolerance. Our results suggest that
   exposure to these nitrogenous compounds can decrease the ability of
   white shrimp postlarvae to tolerate additional thermal stress.},

Abstract = {The spin-Hamiltonian zero-field splitting parameter b(2)(0) is measured

   Cs2NaLaCl6. Both sites possess principal Zaxes along (100)
   crystallographic directions. Electron spin resonance measurements were
   made at X-band frequencies (9.2 GHz) in the temperature range from 12.8
   to 300 K. The present results are taken into account in order to
   establish a possible relation between the spin-Hamiltonian parameter

Abstract = {The HIS6 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YNN282 is able to
   complement both the S. cerevisiae his6 and the Escherichia coli hisA
   mutations. The cloning and the nucleotide sequence indicated that this
   gene encodes a putative
   phosphoribosyl-5-amino-1-phosphoribosyl-4-imidazolecarboxiamide
   isomerase (5' Pro-FAR isomerase, EC 5.3.1.16) of 261 amino acids, with a
   molecular weight of 29 554. The HIS6 gene product shares a significant
   degree of sequence similarity with the prokaryotic HisA proteins and
   HisF proteins, and with the C-terminal domain of the S. cerevisiae HIS7
   protein (homologous to HisF), indicating that the yeast HIS6 and HIS7
   genes are paralogous. Moreover, the HIS6 gene is organized into two
   homologous modules half the size of the entire gene, typical of all the
   known prokaryotic hisA and hisF genes. The structure of the yeast HIS6
   gene supports the two-step evolutionary model suggested by Fani et al.
   (J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38:489-495) to explain the present-day hisA and
   hisF genes. According to this idea, the hisF gene originated from the
   duplication of an ancestral hisA gene which, in turn, was the result of
   an earlier gene elongation event involving an ancestral module half the
   size of the extant gene. Results reported in this paper also suggest
   that these two successive paralogous gene duplications took probably
   place in the early steps of molecular evolution of the histidine
   pathway, well before the diversification of the three domains, and that
   this pathway was one of the metabolic activities of the last common
   ancestor. The molecular evolution of the yeast HIS6 and HIS7 genes is
   also discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {When discriminant analysis is used in practice for assessing the
   usefulness of diagnostic markers, the lack of control over covariates
   motivates the need for their adjustment in the analysis. This necessity
   for adjustment arises especially when the researcher's aim is
   classification based on a set of diagnostic markers and is not based on
   a set of covariates for which there exists known heterogeneity among the
   subjects with respect to the groups under consideration. The traditional
   covariance-adjusted approach is restrictive for such applications in
   that they assume linear covariates and a normal distribution for the the
   feature vector. Further, there is no available method for variable
   selection in using such covariance-adjusted models. In this paper, we
   generalize the traditional covariance-adjusted model to a general normal
   and logistic model, where these generalized models not only relax the
   distributional assumptions on the feature vector but also allow for
   nonlinear covariates. Exact and asymptotic tests are also derived for
   the problem of variable selection for these new models. The methodology
   is illustrated with both simulated data and an actual data set from a
   psychiatric study on using the Social Rhythm Metric for patients with
   anxiety disorders.},

Title = {Use of lipid reserves by monarch butterflies overwintering in Mexico:
   Implications for conservation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {934-947},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {During their 5-mo overwintering period in Mexico, tens of millions of
   monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) form dense aggregations in
   forests dominated by oyamel fir trees (Abies religiosa). These forests
   provide a cool, moist environment that most monarchs use to maintain a
   state of reproductive diapause and to remain largely inactive until
   March, when they migrate back to the southern United States. In 1986,
   the Mexican government created the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere
   Reserve (MBSBR), but it is under pressure to allow forest extractions
   from core areas of the reserve. A recent argument to justify logging
   maintains that tree extraction would benefit monarchs by creating forest
   openings in which more plants would flower. The increased availability
   of nectar might mean that fewer monarchs would deplete their lipid
   contents, and therefore, more monarchs would survive the overwintering
   period.
   We investigated this hypothesis by comparing, throughout the
   overwintering period, lipid utilization and three other physical
   characteristics of monarch butterflies that were clustered on trees vs.
   monarchs that were collected while they visited flowers. Comparisons
   were also made with autumn migrants collected in Texas, successful
   spring migrants collected in the southern United States, and
   reproductively active summer generations collected in Wisconsin and
   Minnesota. We also examined changes in lipid mass during the annual
   cycle of eastern North American monarch populations.
   We found that clustered butterflies had significantly higher lipid mass,
   water content, lean mass, and larger wings than did monarchs collected
   from flowers. These differences were consistent throughout the
   overwintering period. Clustered monarchs consumed their lipid reserves
   passively in relation to the ambient temperature, as would be expected
   based on their resting metabolic rate. In contrast, a high proportion of
   flower-visiting monarchs had lipid masses close to zero; very few had
   medium or high lipid levels. This suggests that flower-visiting monarchs
   either maintained their lipid reserves at low levels by visiting
   flowers, but were unable to reach levels found in clustered monarchs, or
   that, as the flower-visiting monarchs died, clustered monarchs with low
   lipid reserves departed from their roosting trees to visit flowers.
   Migrating monarchs collected in April in the southern United Stales had
   significantly higher Lipid masses than did flower-visiting monarchs
   collected in March at the overwintering site. Furthermore, migrating
   monarchs arrived in the southern United States with <50\% of the lipid
   mass found in clustered, overwintering monarchs in March. Due to this
   apparent cost of migration, we hypothesize that the cohorts of monarchs
   visiting flowers at the overwintering site may not be able to migrate
   successfully to breeding areas in the southern United States. Our data
   do not support the hypothesis that there is a need to create open areas
   in the core zones of the MBSBR to promote flower production for monarchs
   overwintering in Mexico. To the contrary, the pattern of lipid loss
   observed in monarchs clustered in shaded areas is consistent with the
   hypothesis that intact, closed forest is necessary for successful
   overwintering because it permits monarchs to conserve their lipid
   reserves for the spring migration.},

   extracellular matrix accumulation are crucial in the pathogenesis of
   lung fibrosis. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 participates in both
   processes, but its role in lung fibrogenesis has not been evaluated. We
   analyzed the expression of FGF-1 and of FGF receptor (FGFR) in a model
   of lung fibrosis induced in rats with paraquat plus hyperoxia.
   Experimental and control animals were killed at 48 h and 2, 4, and 8 wk,
   and the lungs were studied by in situ hybridization,
   immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot. In normal lungs, scattered
   macrophages contained FGF-1. In contrast, at all times examined, the
   injured lungs exhibited FGF-1 transcript and the immunoreactive protein,
   mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. In advanced
   fibrotic lesions, fibroblasts also appeared stained. Northern blot
   corroborated the upregulation of FGF-1 mRNA. FGFR was not observed in
   normal lungs, whereas it was strongly increased in the damaged lungs and
   was virtually immunolocalized in the same cell types as the
   corresponding ligand. These findings suggest that FGF-1 and FGFR are
   actively synthesized during the development of pulmonary fibrosis.},

   of BM. The electronic part is obtained from self consistent ab initio

   derivatives of the energy using the Hartree-Fock approximation for the
   electronic part. Both, the electronic and vibrational parts are
   classified accordingly to the irreducible representations of the D-4h

   The phonon contribution to the specific heat is calculated through the

   phonon density of states. The force constants are obtained from a first

Abstract = {The nuclei of epithelial cells of the uterine cervix of normal women and
   of patients with Various degrees of dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and
   invasive carcinoma were studied by means of electron microscopy. Nuclear
   ribonucleoprotein components and chromatin were contrasted using
   preferential methods for RNA and DNA. Changes in the distribution of the
   extranucleolar ribonucleoprotein-containing structures were found,
   ranging from low-grade dysplastic lesions to invasive carcinoma.
   Compared with normal epithelial cells, dysplastic and neoplastic cells
   possess more nuclear bodies, as well as deep invaginations of the
   nuclear envelope and lobulations. Morphometric parameters estimated were
   nuclear volume, numerical density of perichromatin granules (PCG), and
   fraction of nuclear volume occupied by compact chromatin. The pattern of
   values of these parameters in the cell layers of normal cervical
   epithelium was disrupted in all the lesions. These data suggest that the
   processes studied induce early alterations in transcription and
   processing and/or exportation of mRNA to the cytoplasm. Two populations
   of cells were found in invasive carcinomas, one with large nuclei,
   sparse compact chromatin, and few PCG, end the other with small nuclei,
   abundant compact chromatin, and numerous PCG. Their morphologic features
   indicate that the former population is composed of relatively
   undifferentiated cells, while the latter is made up of
   well-differentiated cells which could be neoplastic or entrapped normal
   cells.},

Abstract = {The nuclear structure of the epiblast and skin cells was studied during
   the development of the chick embryo (Gallus domesticus).
   Ribonucleoproteic structures (RNPs) and chromatin were characterized
   with preferential staining techniques. The changes of the frequency of a
   type of RNP particle, the perichromatin granule, from gastrulating
   embryos to newly hatched chick, were analyzed by electron microscopic
   quantitative stereology. The changes of nuclear and nucleolar volume
   were estimated using the light microscope. The differentiation of
   ectoderm from epiblast is characterized by a significant increase in the
   nucleolar volume and in the frequency of perichromatin granules. These
   features suggest that ectoderm differentiation involves a general
   increment of mRNA and rRNA transcription. At the beginning the synthesis
   of a sulfhydryl-rich protein, which is coincident with the thickening of
   the bilayered epithelium to a multilayered epithelium, a large increase
   of the numerical density of perichromatin granules not accompanied by
   any modification of the nucleolar volume was found. The same changes
   characterize the acquisition of epidermal mature cell features
   immediately after hatching. These findings as well as previous results
   concerning the differentiation of central nervous system and striated
   muscle suggest that the increases of the number of perichromatin
   granules take place during the acquisition of new cytophysiological
   states related to functional maturation and not to early stages of cell
   differentiation.},

   In this work we compare the commonly reported procedure in, literature,
   consisting of truncating the potential function from a given abscissa,
   to another proposed method, where the function is vertically shifted to
   zero after the truncation. We show that the first procedure renders more
   mistakes than the second, where mistakes still admittedly occur but
   their appearance notably decreases as a function of distance. We also
   examined the conditions necessary to consider discrete dipoles as being
   continuous beyond the cutoff position and found that the shifted
   procedure performs better than truncating alone.},

   The analysis is restricted to the case where the catalytic activity is
   assumed to be on one lateral surface of the plate, causing an
   asymmetrical heat transfer distribution. The influence of the
   transversal and the longitudinal heat conduction effects through the
   plate are clarified, showing well defined ignition and extinction
   conditions (an S-shaped curve) for high activation energy. The catalytic
   ignition is easier to achieve as the value of the non-dimensional
   longitudinal thermal conductance of the plate increases in the thermally
   thin wall regime, while the converse is true for the thermally thick
   wall regime.},

Abstract = {Type II pneumocytes are multifunctional alveolar epithelial cells that
   play a major role in the maintenance of lung structure and function.
   Recent evidence supports that these cells can synthesize a variety of
   extracellular matrix components in vitro, suggesting an active
   participation in connective tissue remodeling. However, their possible
   role in extracellular matrix degradation is unknown. In this study the
   production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was examined in primary
   cultures of rat alveolar type II pneumocytes after 2 and 7 days in
   culture. Under basal conditions, at both periods type II cells expressed
   interstitial collagenase mRNA. The immunoreactive protein was detected
   both in the cells and in conditioned media, and collagenolytic activity
   was revealed after trypsin activation. Gelatinolytic activity was
   detected by zymography showing a relative molecular mass of similar to
   72 and 92 kDa (gelatinases A and B). Phorbol treatment increased
   collagenase and gelatinase activities. In addition, three alveolar
   epithelial cell lines were analysed for MMP production: MLE-12 (mice),
   L2 (rat), and A539 (human). The cell lines A549 and MLE-12 revealed
   collagenase and gelatinase A and B activities whereas the L2 cell line
   only exhibited gelatinase A activity, even after PMA induction. These
   findings demonstrate that alveolar epithelial cells synthesize in vitro
   several MMPs that confer on them the ability to degrade extracellular
   matrix and basement membrane components, a capacity of considerable
   importance for the remodeling of the stromal/epithelial interface. (C)

Abstract = {This study explores whether ecological factors, such as pollinators and
   pollen flow, or variation in pollen and ovule development account for
   the observed differences (approximately twofold) in the reproductive
   output of pin and thrum individuals of Erythroxylum havanense. The
   importance of ecological factors was assessed by means of comparison of
   the identity of pollinators and the rates of flower visitation, and by
   performing controlled hand pollinations and measurements of fruit set.
   In addition, we described the pollen and ovule development of thrum and
   pin individuals. Our results indicate that pollinators of E. havanense
   do not distinguish between floral morphs. The differences in fruit set
   between pin and thrum plants held even after hand pollination and,
   therefore, the observed differences in reproductive output between
   floral morphs of E. havanense cannot be explained in terms of
   asymmetrical pollen flow. There were no differences in the pattern of
   gynoecium development between the pin and thrum morphs, however
   androecium development showed marked differences between the morphs, and
   there was a resemblance between the developmental pathways leading to
   male sterility of the thrum morph of E. havanense with that of species
   with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS).},

Abstract = {Eucheira socialis (Westwood) occurs above 1,800 m in mountains
   throughout Mexico and has a remarkable suite of autapomorphies,
   including communal larval nests and a mean primary sex ratio of 70\%
   males. We gathered allozyme data for 31 loci from individuals within
   nests within populations and used hierarchical F statistics to assess
   population structure and relatedness at these levels. Allozyme variation
   was far lower than reported in most Lepidoptera, and was absent from the
   populations sampled from southern Mexico. Among 5 sample sites
   distributed throughout Mexico, differentiation was high (F-ST = 0.54),
   which is consistent with a history of interrupted gene flow. At lower
   hierarchical levels in the variable populations, we found significant
   excess heterozygotes within nests (F-IN = -0.15) and evidence for
   structuring within subpopulations (F-IS = 0.015, significantly greater
   than F-IN) Average relatedness among nestmates was r(NS) = 0.28, which
   is significantly less than r = 0.5. This is probably caused largely by
   interchange among nests on multinest trees.},

   better contrast between chromosome arms and NORs, which were preserved

   preparations treated sequentially for CBG banding/AgNO3 staining
   promoted complete decolorization of C+ regions, leading to `'reverse''

Abstract = {57 species of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) were found in four calcareous
   springs in the central region of Mexico. 6 belong to Centrales and 51
   belong to Pennales. Information for each species includes: general
   ecological characteristics, salinity, saprobity, pH, nutrients,
   temperature and known geographical distribution in Mexico. With respect
   to temperature, 24 of 31 species reported in the literature coincided
   with our values (20-27 degrees C, mesothermal or euthermal). 37 of 41
   species with published pH data have been reported as alkaliphilous,
   alkalibiontic or indifferent to pH, corresponding to conditions in the
   Huasteca. With respect to salinity 23 of the 36 species are reported
   from low salinity habitats (oligohalobous or halophilous). Lastly, with
   respect saprobity, 38 species with reports in the literature has been
   found in habitats with low concentrations of organic matter
   (mesosaprobic, oligosaprobic, saproxenous and saprophobic). The
   importance of these characteristics to use the species as ecological
   indicators is discussed.},

Abstract = {We studied patterns of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and colorimetric

   three putative subspecies (leconrei, macmillanorum, and arenicola).
   Haplotypes were shared between leconrei and macmillanorum, and we do not
   support recognition of the latter. However, haplotypes of arenicola
   differed bq 3.5\% sequence divergence from those of lecontei and
   macmillanorum, and we suggest that arenicola be recognized as a species.
   Colorimetric analyses of 105 specimens indicated that arenicola differed
   consistently from lecontei and macmillanorum, corroborating the mtDNA

Abstract = {We discuss the existence of ambiguities, or anomalies of fermionic
   nature as we call them, in the quantization of relativistic systems with
   odd Grassmann degrees of freedom. We propose in this work a way of
   avoiding such ambiguities in the case of relativistic quantum mechanics,
   by including the odd degrees of freedom into a generalization of the
   momentum, in a similar manner to the minimal coupling. We illustrate our
   results with some examples, including the Dirac oscillator as a typical
   case of the problems we are dealing with.},

Abstract = {Multi-band superconductors are analyzed and the relevance of overlapping
   energy bands to the high-T-c of these materials is studied. Within the
   BCS framework, a two band model with generalized Fermi surface
   topologies is developed. Values of the overlapped occupancy parameters
   for typical cuprate superconductors are obtained as a function of the
   ratio R and the effective coupling constant, lambda, in the
   weak-coupling limit. The overlap scale is of the order or lower than the
   cutoff (Debye) energy. The typical behavior of the isotope effect is
   obtained. As these superconductors have transition temperatures above
   the phonon barrier, the results of this approach are important to the
   generic understanding of the high-T-c superconducting mechanism.},

Abstract = {We analyze the mathematical formulations used by Newton in his

   intentionally omitted in all his book the use of the fluxional analysis
   that he developed. However, he could not avoid its use, at least in its
   conceptual frame, in some of the demonstrations he provided. The result
   is that his mathematical discourse in this book drifts from traditional
   geometry to fluxional theory (Calculus), being the central part a
   geometrical formulation of movement, or `'flowing geometry'', which lies
   in between the two former approaches.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present paper is to review the current knowledge
   about cholesterol gallstone disease. It is generally accepted that the
   formation of cholesterol gallstone requires three major pathogenic
   defects, namely, supersaturation, nucleation and crystal growth as well
   as disorder of gallbladder motility. The supersaturation is necessary
   but not sufficient to explain stone formation, It has been suggested
   that nucleation is the key factor for gallstone formation. However,
   those three factors are necessary for the formation of cholesterol
   gallstones, and the presence of just one or two factors does not lead to
   stones. We also touch briefly on the results from studies performed in
   Mexico in this area.},

Journal = {PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {98},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Germination of nondormant seeds of Manfreda brachystachya (Agavaceae)
   was analyzed at temperatures ranging from 11-35 degrees C. Maximum
   germination (95\%) occurred at 25 degrees C. An exponential sigmoid
   relationship was found between time and cumulative germination.
   Germination rate for every subpopulation (10-90\% germination) was
   estimated by means of a normal distribution analysis. The kurtosis
   indicated the amplitude of the range of temperatures where the highest
   germination rates were concentrated, and the skew indicated sharply
   inhibitory temperatures in the range of temperatures used. Based on
   analysis of the normal distribution models for each subpopulation, we
   calculated a theoretical function which described germination rate over
   the temperature range considered: F(T,x) = A x exp{[}-B(C-1)(2)] where A
   is the function that describes germination rate for each subpopulation
   (characterized by the percentage {[}x] at optimal temperature); B is a
   shape parameter, 1/(sigma(2)); and C is the ratio between each
   germination temperature (T) and the optimal germination temperature. The
   Gaussian curves were used to calculate thermal time, and base and
   ceiling temperatures. Germination thermal time ranged from 1 333 to 2
   373 degrees C h, and base and ceiling temperatures were 10.44 +/- 0.7
   degrees C and 39.54 +/- 0.7 degrees C, respectively. There was a linear
   relationship between thermal time and cumulative percentage of
   germination of the subpopulations. Based on fitted curves for each
   subpopulation, the use of a general model for all the subpopulations has
   been proven: F-g = A x exp{[}-5.9437(C-1)(2)], where changes in the
   curves for each subpopulation depended on temperature only.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the steady-state condensation process of a
   saturated vapor in contact with one side of a vertical thin plate,
   caused by an uniform cooling rate on the other surface of the plate. The
   effects of both longitudinal and transverse heat conduction in the plate
   are considered. The momentum and energy balance equations are reduced to
   a system of three differential equations with four parameters: the
   Prandtl (Pr) and Jakob (Ja) numbers, a nondimensional plate thermal
   conductivity alpha, and the aspect ratio of the plate epsilon. To obtain
   the evolution of the condensed layer thickness and the related
   temperature of the plate as a function of the longitudinal coordinate
   position, the coupled balance equations are integrated in the asymptotic
   limit Ja --> O, including the cases of very good and poor conducting
   plates. The results obtained indicate that the effect of the
   longitudinal heat conduction through the plate on the condensed layer
   thickness changes from a profile x(1/4) for a good conducting plate to
   x(1/3) for a poor conducting plate.},

Abstract = {Exposure of adult rats to 100\% O-2 produces a lethal injury by 72 h. We
   reasoned that matrix metalloproteinases participate in the pathogenesis
   of hyperoxic lung injury. To that end we studied the expression and
   activity of gelatinases A and B and interstitial collagenase in lung
   tissues and bronchoalveolar ravage fluids (BALF) of rats exposed to
   100\% oxygen for 60 h. Gelatin zymography of BALF samples revealed a
   similar to 72 kDa molecular species both in controls and oxygen-exposed
   animals. In addition, BALF from hyperoxic rats exhibited a 95-kDa
   gelatinase. Likewise, BALF total gelatinolytic and collagenolytic
   activities were significantly increased in oxygen-exposed rats. In situ
   hybridization revealed an increase in type IV collagenases as well as
   interstitial collagenase mRNAs in the oxygen-exposed lungs. The three
   enzymes were expressed by alveolar macrophages, and in variable degrees
   by interstitial and alveolar epithelial cells. Immunoreactive gelatinase
   B and collagenase paralleled the cell localization of the mRNAs but were
   also detected in the alveolar walls and interstitium. In situ zymography
   showed gelatinolytic activity in frozen sections of oxygen-exposed lungs
   but not in normal lungs. The upregulation of these metalloproteinases
   during acute exposure to 100\% O-2 suggests that they might contribute
   to hyperoxic lung damage through the degradation of extracellular matrix
   components.},

Abstract = {The ovarian follicles of Ctenosaura pectinata exhibit a clear seasonal
   cycle in morphology. Early in development, each oocyte is surrounded by
   a granulosa composed of a single layer of cuboidal or squamous cells and
   thin thecal layers. As folliculogenesis progresses, the granulosa
   becomes multilayered and composed of three distinct cell types. After
   vitellogenesis begins and active sequestration of yolk into the ooplasm
   is initiated, the granulosa is reduced to a single cell type. We
   observed a striking change in the appearance of the ooplasm during
   folliculogenesis. Early ovarian development is characterized by an
   ooplasm with homogeneously distributed fine fibrils, but as development
   progresses, the ooplasm contains dense clumps of fibers aggregated into
   distinctive bundles. The ooplasm displays further complexity in
   morphology as previtellogenic growth continues and as different regions
   exhibit various combinations of fibers and vacuoles. Yolk platelet
   formation is complex, with distinctive stages generating platelets with
   varying morphologies. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {In this work we analyse the Cherenkov effect for non-rotating extended

   radiated by the charge is equal to the work done by the radiation
   reaction force. Our results are equal to those obtained using other
   methods (see Buskirk F. R. and Neighbours J. R., Phys. Rev., 28 (1983)

   Chronic ERG recordings were obtained from juvenile instars of crayfish.
   Changes on the ERG amplitude rhythm produced when 30 min blue light

   showed advances in the early subjective night and delays in the late
   subjective night. These phase shiftings resemble the features of curves

Abstract = {We discuss the existence of ambiguities in the quantization of systems

   in the case of relativistic mechanics, which consists in including the
   odd degrees of freedom into a generalization of the momentum, that fully
   contains the anomalies. We consider this generalized momentum as the
   relevant variable to quantize, mentioning their gauge transformation
   properties. We illustrate our results with some examples. In particular,
   we discuss the Dirac oscillator as a typical case of the problems we are

Abstract = {The structure of the polysaccharide part of the lipopolysaccharide

   hexasaccharide units. Smith degradation of the native O-polysaccharide
   resulted in a polysaccharide with four sugar residues in the repeating
   unit. Information on the sequence of the native O-polysaccharide and the
   Smith-degraded product was obtained by two-dimensional-NMR techniques,
   namely heteronuclear-multiple-bond-connectivity and NOESY experiments.
   The structure of the repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide of E. coli
   strain O125, which has two adjacent branch-point residues, is

   the electrons are localized into a paramagnetic or ferromagnetic

Abstract = {The expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and

   in an experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis. Adult rats were exposed
   to 75\% oxygen during 10 weeks, and to 2.0 mg/kg of paraquat twice
   weekly. Rats were sacrificed at 2 days, and at 2 and 10 weeks after the
   first injection of paraquat. Lungs were fixed in 4\% paraformaldehyde
   and used for histology and immunohistochemistry. At 2 days the lungs
   showed a diffuse inflammation composed of a mixed polymorphonuclear and
   mononuclear cell infiltrate. Afterwards, the inflammatory process was
   predominantly mononuclear, and an increasing fibroblast proliferation
   was observed. Early inflammatory events (48 h) correlated with a
   moderate increased expression of ICAM-1, LFA, and CD11b/c in epithelial
   cells as well as a pronounced expression of ICAM-1 and CD11b/c in
   macrophages. At 2 and 10 weeks, there was a progressive increased
   expression of CD11b/c and ICAM-1 by macrophages, as well as of LFA in
   epithelial cells, and of ICAM-1 and CD49 by epithelial and interstitial
   cells. Lymphocytes showed a slight increased expression of LFA at 2
   weeks, and of CD49 at 2 and 10 weeks. These results suggest that
   macrophages expressing ICAM-1, CD11b/c, and CD49 are involved in the
   earlier and late phases of the disease whereas fibroblast and epithelial
   cells expressing ICAM-1 and CD49 might play a role in the cell
   interactions involved in the fibrotic phase.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study the conjugate heat transfer across a vertical
   wall separating two fluids at different temperatures. We present a
   classification of the solutions of the problem in terms of two main
   parameters; epsilon, the ratio of thickness to height of the wall and
   alpha, measuring the ratio of the thermal resistance of one of the
   boundary layers to the thermal resistance of the wail. Numerical and
   asymptotic solutions are presented for all possible values of alpha. We
   show that a maximum average Nusselt number or non-dimensional overall
   heat flux is attained for values of alpha much smaller than one, but
   still large compared with epsilon(2). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {An algorithm for the enhancement of digital images is described. The
   algorithm is based upon the analogy that may exist between the
   description of a macroscopic system composed of many particles, and a
   digital image composed of many pixels. The analogy assumes that the
   intensity in a digital image fluctuates, so that the algorithm takes
   into account that fluctuations must decrease to a minimum in such a way
   that an enhanced image may be thought of as an image in an equilibrium
   state, leading to a quantitative criterion to stop the enhancement
   process. This may be taken as the starting point of a computer aided
   vision system, the next step being the image segmentation leading to the
   identification of the various patterns forming the image and which is
   described in a forthcoming paper. (C) 1996 American Institute of

Title = {Habitat suitability study for the conservation of the volcano rabbit

Abstract = {1. The endangered Mexican volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) habitat
   relationship was investigated. Data, obtained from 137 sampling units in
   14 patches of the geographical distribution areas of the rabbit,
   included information on floristic composition, vegetation structure,
   terrain characteristics and human activities. The abundance of the
   volcano rabbit was measured in 685 subsampling units by pellet-counts
   and estimations of pellet-coverage.
   2. Two questions have been addressed in this paper: what is a good
   indicator of habitat type and which are the habitat factors that explain
   best the distribution of the volcano rabbit?
   3. Thirteen plant communities were identified. Terrain and landscape
   units were distinguished through aerial photograph interpretation and
   were verified in the field. By means of classical (parametric and
   non-parametric) and multivariate (Canonical Correspondence Analysis)
   statistical analyses, the most suitable, suitable and unsuitable habitat
   classes were detected.
   4. The results indicated that plant communities (F=4,14; P <0.0001) and
   landscape units (F=7,29; P <0.001) were adequate levels to distinguish
   habitat types for the rabbit.
   5. Plant communities of Festuca tolucensis and Trisetum
   altijugum-Festuca tolucensis attained the largest abundance of rabbits,
   followed by the communities Muhlenbergia quadridentata-Pinus hartwegii,
   Festuca tolucensis-Pinus hartwegii and Pinus sp.-Alnus firmifolia. The
   abundances of the volcano rabbit in the remaining plant communities were
   significantly less than in the communities mentioned above.
   6. These results suggest that the volcano rabbit shows strong
   preferences for subalpine habitat types.
   7. Soil moisture (r=-0.840), altitude (r=-0.756), grazing (r=-0.423) and
   burning (r=0.494) correlated significantly with the distribution and
   abundance of the volcano rabbit.
   8. These results are discussed in light of their role in the
   conservation of the volcano rabbit.},

Abstract = {The marine planktonic diatom Rhizosolenia robusta Norman is widely
   distributed in tropical and subtropical areas and occurs occasionally in

   The present study is based on light and electron microscopy of net
   plankton samples front several tropical and Subtropical locations.
   including Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Mexico and the Indian Ocean.
   Features unique for this species include Undulated and ribbed valves,
   the Structure Of the valve wall, the morphology of the process at the
   apex of each valve, the location and shape of the labiate structure, and
   the arrangement of the girdle hands. These features Support transfer to

   Hernandez-Becerril et Meave. Morphological variability includes Shape Of
   file cell and length of the external tube. The term `calyptra' is
   reintroduced for it structure analogous to the process of Rhizosolenia
   sensu stricto. The morphology of the complex labiate structure-external
   tube is discussed, and the term `conflatuportula' (United rimoportula)

Abstract = {Mitotic recombination induced by six alkylating agents has been studied
   in the wing-spot test of Drosophila melanogaster. The model mutagens
   chosen have different modes of action at the DNA level. These are: the
   direct-acting small alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), the
   small promutagens N-dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), and N-diethylnitrosamine
   (DEN), the bifunctional cross-linking alkylating agents mitomycin C
   (MMC), chlorambucil (CLA) and monocrotaline (MCT). Flies of the standard
   cross (flr(3)/TM3, Bd(S) females and mwh males) were used to produce the
   larvae to be treated. Three-day-old Drosophila larvae were exposed by
   chronic feeding for 48 h to three different concentrations of all six
   alkylating agents. Acute feeding for only 2 h was used in addition with
   DEN and MMC. Wings of the marker-heterozygous (mvh+/+flr(3)) as well as
   of the balancer-heterozygous (mwh+/TM3, Bd(S)) progeny were analysed.
   The ranking of the compounds with respect to their genotoxic potency,
   based on mwh clone formation frequency in marker-heterozygous wings,
   was: MMS > MMC > DMN > CLA similar to MCT > DEN. The ranking with
   respect to the induction of twin spots, which are produced by mitotic
   recombination exclusively, was: MMS > DMN > MMC > MCT > CLA > DEN. The
   quantitative determination of recombinagenic activity, based on mwh
   clone formation frequencies obtained in both types of wings, gave the
   following values: MMS, 93\%; MCT, 87\%; CLA, 80\%; MMC, 73\%; DMN, 67\%;
   DEN, 22\%. A clear relationship exists between the extent of
   N-alkylation of DNA and the efficiency of the monofunctional agents MMS
   and DMN as well of the bifunctional agents MCT, CLA and MMC to induce
   mitotic recombination. This contrasts with the ethylation of base oxygen
   atoms and the resulting lower efficiency of DEN to produce mitotic
   recombination.},

   mg.L(-1) and 1 mg.L(-1) BAP. Regeneration of shoots was readily achieved
   by transferring pieces of callus to fresh solid medium with the same
   composition. Shoots were induced to form roots upon transfer to medium
   with 0.1 mg.L(-1) NAA. Plantlets were successfully potted. Citologycal
   studies of root tips from regenerated plants revealed a normal diploid

Abstract = {We obtain the lowest energy 2D arrangements of atoms adsorbed on a
   hexagonal lattice, assuming rational coverage and a repulsive dipolar
   adsorbate-adsorbate interaction. To this end we exhaustively explore the
   ordered arrangements compatible with the coverage, including those that
   have multiatomic unit cells. For some coverages (theta=1/3, 1/4 and 1/7)
   we find a well defined ground state, and for others a nearly infinite
   degeneracy related to the possibility of creating dense arrays of linear
   defects with a negligible energy cost. We compare our results with some
   experimental determinations of surface structures in alkali overlayers
   on fcc (111) and hcp (0001) metal faces. Except for those systems that
   form islands, we have found agreement between our predicted ground
   states and experiment. Furthermore, no ordered structures with the
   coverages of our near degenerate states have been observed.},

Journal = {MICROBIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {The essential amino acid histidine is synthesized by organisms belonging
   to the three cell domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The
   biosynthetic pathway appears to be the same in all the organisms
   irrespective of complexity, and is a good example of the unity of
   biochemistry. Details of this process have only recently been
   elucidated. Because of the high metabolic cost for its synthesis, the
   histidine pathway is subject to multiple and tight control mechanisms
   which have been studied in detail in only a few species: Salmonella
   typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S.
   typhimurium and E. coli, the biosynthetic pathway is specifically
   controlled in response to the availability of histidine by two distinct
   mechanisms: (i) enzymatic feedback inhibition and (ii) transcription
   attenuation. In addition, the system is responsive to metabolic control.
   Moreover, a nonspecific mechanism operating during the elongation step
   of transcription has been proposed to modulate tire levels of
   transcription in response to the rate of protein synthesis. Finally, it
   has been recently discovered that his operon expression is regulated
   posttranscriptionally by a complex mechanism of segmental stabilization
   of regions of the native message. The cloning and sequencing of more
   than 60 his genes in more than 20 species has now made possible a
   detailed analysis of their structure, organization and evolution,
   revealing that major gene rearrangements (gene fusion, gene elongation,
   and gene duplication) have played an important role in shaping the
   pathway in the early stages of molecular evolution and also in its
   evolution in different microorganisms. Aside from the intrinsic
   importance of this metabolic pathway, this system fins been and is
   widely used to investigate fundamental aspects of molecular and cellular
   biology.},

Abstract = {In this study, plants of six species (Chamaecrista chamaecristoides,

   pes-caprae and Schizachyrium scoparium) which grow in the sand dunes of
   the Gulf of Mexico were experimentally buried with sand at different
   depths. For all species, burial increased plant vigour in terms of
   biomass and leaf area. In general, buried plants allocated more biomass
   towards the aerial parts (except in T. gouini, in which the reverse was
   true). The tested species exhibited good tolerance to sand burial. Their
   germination occurred during the period when sand movement was at its
   lowest. Growth form of species affected their ability to withstand
   burial. For example, shrubby species were the most tolerant ones and
   herbaceous plants the least. Such tolerance to burial seems to be
   related to local distribution of species in the dune system.},

Abstract = {We present an extensive study of the infrared (Delta V = 2) CO
   absorption bands in low-luminosity young stars at intermediate
   resolutions (R approximate to 1000), and at high resolution (R
   approximate to 17000) for a sub-sample. The bands are very common in
   YSOs and correlate well with SED class in the sense that Class II
   sources tend to show CO absorption while Class I sources do not. From
   the relative band strengths a lower limit on the CO excitation
   temperature of 2300 K is derived. The echelle spectra show that the
   majority of CO bandheads are broadened by less than 17 km s(-1) and
   point to a stellar photospheric origin rather than a disk; they also
   suggest that most YSOs are only slowly rotating. The band strengths are
   inversely correlated with the thermal infrared excess, which leads to a
   simple model in which the CO bands from the central PMS star are veiled
   by continuum emission from circumstellar dust.},

Abstract = {`The arrangement of compact chromatin of Go lymphocytes was studied in
   three-dimensional reconstructions of the ensemble of the chromatin and
   of individual compact chromatin bodies. Rat spleen was serially cut and
   sections were contrasted with procedures preferential for DNA. Electron
   microscopy images were digitized, processed, and displayed using a
   commercial software package, complemented by a system for
   three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis developed by us on an
   IBM-compatible microcomputer provided with an image acquisition board.
   The reconstructions showed a continuous layer of compact chromatin in
   contact with the nuclear envelope that prevents the automatic
   recognition of individual chromatin clumps. The ensemble of the
   arrangement of compact chromatin was found to be very similar in
   different lymphocytes. After morphological filtering procedures, the
   initial mass was divided into individual bodies of compact chromatin,
   which were tagged. Most of these bodies contact the nuclear envelope.
   The number of bodies as well as the number of contacts with the envelope
   are similar and correspond to a haploid number of chromosomes. The
   largest body is always the one containing nucleolus-associated
   chromatin. When the cell, has two nucleoli, the nucleolus-associated
   chromatin bodies contact the envelope in diametrically opposed areas.
   This feature was also described in rat liver cells. It is concluded
   that: (a) the individualized compact chromatin bodies do not correspond
   to an entire chromosome or to a pair of chromosomes; (b) the arrangement
   of compact chromatin is not identical in each Go lymphocyte, but there
   are patterns that are repeated with limited changes; and (c) there are
   common features that appear in different cell types of individuals of
   the same species.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {217-240},
Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the condensation process of a saturated Vapor
   in contact with one side of a vertical thin plate, caused by a forced
   flow on the other surface of the plate. The effects of both longitudinal
   and transversal heat conduction in the plate are considered. Due to the
   finite thermal conductivity of the plate, a longitudinal temperature
   gradient arises within it changing the mathematical character of the
   problem from parabolic to elliptic. The momentum and energy balance
   equations are reduced to a system of integro-differential equations with
   five parameters: the Prandtl (Pr-c) and a Jakob (J alpha) numbers, a
   non-dimensional plate thermal conductivity alpha, the aspect ratio of
   the plate epsilon and beta defined by the ratio of the thermal
   resistance of the condensed layer to the thermal resistance of the
   forced cooling how. In order to obtain the spatial evolution of the
   condensed layer thickness and the related temperature of the plate as a
   function of the longitudinal coordinate position, the coupled balance
   equations are integrated in the asymptotic limit J alpha --> 0,
   including the cases of very good and poor conducting plates. For finite
   values of the parameters alpha and beta, this paper shows that effect of
   the heat conduction through the plate modifies the classical Nusselt
   solution substantially. Two terms of the asymptotic expansions, for the
   limiting case of alpha --> infinity and finite beta, are enough to
   reproduce the temperature distribution and the condensed layer thickness
   evolution with high accuracy even for values of or of order unity.},

Abstract = {We study in this paper the steady-state ignition of a catalytic vertical
   plate immersed in a combustible gas. The set of governing equations are
   elliptic, including the energy equation for the plate as well as the
   balance equations for the laminar natural convective boundary layer. The
   influence of the longitudinal heat conduction through the plate is
   clarified, showing well-defined ignition and extinction conditions
   (S-shaped curve) for high activation energy The parameter that measures
   the influence of the longitudinal heat conduction is the heat conduction
   parameter alpha for moderate values of the nondimensional activation
   energy (Ze) of the overall reaction or <(alpha)over tilde> = alpha
   Ze(1/4) for high activation energies. Ze --> infinity. The longitudinal
   heat conduction is important for large values compared with unity of the
   heat conduction parameter alpha or <(alpha)over tilde>, for moderate or
   large values of the nondimensional activation energies, respectively.
   The heat conduction parameter can be very large compared with unity for
   metallic plates or very small compared with unity for ceramic plates.
   Numerical and asymptotic techniques have been used to evaluate the
   ignition conditions for very good (alpha, <(alpha)over tilde> -->
   infinity) and poor (alpha, <(alpha)over tilde> --> 0) conducting plates.
   Very well-defined ignition and extinction conditions are obtained for
   large Values of alpha or <(alpha)over tilde> and large values of the
   nondimensional activation energy. For small Values of alpha or
   <(alpha)over tilde>, there is not an S-shaped curve. The catalytic
   ignition is easier to achieve as the value of alpha increases.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {41},
Number = {6},
Pages = {760-774},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The available sequences of genes encoding the enzymes associated with
   histidine biosynthesis suggest that this is an ancient metabolic pathway
   that was assembled prior to the diversification of the Bacteria,
   Archaea, and Eucarya. Paralogous duplications, gene elongation, and
   fusion events involving different his genes have played a major role in
   shaping this biosynthetic route. Evidence that the hisA and the hisF
   genes and their homologues are the result of two successive duplication
   events that apparently took place before the separation of the three
   cellular lineages is extended. These two successive gene duplication
   events as well as the homology between the hisH genes and the sequences
   encoding the TrpG-type amidotransferases support the idea that during
   the early stages of metabolic evolution at least parts of the histidine
   biosynthetic pathway were mediated by enzymes of broader substrate
   specificities. Maximum likelihood trees calculated for the available
   sequences of genes encoding these enzymes have been obtained. Their
   topologies support the possibility of an evolutionary proximity of
   archaebacteria with low GC Gram-positive bacteria. This observation is
   consistent with those detected by other workers using the sequences of
   heat-shock proteins (HSP70), glutamine synthetases, glutamate
   dehydrogenases, and carbamoylphosphate synthetases.},

Abstract = {A high-temperature origin of life has been proposed, largely for the
   reason that the hyperthermophiles are claimed to be the last common
   ancestor of modern organisms. Even if they are the oldest extant
   organisms, which is in dispute, their existence can say nothing about
   the temperatures of the origin of life, the RNA world, and organisms
   preceding the hyperthermophiles. There is no geological evidence for the
   physical setting of the origin of life because there are no
   unmetamorphosed rocks from that period. Prebiotic chemistry points to a
   low-temperature origin because most biochemicals decompose rather
   rapidly at temperatures of 100 degrees C (e.g., half-lives are 73 min
   for ribose, 21 days for cytosine, and 204 days for adenine).
   Hyperthermophiles may appear at the base of some phylogenetic trees
   because they outcompeted the mesophiles when they adapted to lower
   temperatures, possibly due to enhanced production of heat-shock
   proteins.},

Abstract = {Changes in ovarian histology during the reproductive cycle of the
   viviparous lizard Sceloporus torquatus torquatus are described. In
   general, the variation in follicular histology observed during the
   seasonal cycle is similar to that of other lizards. Sceloporus t.
   torquatus exhibits a cycle in which small, previtellogenic follicles
   exist in the ovary from December to August. Vitellogenesis occurs
   between September and November, followed by ovulation from late November
   to early December. Parturition occurs the following spring. After
   ovulation, the remaining follicular cells form the corpus luteum and
   luteolysis did not occur until April-May. Follicular atresia is commonly
   observed in previtellogenic follicles with polymorphic granulosa, but
   occurs less frequently in follicles during late vitellogenesis. There
   are two germinal beds in each ovary. The yolk nucleus is evident in
   young oocytes as is a vacuolated ooplasma prior to vitellogenesis.
   Extensive polymorphism is observed in yolk platelets. Mast cells and
   secretory cells are observed in the thecal layer of the follicular wall
   as are melanocytes in the ovarian stroma. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Homotopic grafts supplemented with nerve growth factor (NGF) speed the
   recovery from learning deficits observed following electrolytic lesions
   of the insular cortex in rats. NGF also reduces the time in which the
   activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is first detected inside
   the graft by histochemical techniques. It is not known whether this
   behavioral and biochemical recovery correlates with an advanced
   maturation of the cellular elements within the graft, presumably induced
   by NGF. To investigate the degree of maturation of neurons, glial cells
   and blood vessels in NGF-supplemented grafts, adult rats were lesioned
   electrolytically in the insular cortex, and homotopic embryonic grafts
   (E16) with or without NGF supplementation were transplanted into the
   lesion. Fifteen days post grafting, the rats were perfused and the
   brains stained using silver impregnation techniques. Our results showed
   that neuronal maturation, as evaluated through several morphometric
   parameters, was advanced in NGF-supplemented grafts when compared with
   other experimental groups. Furthermore, grafts supplemented with NGF
   also showed significant increases in the number of neurons,
   oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and blood vessels. These observations
   indicated that the addition of NGF to insular cortex grafts promoted the
   maturation of neuronal and glial elements within the graft. They also
   support the possibility that the advanced morphological maturation of
   insular cortex grafts supplemented with NGF underlies the accelerated
   functional and biochemical recovery of animals with lesions of the
   insular cortex.},

Abstract = {The environmental distribution, growth forms of the communities where

   The species is widely distributed environmentally. It grows best in
   places where a combination of gradient of factors gives extreme
   micro-conditions such as strong wave shock at high tide with dessication
   and high solar radiation at low tide or under the quiet conditions of
   high midlittoral shallow pools. Under these conditions it forms
   extensive growths becoming the dominant species. These growths can form
   isolated patches or they can be interrupted by erect thalli of different
   species. Chaetomorpha antennina (Bory) Kutz. and Chnoospora a minima
   (Hering) Papenfuss are its principal associated species. Two morphs are
   described in relation to the micro-conditions in which they are most
   frequently found.},

Abstract = {We investigated the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity of humpback
   whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, wintering off the Mexican Pacific coast
   and the Revillagigedo Islands. We amplified and sequenced a variable
   fragment of the mtDNA control region from skin samples of 65 whales and
   compared these with published sequences from whales in other regional
   habitats. Among the Mexican humpback whales, we distinguished eight
   haplotypes differing by 0.31-3.75\% along a consensus sequence length of
   320 base pairs. A diagnostic restriction site outside the consensus
   sequence identified a ninth common haplotype. A phylogenetic
   reconstruction of the control region sequences revealed two main
   groupings: an AE group, which is common throughout the North Pacific,
   and a CF group, which is closely related to haplotypes from the southern
   hemisphere. We found a significant degree of geographic subdivision in
   the wintering grounds of the eastern North Pacific. Within Mexico,
   whales off the Revillagigedo Islands are weakly but significantly
   differentiated from those of the Mexican Pacific coast. Our data also
   suggest that mtDNA haplotypes are clinally distributed along the
   American Pacific coast and we hypothesize that the present distribution
   of these lineages among humpback whales in the eastern North Pacific is
   probably associated with weather changes after the last glaciation.},

Abstract = {Ventral fluke patterns of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae were

   collected from 7 major breeding grounds worldwide and were ranked into
   categories 1 (white) through 5 (black) based on the proportion of white
   and black pigment on the ventral surface. Average coloration varied
   primarily between oceanic populations, with the Southern Ocean stocks
   (Area IV, western Australia, and Area V, eastern Australia)
   characterized by significantly more light-colored flukes, while the
   North Pacific subpopulations consisted of individuals with significantly
   more dark-colored flukes. Results of statistical analyses revealed that
   all populations differed significantly from one another in the
   distribution of pigmentation classes, with the exceptions of Hawaii vs
   Japan, Mexico vs Japan, Mexico vs Hawaii, eastern Australia vs western
   Australia, and West Indies vs Colombia. Results of pigmentation analyses

Abstract = {The replication of fibroblasts is thought to be controlled by exogenous
   growth factors mainly secreted by macrophages and epithelial cells.
   However, under standard culture conditions, lung fibroblasts are able to
   produce several growth factors, suggesting an autocrine pathway of
   proliferation. In this work, we examined the expression of
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-A) and PDGF-B messenger RNA (mRNAs)
   by fibroblasts derived from four human adult normal lungs and from two
   fibrotic lungs. Northern blot analysis showed that both normal and
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-derived fibroblasts expressed a 2.8
   PDGF-B/c-sis mRNA. This transcript was also observed as a minor form in
   human osteosarcoma cell line, used as control, which predominantly
   expressed a 4.0-kb PDGF-B mRNA. In two fibroblast cell lines, one
   fibrotic and one normal, the 4.0-kb transcript was also observed but was
   always weaker than the 2.8-kb mRNA. PDGF-A mRNA was not detected. By
   immunofluorescence, lung fibroblasts exhibited intracytoplasmic
   PDGF-like protein. Likewise, conditioned media from normal and IPF lung
   fibroblasts stimulated H-3-thymidine incorporation in BALE/c-3T3 cells
   that was significantly inhibited by anti-PDGF antibody. These results
   show that in vitro, some human lung fibroblasts express PDGF-B/c-sis
   mRNA, mainly an alternate 2.8-kb transcript, and produce PDGF-like
   protein.},

   ingestion rate of larvae of the white shrimp Penaeus setiferus fed
   diatoms Chaetoceros ceratosporum, flagellates Tetraselmis chuii and
   Artemia franciscana nauplii were analysed. Diatoms, flagellates and

   mL(-1), 0 to 4 x 10(3) cells mL (1), and 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2
   nauplii mL(-1), respectively. In three experiments, two of three types
   of food were maintained constant at concentrations of 30-40 x 10(3)
   cells mL(-1) (diatoms), 2 x 10(3) cells mL(-1) (flagellates) and 1
   Artemia nauplii mL(-1). The oxygen consumption in three experiments
   increased with larval stage, reaching maximum values in MIII except at
   lower feed concentrations. A maximum ingestion peak in MI was recorded
   in larvae fed diatoms, whereas that peak was observed in MII in larvae
   fed flagellates. The maximum ingestion rate of Artemia nauplii was
   observed in MIII. Feed concentrations that produced an optimum metabolic
   rate as a consequence of equilibrium between ingested food and larval
   stages were obtained with 20 and 30 x 10(3) cells mL(-1) of C.
   ceratosporum, 2 and 3 x 10(3) cells mL(-1) of T. chuii, and 1.0 Artemia

Abstract = {Five groups of 20 juvenile instars of crayfish each, were submitted to
   five experimental photoperiodic cycles of different photophase and

   and weight were measured weekly, When the size and maturation of the
   first animals were adequate, all the animals were sacrificed, and the
   histological study of gonads was performed, The results indicate that
   animals submitted to a light-dark (LD) cycle 12:12 with light
   interruptions in the scotophase, showed the greatest gonadal induction.
   However the greatest growth induction appeared in animals submitted to
   control condition (LD 12: 12). These results could indicate for both
   functions two different models of photoperiodic induction.},

Abstract = {A phytosociological study of the juniper (locally called huito), pine
   (locally called sacch), pine-alder and fir forests of the Sierra de los
   Cuchumatanes and Cadena Volcanica in Guatemala was carried out. The
   Zurich-Montpellier approach was followed. In total 119 releves were
   sampled and the data were organised in phytosociological tables to
   distinguish vegetation clusters. TWINSPAN was used to evaluate major
   differences among plant communities. Seven zonal plant communities were
   distinguished and described, namely: (1) Relbunium microphyllum-Agrostis
   tolucensis, (2) Werneria nubigena-Agrostis exserta, (3) Lachemilla
   vulcania-Pinus hartwegii, (4) Holodiscus argenteus-Pinus hartwegii, (5)
   Hypnum cypressiforme-Juniperus standleyi, (6) Agave hurtei-Alnus
   firmifolia and (7) Sabazia pinetorum-Abies guatemalensis. This paper
   provides a thorough floristic characterisation of each community and
   outlines the major anthropogenic activities. To conclude, ecologic and
   floristic (dis)similarities between plant communities of the study area
   and those of Central Mexico, like the different altitudinal distribution
   of fir forests and the establishment of mid-successional communities
   such as the Agave hurteri-Alnus firmifolia were discussed.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS},
Year = {1995},

Abstract = {Two arsenic compounds, sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and sodium arsenate
   (Na2HAsO4), were tested for their possible genotoxicity in germinal and
   somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. For germinal cells, the
   sex-linked recessive lethal test (SLRLT) and the sex chromosome loss
   test (SCLT) were used. In both tests, a brood scheme of 2-3-3 days was
   employed. Two routes of administration were used for the SLRLT: adult
   mole injection (0.38, 0.77 mM for sodium arsenite; and 0.54, 1.08 mM for
   sodium arsenate) and larval feeding (0.008, 0.01, 0.02 mM for sodium
   arsenite; and 0.01, 0.02 mM for sodium arsenate). For the SCLT the
   compounds were injected into males. Controls were treated with a
   solution of 5\% sucrose which was employed as solvent. The somatic
   mutation and recombination test (SMART) was run in the w(+)/w eye assay
   as well as in the mwh +/+ flr(3) wing test, employing the standard and
   insecticide-resistant strains, in both tests, third instar larvae were
   treated for 6 hr with sodium arsenite (0.38, 0.77, 1.15 mM), and sodium
   arsenate (0.54, 1.34, 2.69 mM). In the SLRLT, both compounds were
   positive, but they were negative in the SCLT. The genotoxicity of both
   compounds was localized mainly in somatic cells, in agreement with
   reports on the carcinogenic potential of arsenical compounds. Sodium
   arsenite was an order of magnitude more toxic and mutagenic than sodium
   arsenate. This study confirms the reliability of the Drosophila in vivo
   system to test the genotoxicity of environmental compounds. (C) 1995

Abstract = {We present herein an improved method for the use of osmium ammine in a
   Feulgen-type reaction for specific staining of DNA at EM level and an
   analysis of its Schiff-type reagent behaviour. The activation of osmium
   ammine to a Schiff-type reagent (so far routinely performed by bubbling
   with gaseous SO2) can be accomplished by adding SO2-generating chemicals
   as for light microscopy. When used after HCl hydrolysis on epon or
   acrylate sections, activated osmium ammine behaves like a Schiff-type
   reagent, and the DNA staining can be selectively and completely
   abolished by aldehyde blocking agents. This preparation has the
   advantage of eliminating the use of gaseous SO2 thus rendering the
   technique more widely available to laboratories which cannot handle gas
   cylinders containing SO2.
   We recommend the use of osmium ammine in 8N acetic acid and 40mM sodium
   metabisulfite for 1 h at 37 degrees C for epon sections, and in 0.2N HCl
   and 0.2M metabisulfite for 30 min at room temperature for acrylate
   sections.},

   Within this model a small energy gap of the order of the Debye energy
   near the Fermi surface is proposed. An important physical requirement of
   the model is that the anomaly in the occupancy occurs simultaneously to
   the pair formation. The role of the variation of the ratio R = 2
   Delta(0)/kT(c) in the range 2 - 10 is studied. The phonon barrier can be
   overcomed and then obtain a good description of high-T-c superconductor
   cuprates in all the range of values for R suggested by experimental

Abstract = {This is a review of the anatomic localization evidences and the role
   played by opioid peptides in the processing of nociceptive and no
   nociceptive sensorial information in the spinal cord. Some per se
   constituted mechanisms in complex states generators are analyzed, such
   as allodynia, that is, no nociceptive sensorial stimuli producing pain.
   An experimental method is suggested by wich prolonged recordings are
   obtained (more than 2 h.) of unicellular activity of recorded neurons in
   the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of the complete and anesthesized rat
   (urethan, 1500 mg/kg). This preparation identifies the recorded neurons
   by means of the direct activation of the sensorial area. Changes in the
   sensorial codification are induced by means of the subcutaneous
   infiltration of carrageenan (200 ul at 1\%) in the same area. Results
   show an increase in the firing frequency of neurons, wich in a control
   situation respond only to soft tactile stimulation or to hair movement.
   This increase is what we consider as pain because it reverted with
   morphine administration (15 mg/kg iv). Nalaxone administration (1 mg/kg
   iv) increased the frequency eighty minutes after carrageenan
   infiltration. Data has been obtained from this experimental approach,
   reproducing the allodynia phenomena and indicating that it is mediated
   by the opioid system.},

Abstract = {The male reproductive cycle of this paedomorphic species that occurs
   only in Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico, was investigated by
   documenting changes in germinal cells during the spermatogenic cycle.
   Cysts of germ cells divide synchronously to complete spermatogenesis
   during September through December, with the proportion of evacuated
   cysts or cysts containing spermatozoa increasing during this period. The
   chromatin changes during prophase I of meiosis reveal the usual
   leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene stages. A basal body at
   the caudal end of the spermatozoan head connects to the flagellum. After
   spermiation, empty cysts contain a granular substance. Spermatogenesis
   in this species follows an annual cycle like other north temperate
   salamanders, rather than the continuous spermatogenesis of some tropical
   salamanders. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Leukotriene C4 (LTC4), a mediator generated by a variety of inflammatory
   cells, participates in several physiological and pathological processes.
   It has been shown that LTC4 stimulates collagen synthesis by
   fibroblasts, suggesting a role in collagen turnover. However, the
   possible effect of this mediator on collagen degradation has not been
   examined. In this study we explored the role of LTC4 in the modulation
   of fibroblast interstitial collagenase and TIMP-1. Confluent cultures of
   three human normal lung fibroblast cell lines, and one derived from
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) were exposed to LTC4 0.1, 1 and 10
   nM, and to IL-1 beta as positive control. Collagenase and TIMP mRNAs
   expression were analyzed by Northern blot followed by densitometric
   scanning. Immunoreactive procollagenase was detected by immunoblot, and
   collagenase activity was measured using {[}H-3]collagen. Our results
   showed that LTC4 enhanced several-fold collagenase mRNA expression in
   collagenase-producing fibroblasts, and induced the expression of the
   enzyme mRNA in collagenase-nonproducing fibroblasts, both in normal and
   IPF derived cell lines. LTC4 1 nM induced the highest response.
   Collagenolytic activity and immunoreactive collagenase paralleled
   collagenase mRNA expression. Interestingly, simultaneous exposure of
   fibroblasts to LTC4 plus IL-1 failed to show additive effects. Moreover,
   in two cell lines the combination resulted in a decrease of collagenase
   mRNA expression compared with both mediators separately. TIMP mRNA
   levels were not significantly modified by LTC4, nor IL1 beta. Our
   findings suggest that LTC4 plays a role in the modulation of fibroblast
   collagenase, and it may participate in extracellular matrix remodeling
   during lung inflammation.},

Journal = {VEGETATIO},

Abstract = {The concept of Megamexico as a phytogeographic unit has been introduced
   by Rzedowski (1991) on the basis of distribution patterns of genera.
   Until now precise information on the resemblance between plant
   communities in the proposed Megamexico was scarce. This
   phytosociological study documents the affinities between plant
   communities within Megamexico, based on studies from mountain ranges in
   Mexico (Sierra Chichinautzin, Sierra Nevada) and Guatemalan mountain
   ranges (Sierra de los Cuchumatanes, Cadena Volcanica). Data, collected
   in the style of Braun-Blanquet during extensive fieldwork, were pooled
   into a single data set, and analyzed by using (1) TWINSPAN, for plant
   community classification, (2) ordination (DCA), (3) alpha log series
   biodiversity-index to measure intergroup diversity, and (4) information
   on the altitudinal distribution of the vegetation belts. Classification
   showed that four communities were common to the two groups of mountain
   ranges, namely, alpine bunchgrassland, pine forest, fir forest and mixed
   forest. Along the altitudinal gradient Mexican communities are
   distributed 200 m higher than their Guatemalan equivalents. This appears
   to be an illustration of the `Massenerhebungseffekt'. DCA showed that
   the first axis represents a set of minor differences of closely related
   ecological factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and the second a
   humidity gradient. The biodiversity index showed that the Mexican mixed
   forest was significantly more diverse than the Guatemalan mixed forest.
   From the present results, ecological conditions among mountain ranges in
   Megamexico differed significantly. To conclude, phytogeographical units
   in Megamexico can better be defined on basis of both historical and
   ecological characteristics of the communities.},

Abstract = {Distribution and population size of the volcano rabbit or zacatuche

   1986 and 1989. Rabbits also were censused directly from horseback along
   29 line transects in October 1988. There was a significant correlation
   between the mean number of latrines and mean number of rabbits sighted
   within each of four categories of abundance. Spatial distribution was
   mapped based on these categories of abundance. Mean size of populations
   of volcano rabbit was estimated at 6,488 individuals (range of
   2,478-12,120). The lower value (2,478) should be used for conservation
   efforts. Most volcano rabbits occurred at 3,150-3,400 m elev., mainly in

Abstract = {A small assemblage of fossil legume fruits, leaf fragments, and leaflets
   has been recovered from the Tertiary (Oligocene) `'Los Ahuehuetes''
   flora near the town of Tepexi de Rodriguez, Puebla, in south-central
   Mexico. Five legume fruits are described and compared with fruits of
   extant genera. Four fruit types were identified as belonging to the
   modern genera Prosopis (Mimoseae; Mimosoideae), Mimosa (Mimoseae;
   Mimosoideae), Lysiloma (Ingeae; Mimosoideae),and Sophora (Sophoreae;
   Papilionoideae). Another fruit exhibits a combination of characters
   unknown among extant legumes, and although superficially similar to some
   species of Papilionoideae, it represents an extinct genus. The four
   identified genera are diverse in the extant vegetation of Mexico; in
   fact, Mexico represents an important area of distribution for them. The
   presence of Prosopis, Mimosa, Lysiloma, and Sophora in the fossil flora
   of Puebla documents the occurrence of these genera in this part of their
   present area of distribution by the Oligocene. The climatic affinities
   of modern species of Mimosa, Lysiloma, and Sophora are so varied as to
   preclude any useful paleoclimatic inference. Prosopis is regularly
   associated with arid environments; however, the genus has been reported
   from fossil localities where humid conditions prevailed. This
   observation, together with the assemblage of plants that co-occur in the
   Los Ahuehuetes flora, suggests that plant communities of the past may
   have been composed, at least partly, of elements that today are
   associated with different habitats and environmental conditions. The
   fossil legume fruits from Los Ahuehuetes flora add to the previously
   known diversity of Leguminosae by the Tertiary, confirm tropical America
   as one of the important areas of radiation and diversification for
   Leguminosae, and contribute to the knowledge of Tertiary floras of
   southern North America.},

Abstract = {The effective dielectric response of a system of spherical inclusions
   embedded in an otherwise homogeneous matrix has been calculated using,
   in the Maxwell Garnett formula, a renormalized polarizability instead of
   the bare one (Phys. Rev. B 38, 5371 (1988)). This renormalized
   polarizability was given as a functional of the two- and three-particle
   distribution functions and results were presented for a very crude
   approximation of the three-particle distribution function. Here we
   extend these results and analyze the effects of the three-particle
   correlations by using the best available form of this functional. We
   compare our results with other theoretical approaches and recent
   numerical simulations.},

Abstract = {We have examined the occurrence and cellular localization of
   interstitial collagenase and TIMP-1 mRNAs in a model of granuloma
   induced by carrageenin in guinea pigs. Granulomas were studied at 4, 7,
   10, and 14 days after carrageenin injury using a combined protocol for
   in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. Antivimentin monoclonal
   antibody was used to identify fibroblasts. Avidin-FITC and Texas red
   horse antimouse IgG were employed for detection of probes and antibody,
   respectively. Our results showed that during the extracellular matrix
   deposit phase (4 and 7 days), interstitial collagenase and TIMP-1 mRNAs
   were expressed only by fibroblasts as demonstrated by the colocalization
   of mRNA and vimentin. By contrast, during the initiation of the
   resorptive phase (10 and 14 days), fibroblasts and vimentin-negative
   cells, probably macrophages, expressed collagenase and TIMP-1. This
   study suggests that fibroblasts are the cell type expressing
   interstitial collagenase and TIMP-1 mRNA during all phases of the
   evolution of carrageenin granuloma and that macrophages, by contrast,
   express the mRNA for the enzyme and the inhibitor exclusively in the
   degradative phase. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {Results for resistance versus temperature, differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), Mossbauer spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility
   measurements in a Ti50Ni47Fe3 sample are presented. The resistance
   versus temperature curve shows a sharp increase at 245K and then rises
   slowly until a maximum is attained at almost-equal-to 150K. The DSC
   curve also exhibits a peak at the former temperature. The room
   temperature Mossbauer spectrum consists of a single line. As the
   temperature is lowered to 270K, a small asymmetric quadrupole doublet
   appears. The isomer shift and quadrupole splitting values of this
   doublet increase with decreasing temperature until almost constant
   values are achieved at temperatures almost-equal-to 100K. The magnetic
   susceptibility curve shows a sharp decrease that begins at 255K and then
   an unexpected increase at 90K. We relate these observations with a
   charge density wave-driven premartensitic transition in this system, and
   with the final martensitic phase.},

Abstract = {Multivariate analysis was used to describe the composition and
   distribution of vegetation types on the slopes of the volcanoes Tlaloc
   and Pelado, Mexico. These volcanoes are situated in the transitional
   zone between the Holarctic and Neotropical floristic regions, which
   offers a partial explanation for the relatively high alpha and beta
   diversities. Previous research argued that human activities, i.e.
   burning and razing, rather than abiotic factors, play a major role in
   determining the distribution and floristic composition of the
   vegetation. TWINSPAN, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis were used to test this hypothesis. Floristic and
   environmental data from 138 releves and seven explanatory environmental
   variables were included: elevation, soil depth, soil moisture,
   percentage litter cover, percentage cover of bare ground, burning and
   grazing were included in the analysis. Soil moisture and elevation
   accounted for ca. 63 \% of the residual inertia and none of the
   remaining explanatory variables proved to be correlated significantly
   with the first two axes. The present results suggest that burning and
   grazing operate on a finer scale. In conclusion, soil moisture and
   elevation are the most relevant variables to explain the distribution of
   the vegetation under study.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the cooling process of a vertical thin plate caused
   by a free convective flow, taking into account the effects of both
   longitudinal and transversal heat conduction in the plate. Due to the
   finite thermal conductivity of the plate, a longitudinal temperature
   gradient arises within it, which prevents any similarity solution in the
   boundary layer, changing the mathematical character of the problem from
   parabolic to elliptic, for large values of the Rayleigh number. The
   energy balance equations are reduced to a system of three differential
   equations with two parameters: the Prandtl number and a non-dimensional
   plate thermal conductivity alpha. In order to obtain the evolution of
   the temperature of the plate as a function of time and position, the
   coupled balance equations are integrated numerically for several values
   of the parameters, including the cases of very good and poor conducting
   plates. The results obtained, are compared with an asymptotic analysis
   based on the multiple scales technique carried out for the case of a
   very good conducting plate. There is at the beginning a fast transient
   in non-dimensional time scale of order alpha-1 followed by a slow
   non-dimensional time scale of order unity, which gives the evolution of
   the cooling process. Good agreement is achieved even for values of the
   conduction parameter alpha of order unity. The asymptotic solution
   allows us to give closed form analytical solution for the plate
   temperature evolution in time and space. The overall thermal energy of
   the plate decreases faster for smaller values of alpha.},

Abstract = {The interphase nucleus of the cells of several tissues of Lacandonia
   schismatica was studied using electron microscopy cytochemical and
   immunocytochemical methods. The EDTA staining procedure, preferential
   for RNP, contrasted the Lacandonia granules and perichromatin fibrils.
   These granules were found to be relatively resistant to RNAse
   hydrolysis, but they were easily digested if RNAse treatment was carried
   out after a short hydrolysis with pronase. Bismuth oxynitrate stained
   granular structures about 17 nm in diameter and the periphery of a few
   Lacandonia granules. The anti-snURNPs bound to RNP-containing fibrils in
   the perichromatin and interchromatin space and also to the periphery of
   some Lacandonia granules. Immunolabeling of DNA demonstrated numerous
   filaments of extended chromatin in the perichromatin and interchromatin
   spaces which were closely related to, Lacandonia granules. These
   observations suggested that Lacandonia granules are equivalent to
   Balbiani ring granules of nuclei with polytene chromosomes and to
   perichromatin granules of other plant and animal nuclei. The small
   number of Lacandonia granules labeled in their periphery by anti-snURNP
   mAb were interpreted as being immature granules in the process of
   formation. The external or annular part of the ring-shaped structures is
   heavily labeled by anti-URNP mAbs but scarcely stained by the EDTA
   procedure. These features indicate that this region contains abundant
   proteins associated with snURNAs but probably little snURNAs. The
   synaptonemal-like complexes previously found in the interphase nuclei of
   Lacandonia are formed by two parallel masses of compact chromatin, which
   react with anti-DNA, and a central clear space crossed by fiber. Most of
   these fibers do not react with tests for DNA or RNA and are probably
   composed of proteins. The EDTA procedure contrasts some fibrils at the
   internal aspect of the masses of compact chromatin, suggesting the
   presence of remnants of the lateral element of a synaptonemal complex.},

Abstract = {The localization of estradiol receptor (ER) in various tissues and their
   distribution in sub-cellular compartments were studied by means of
   immunogold-electron microscopic methods using a site-directed polyclonal
   antibody developed against a peptide from the DNA binding site of ER.
   This method was used to determine the presence and localization of ER in
   tissues and cells of male and female reproductive and non-reproductive
   organs. In the female reproductive tract, endometrial cells and the
   cells of the corpus luteum were found to contain ER. In non-reproductive
   organs of both sexes the following cell types showed significant
   labeling: hepatocytes, epithelial duodenal cells, striated muscle
   fibers, cells of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney,
   lymphocytes, neurons, and adipose cells. Alveolar epithelial cells were
   studied only in female specimens and were labeled by the anti-ER.
   Prostatic and epididymal epithelial cells were found to be labeled in
   the male reproductive organs. In all these cells a higher density of
   label was found in the nucleus, especially in the space between the
   clumps of compact chromatin, as was previously found in epithelial
   endometrial cells. These results suggest that estradiol exerts its
   effects through a common nuclear mechanism in cells of male and female
   reproductive and non-reproductive organs.},

Abstract = {In this paper we record the native parasitoids associated with
   Anastrepha fruit flies collected in a native tropical community from Los
   Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 1600 puparia of Anastrepha were
   recovered from infested fruits of ten different host plants. From these
   puparia we obtained 218 Hymenopteran parasitoids representing the
   following species: Doryctobracon areolatus (Szepligeti), Utetes
   (Bracanastrepha) aff. ananstrephae (Viereck), Doryctobracon crawfordi
   (Viereck), Opius hirtus (Fischer), Microcrasis n, sp., Nealiolus n. sp.
   (all Braconidae) ; Odontosema n. sp. and Lopheucoila sp, (Cynipidae).
   The most abundant and frequently encountered parasitoid species observed
   during this study was D. areolatus, representing 59.2 \% of all
   recovered parasitoids. The analysis of different infestation rates in
   fruits regarding to degree of parasitization in these Anastrepha species
   suggest they are not cell-elated, meanwhile some host plant
   characteristics such as fruit size, could play an important role in
   influencing rates of parasitization.},

Abstract = {The notion that comets supplied the primitive Earth with the requisite
   chemical species for the process of chemical evolution, which is widely
   held to have led to the origin of life on Earth, has now gained
   considerable intellectual momentum since its first formulation in 1961.
   In fact, in the fall of 1991, the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire
   hosted a well attended scientific meeting devoted solely to the
   discussion of this topic, entitled Comets and the Origins and Evolution
   of Life {[}see Special Issue of Origins of Life, P.J. Thomas (ed), vol.
   21(5-6)]. As a result of the above meeting, the recently completed
   COSPAR/World Space Congress Symposium on Extraterrestrial Organic
   Chemistry and the Origins of Life, and numerous independent reports, the
   role of comets in the Earth's biogenesis has been thoroughly addressed
   in the literature. At this time, in light of a few recent findings, we
   present here a concise review of this topic together with a brief
   discussion of the possible role of cometary material in the origin of
   life elsewhere in the Universe.},

   were pair-fed. Urine was collected daily, and the rats were sacrificed
   on day 10. PAN-nephrotic rats had proteinuria (days 3-10), high urinary
   Cu (days 1, 2, 4-10) and Zn (days 3-10) excretion. On day 10, nephrotic
   rats had: (a) albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, high urine
   and low serum levels of ceruloplasmin; (b) low Cu and Zn serum levels;
   (c) high clearance and fractional excretion of Cu and Zn, and (d) low
   kidney and liver Cu content and essentially normal tissue Zn levels. The
   alterations in Cu metabolism were more intense than those in Zn
   metabolism. Urine Cu and Zn showed a positive correlation Ceruloplasmin
   with urine total protein on days 3-10 which suggests that high urinary
   excretion of Cu and Zn may be due to the excretion of its carrier
   proteins. In conclusion, these rats did not show a typical Zn deficiency
   but a clear decrease in Cu in the liver and kidney.},

Year = {1994},

Abstract = {Aromatic amines represent a category of classical environmental hazards
   which require biotransformation in order to exert their mutagenic and
   carcinogenic effects. The mutagenic activity of several aromatic amines
   was tested by means of the w/w(+) somatic assay of Drosophila
   melanogaster employing a wild-type strain Leiden Standard (LS) and an
   insecticide-resistant stock Hikone-R (HK-R). Four
   monocyclic-ortho-anisidine (O-AN), ortho-toluidine (O-TO),
   2,4-diaminoanisole (2,4-DAA) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (4-N-o-PDA),
   and one bicyclic- 4,4'-oxidianiline (4,4'-ODA) aromatic amines were
   tested by chronic exposure. Two separate experiments were run, and
   concurrent controls were treated with the solvent mixture. Results show
   that the ortho-anilines (O-AN and O-TO) were active in the assay, while
   the diamines containing a methoxy (2,4-DAA) or a nitro group (4-N-o-PDA)
   were inactive. The bicyclic aromatic amine, 4,4'-ODA, was the most
   potent. The genotoxic responsiveness of both strains was very similar.

   with sinusoidal and the other with a piecewise uniform distribution of
   heating. In the first case, three ordinary differential equations
   decouple from an infinite set. Transition to chaos is similar to that
   for a toroidal geometry, that is through subharmonic cascade. In the
   second case a coupled infinite set of differential equations governs the
   systems. The stability region in parametric space decreases continuously
   as the number of modes considered is increased, showing that the system
   in this case is intrinsically unstable. Onset of chaos is through
   quasi-periodicity.},

Abstract = {Genetic heterogeneity in response to genotoxic carcinogens requiring
   metabolic conversion has been studied in Drosophila, using seven
   different genotypes in combination with the w/w+ eye mosaic assay for
   mitotic recombination. The set of tester strains examined consisted of
   four wild-type laboratory strains (Berlin-K, BK; Oregon-K, OK; Leiden-S,
   LS; and 91-C), and three DDT-resistant strains (91-R; Hikone-R, HR; and
   Haag-79, HG). Drosophila larvae heterozygous for the wild-type report
   gene w+ were exposed to benz{[}a]anthracene (BA), benzo{[}a]pyrene (BP),
   9,10-dimethylanthracene (DA), monocrotaline (MC), N-nitrosodimethylamine
   (DMN) or vinyl bromide (VBr). The primary conclusion regarding this
   study is the up to 60-fold variation between different genotypes in
   mosaic spot frequencies induced by those procarcinogens and the
   non-existence of just one genotype to function as a `super-strain' in
   the activation of different classes of procarcinogens. By contrast, the
   seven Drosophila strains show a similar response to the direct-acting
   agent methyl methanesulphonate. Among the six procarcinogens selected
   for this study, DMN and MC are readily detectable in all the distinct
   genotypes. Less satisfactory in terms of test performance are the either
   negative or weak test responses with BA in all four-wild type strains
   (LS, BK, OK and 91-C), and the weakly positive results for vinyl bromide
   in LS, BK and OK. The best overall test response was provided by strains
   HG and HR. It is concluded that the combined application of strains HG
   and HR safely and reliably should detect somatic cell recombinagens in
   the Drosophila w/w+ system. Addition of a third tester strain is not
   suggested by the test results obtained so far.},

   17-oxogrindelic acid reduced the germination and radicle growth of
   Schizachyrium scoparium and Leptochloa dubia, two native sandhill
   grasses, but had no significant effects on germination and only a slight
   stimulatory effect on radicle growth of Rudbeckia hirta and Lactuca
   sativa. Mixtures of 17-oxogrindelic acid with an equimolar mixture of
   three C. pauciflosculosa sesquiterpenes, (+)-curlone,
   (+)-sesquiphellandrene and (-)-alpha-trans-bergamontene, did not enhance

Abstract = {The distribution of DNA in synaptonemal complexes of rat and mouse

   Some labeled fibrils connecting the lateral elements with the central
   element were observed associated with recombination nodules or near
   them. However, other labeled fibrils in the space between lateral
   elements did not appear to present any relationship to recombination
   nodules. The immunocytochemical approaches used here confirmed the
   presence of significant amounts of DNA in the lateral elements as
   previously indicated by preferential DNA staining methods. Furthermore,
   our findings support the view that recombination nodules are the site of

Abstract = {Tidal pools in the Mexican Tropical Pacific coast have received
   relatively little attention in spite of their considerable richness in
   species and wide distribution in the region.
   This paper presents the first characterization of the algal flora of
   this region. It analyzes the number and composition of species of the
   tidal pools of six localities with regard to geographical distribution
   and its seasonal variations as well as tidal level. 97 species are
   reported, 25 Chlorophyta, 23 Phaeophyta, 34 Rhodophyta and 15
   Cyanophyta.
   Of that total of species, 63\% were found in one locality, 23.7\% in
   two, 11.3\% in three and 1\% in 4 or 5 localities. Not one species was
   common to all of the pools.
   The highest number of species was found on pools of the middle and low
   intertidal where the Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Phaeophyta were the
   most abundant algae. Cyanophyta was more common in the supralittoral and
   high intertidal pools.},

Abstract = {In this work we obtain the exact non linear equation of motion,
   including radiation reaction, for a charge moving in an isotropic,
   homogeneous and linear medium. From this equation we recover the known
   results for the dynamics of charges in vacuum and discuss the involved
   approximations. Using the hypothesis of uniform motion in the exact non
   linear equation we obtain the usual results of the Cherenkov effect.
   Also we analyze several conceptual points in order to get a better
   understanding of the Cherenkov effect. We study the energy balance and
   show explicitly the existence of an external force to avoid a
   contradiction with the electromagnetic theory; we show that, in this
   case, the charge behaves as a transducer transforming completely
   mechanical work into radiation. We also discuss the physical origin of
   the Cherenkov radiation, giving an explanation why there is radiation
   even when the charge is in uniform motion.},

Title = {The effect of electrical stimulation on spermatophore regeneration in

Abstract = {The effect of electrical stimulation on the quality of P. setiferus
   sperm cells was studied during the regeneration of the spermatophore.
   The proportion of the animals that responded to electroejaculation was
   quantified and the number of live, abnormal and dead cells, as well as
   the relationship between the number of cells and body weight, were taken
   into consideration as indicators of the effect of manipulation during
   stimulation. It was found that electrical stimulation caused some degree
   of spermatophore expulsion in 78\% of the cases. Total expulsion of the
   spermatophores occurred in only 8.3\% of the cases. A logistic curve was
   adjusted to the relationship between the number of sperm cells and the
   weight of the shrimp. After regeneration no curve was adjusted to the
   relationship. Eighty per cent of the stimulated shrimp regenerated the
   spermatophore in a maximum of 168 h. Fifty per cent regeneration was
   obtained in 96 h after stimulation. A decrease in the number of live
   cells from 26.8 to 7.6 million and an increase in abnormal (from 0.02 to
   3.92 million) and dead (from no cells dead to 4.6 million) respectively,
   were registered for regenerated animals. Necrotic areas in 60\% of the
   ampulae of regenerated shrimps were also observed. Bacteria associated
   with the necrotic ampulae was observed when counting sperm. As the
   spermatophore of this species is complex, it is necessary to search for
   a way to reduce the stress produced by the handling of the ampulae so as
   to avoid altering the reproductive capacity of the shrimp.},

Abstract = {Using the procedure previously obtained by the authors, we obtain the
   specific heat of the two-dimensional generalized Ising model when
   reentrancy occurs. For the case of single reentrancy and when the two
   transition temperatures are similar (single degeneracy), then the
   specific heat behaves as DELTA2 ln Absolute value of DELTA. For the case
   of double reentrancy one has two possibilities: (i) Single degeneracy.
   The behavior of the specific heat is again DELTA2 ln Absolute value of
   DELTA. (ii) Double degeneracy. The behavior is now DELTA4 ln Absolute
   value of DELTA. When higher reentrancies occur there is the possibility
   of higher degeneracy in the values of the transition temperatures, in
   which case the specific heat behaves as DELTA(k) ln Absolute value of
   DELTA with k > 4. These results are obtained in general, i.e.
   independently of the details of the interactions between spins of the
   system. Therefore, we conclude that there is a breakdown in the
   universal behavior of the specific heat.},

   Thus, it is important to know and to evaluate the radon levels, among
   other radioactive elements present in enclosed environments such as
   caves (Gammage, 1990; Hunyadi et al, 1991), especially since those caves
   were also the dwellings and refuge of the predecessor of man.
   In this work we present radon level measurements inside some caves with

Abstract = {1. The effect of eyestalk ablation on the energy balance of male and
   female pink shrimp Penaeus notialis adults was determined.
   2. The effect of ablation on ingested food, assimilation efficiency,
   assimiliation and oxygen consumption in both sexes was evident. It was
   reflected in the scope for growth obtained.
   3. The ablation of the eyestalks of females caused an increase in
   respiratory rate and a decrease in metabolic level with respect to
   intact shrimps. An increase in the respiratory rate could mean an
   increase in the physiologically useful energy (PUE). The effect of
   ablation in males produced an increase in the metabolic level without
   increase in the PUE.
   4. Although ablation caused an increase in the amount of ingested food,
   assimilated energy and the scope for growth in both sexes, it Aas less
   marked in males (39\%) than in females (53\%).
   5. These results suggest that the ablation does not increase the
   efficiency of the processes related to maturity in males as has been
   demonstrated for females of pink shrimp P. notialis. These differences
   may be related to the reproductive characteristics of males of P.
   notialis which is highly efficient and accelerated in normal conditions.},

Abstract = {A two-step global reduced mechanism has been identified from a detailed
   starting mechanism to simplify descriptions of structure and extinction
   of hydrogen-air diffusion flames. Based on this two-step scheme and on
   results from previous numerical integrations of conservation equations,
   an asymptotic analysis is performed to derive analytical expressions for
   predicting extinction strain rates. The flame structure consists of
   three regions: a thin radical-production zone in which H atoms are
   generated by the global step 3H2 + O2 --> 2H2O + 2H whose rate is
   largely determined by a high-activation-energy chain-branching
   elementary reaction, flanked by two thick radical-consumption layers in
   which the H is consumed by the overall step H + H + M --> H-2 + M, the
   rate of which is controlled by different elementary reactions on the
   lean and rich sides. The structure is similar to the premixed-flame
   regime of diffusion-flame structure as defined by Linan with H-2 but not

Title = {GERMINATION RESPONSE TO TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, LIGHT AND DEPTH OF SOWING
   OF 10 TROPICAL DUNE SPECIES},

Abstract = {This study describes the germination responses of ten tropical dune
   species to several factors to which their seeds are exposed in the
   field. Species studied were: three sand dune endemics (Amaranthus
   greggii, Palafoxia lindenii, and Trachypogon gouini), three pantropical
   coastal species (Sesuvium portulacastrum, Sporobolus virginicus and
   Ipomoea stolonifera) and four cosmopolitan grasses also found inland
   (Panicum repens, Panicum maximum, Pappophorum vaginatum and Andropogon
   glomeratus). Six species germinated when. exposed to different constant
   temperatures. Four required temperature fluctuation (S. portulacastrum,
   P. lindenii, S. virginicus, P. repens). Light promoted germination of
   three species (S. Portulacastrum, P. vaginatum, P. lindenii). Species
   varied in their degree of sensitivity to salinity. Seeds of T. gouini, L
   stolonifera, S. portulacastrum, P. repens, P. maximum and P. vaginatum
   were able to germinate under some of the salinity concentrations. Not
   all species were able to recover after being transferred to distilled
   water. Seedling emergence was inhibited when seeds were buried. This
   response was related to depth and to seed size. S. portulacastrum and S.
   virginicus were the most affected. Nitrates only affected germination
   response of two species. Seed age promoted germination under a wider
   range of conditions. P. lindenii showed very heterogeneous responses
   depending on seed cohort. No dormancy mechanisms were found, other than
   a thermoperiod and/or light requirement for some of the species.
   Cosmopolitan grasses tolerated both sand burial and salinity, although
   the endemics were the most successful in emerging from sand burial;
   coastal pantropicals were very tolerant to high saline concentrations
   and recovered completely.},

Abstract = {A random-matrix analysis is presented for the simplest multiprobe
   system, a three-terminal device consisting of one-dimensional wires,
   that allows the study of the voltage drop along a disordered mesoscopic
   conductor.  The calculation of the actual statistical distribution of
   the measured voltage is reduced to quadratures.  This distribution is,
   in general, so wide that the voltage measured at the midpoint of a
   strongly disordered conductor of a given length falls, with appreciable
   probability, in the vicinity of the voltage of either terminal.  Under
   these circumstances the measured voltage cannot be regarded as a
   macroscopic variable in the usual sense.  One consequence of so wide a
   distribution is that in a four-terminal arrangement one may measure with
   nonzero probability an uphill voltage.  A very wide distribution is also
   obtained when the conductor in question is a perfect one and an ensemble
   of splitters that couple the conductor to the measuring probe is
   considered.  Striking nonlocal effects of a quantum-mechanical origin
   are also explicitly demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Thirty years ago it was suggested that comets impacting on the primitive

   volatiles, including some important precursors for prebiotic synthesis
   (Oro, 1961, Nature 190: 389). This possibility is strongly supported not
   only by models of the collisional history of the early Earth, but also
   by astronomical evidence that suggests that frequent collisions of
   comet-like bodies from the circumstellar disk around the star beta
   Pictoris are taking place. Although a significant fraction ofthe complex
   organic compounds that appear to be present in cometary nuclei were
   probably destroyed during impact, it is argued that cometary collisions
   with the primitive Earth represented an important source of both
   free-energy and volatiles, and may have created transient, gaseous
   environments in which prebiotic synthesis may have taken place.},

Abstract = {The ribonucleoprotein components of the nucleus of chick embryo muscle
   cells in different stages of development were studied by electron
   microscopic quantitative stereology. The changes of the constituents
   were related with the appearance of the innervation by means of silver
   impregnation for light microscope. The numerical density of the
   perichromatin granules (PCG) is low in mononuclear cells and myotubes.
   It is noteworthy that the frequency of the PCG does not change during
   the transition of the cells in mitotic cycle to postmitotic myoblasts
   and during myofibril differentiation. However, there is an important
   increment in this parameter when the motor nerve fibers arrive at the
   muscle and the synaptic contacts are established. This change is
   correlated with appearance, or at least with a great increase, of the
   importance of posttranscriptional controls of the expression of some
   genes. The augmentation in the frequency of PCG is not accompanied by
   alterations of the abundance of total RNP particles, in close
   resemblance with the phenomena occurring in neuroblast during the
   differentiation of synaptic endings. The variations of the nucleolar
   volume coincide with the changes in rRNA synthesis.},

Abstract = {Collagenase, collagenolytic activity and tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinases were evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage from 25
   patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and four control subjects. 
   Patients were followed between two and three years, after which they
   were classified as ``healed,{''} ``improved,{''} or ``worsened.{''}  In
   control samples, immunoreactive collagenase was not detected.  The
   enzyme was present in four of seven patients who healed, six of ten
   patients who improved, and four of eight patients who worsened.  There
   was no relationship between the presence or absence of BAL collagenase
   or its concentration and the evolution of the disease.  Latent
   collagenolytic activity was detected only in 5 of the 14 patients who
   displayed immunoreactive collagenase.  Regarding collagenase inhibitor,
   TIMP was present in BAL fluid from all patients and normal subjects. 
   Although the highest values were found in two cases who healed or
   improved, there was not a statistically significant difference among the
   three groups of patients, neither between patients nor control subjects.
   These findings suggest that at least in HP, the presence of collagenase,
   collagenolytic activity, or TIMP in BAL fluid is not associated with the
   prognosis of the disease.},

Abstract = {A microscopic model of an amphotericin B channel is proposed.  The
   structure of the pores is generated using the atomic coordinates of the
   molecule in the structure determined experimentally by X-ray
   diffraction.  The net charges of the atoms are determined by Mulliken
   analysis.  With these charges the electrostatic energy profiles are
   calculated for a monovalent ion passing through the channels formed by
   different number of antibiotic molecules having different radii.  The
   water inside the channel was considered through a continuum medium using
   the dielectric constant of the bulk, and the membrane contribution was
   included using the virtual images of the pore in a dielectric slab of
   epsilon = 3.  The model satisfactorily explains the permeability and
   selectivity characteristics as well as other observations yet
   unexplained.  The electrostatic profiles obtained reinforce the
   hypothesis of the existence of channels formed by a variable number of
   units.},

Abstract = {The oviduct of the lizard, Ctenosaura pectinata was examined prior to
   ovulation and during the period of oviductal transport and shelling of
   eggs. The oviduct was divided into four regions: infundibulum, tube,
   uterus and vagina. The differences noted in the four regions included:
   a) columnar ciliated cells were more abundant in the infundibulum and
   vagina; b) epithelial cells were taller in the uterus and vagina; c)
   glands were more abundant in the uterus; and d) smooth muscle layers
   were thicker in the vagina. These features were similar throughout the
   reproductive cycle, including during gravidity. The histological
   characteristics of the oviducts during gravidity included; a) a wider
   lumen and highly folded mucosa; b) an oviductal wall that became thicker
   due to an increase in myometrial thickness (primarily in the uterus and
   vagina); c) cilia of the epithelial cells that were longer (mainly in
   the infundibulum); d) secretory epithelial cells that increased in
   number and were more active; e) oviductal mast cells that decreased in
   number and degranulate; and f) connective tissue that was more lax and
   abundant throughout the oviduct.},

Title = {Response of Cordia megalantha Blake seedlings to gap environments
   in tropical rain forest},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1988},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-390},
Abstract = {Growth, morphology and leaf dynamics of seedlings of a shade tolerant
   rain forest tree species were analysed in relation to environmental
   heterogeneity associated with gap dynamics of the forest. Seedlings of
   Cordia megalantha Blake were grown in three different environments: in
   the forest understorey below a closed canopy, inside a small canopy gap
   and inside a large gap. Growth and morphology were measured by five
   destructive harvests covering one year of growth. Production and loss of
   leaves was measured in seven repeated censuses covering the same time
   span. RGR(W) was small but significant in the forest understorey (2.6 x
   10(-3) g g(-1) day(-1)), it increased in the small gap (6.9 x 10(-3) g
   g(-1) day(-1)) and was maximal in the large gap (11.0 x 10(-3) g g(-1)
   day(-1)). RGR(a) was maximal in the small gap (6.4 x 10(-3) m(2) m(-2)
   day(-1)), as a result of the high net leaf gain in that environment.
   Plants in the large gap had a higher root weight ratio, a lower leaf
   weight ratio and a higher specific leaf weight than plants growing in
   either forest or small gap. Cordia was found to acclimate rapidly to
   changes in the environment, although not all plant characteristics
   changed at the same rate. Effects of the previous environment on plant
   characteristics could still be detected 6 months after a change in
   environment. It is concluded that gaps in the forest canopy are probably
   necessary for successful regeneration of Cordia megalantha.},

   Short time trypsin incubations and treatment of enzyme preparations with
   4-APMA failed to reveal latent enzyme activity. Metallopeptidases
   specific for gelatin paralleled the presence of collagenase in the media
   of stimulated cells. Raw medium was fractionated by affinity 
   chromatography with heparin-sepharose, collgenase activity bound to
   heparin sepharose while a gelatinase with an apparent molecular weight
   of 54,800 did not. When macrophages were grown in vitro in the presence
   of albumin, the gelatinase activity showed affinity for heparin and an
   apparent molecule weight of 113,000.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The entomological fauna associated with Tillandsia in the Derrame
   Volcanico del Chichinautzin {[}Mexico] belongs to 12 different orders:
   Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Dermaptera, Dictyoptera, Heteroptera,
   Homoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, Psocoptera, Lepidoptera and
   Thysanoptera. The more important families, for their number of role as
   indicators of seasonal variation, were: Pentatomidae, Lygaeidae,
   Chrysomelidae, Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Reduviidae and Vespidae, of
   these, monthly density variation graphs are presented. The changes in
   density and composition of the entomological fauna, correlated with the
   enviromental conditions, led to the conclusion that the tilandsias are
   only a refuge or shelter and to refute the hypothesis that epiphytic
   bromeliads and associated fauna are a true ecosystem.},

   DISPOSITION DURING NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION AND MATURATION},
Journal = {BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},
Year = {1983},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Morphological and quantitative changes of ribonucleoproteic (RNP)
   structures and chromatin are studied in the nuclei of undifferentiated
   {[}chick] cells, neuroblasts and neurons in several degrees of
   maturation, in order to relate them to the drastic modifications in
   transcription and/or RNA processing taking place during cell
   differentiation. Undifferentiated (matrix) cells of 2-day embryos differ
   from that of 4-day embryos in their nucleolar volume and in the amount
   of compact chromatin.  These differences are interpreted as the earliest
   signs of neuroblast differentiation. All over the process of matrix
   cell-bipolar-multipolar neuroblast differentiation there is a large
   spreading of compact chromatin well before any important change in RNP
   structures or in nuclear volume. The most remarkable increase in nuclear
   volume and in the amount of RNP particles occurs during the
   differentiation of multipolar neuroblasts to immature neurons, which is
   characterized by large synaptogenic  activity. The interpretation of
   these changes is discussed in connection, on one hand with the metabolic
   effects of synapses, and on the other hand with the variations of gene
   expression taking place in cell differentiatio and under other natural
   and experimental situations.},

Abstract = {Reticulocytes {[}rabbit] incubated in an isotonic NaCl saline medium
   containing glucose, glutamine and amino acids, were able to detach both
   Fe atoms from all the transferrin incorporated by them. In the absence
   of these metabolites, although transferrin uptake was the same, the
   reticulocytes failed to remove completely the Fe from the transferrin
   which they incorporated. It was previously shown that there is
   unspecific as well as specific binding of transferrin to the
   reticulocyte. By incubating the cells in the presence of a high
   concentration of bovine serum albumin, the unspecific attachment of
   transferrin could be prevented. At least 94\% of the iodinated
   transferrin was capable of donating its Fe to the reticulocytes.},

Title = {Socioeconomic and ecological drivers of snakebite incidence in Mexico: A
   spatial analysis of risk factors},

Abstract = {Background Snakebite envenoming constitutes a significant public health
   challenge in tropical and subtropical regions, with Mexico reporting
   substantial incidence rates in the Americas. While previous
   investigations have documented the socioeconomic burden of snakebites,
   particularly in economically marginalized regions, a comprehensive
   understanding of the relative contributions of biological and
   socioeconomic determinants to spatial heterogeneity in snakebite
   incidence remains poorly understood. This study aimed to identify and
   quantify the main determinants of snakebite spatial heterogeneity across
   Mexico while accounting for potential reporting biases in surveillance
   data.Methods/principal findings We implemented a rigorous Bayesian
   analytical framework utilizing a conditional autoregressive
   zero-inflated Poisson model to examine snakebite incidence across 2,463
   Mexican municipalities. Our methodological approach integrated three
   critical components: environmental suitability indices for venomous
   snake species derived from refined species distribution models,
   socioeconomic vulnerability metrics, and healthcare accessibility
   parameters. Social lag index (beta = 0.308, 95\% CI: 0.106-0.522), road
   network density (beta = 0.376, 95\% CI: 0.215-0.539), and environmental
   suitability for Bothrops asper (beta = 0.268, 95\% CI: 0.047-0.504)
   emerged as the primary factors explaining spatial variation in snakebite
   incidence. Healthcare facility distribution (beta = 0.225, 95\% CI:
   0.126-0.326) was identified as a significant source of reporting bias.
   After controlling for this bias, our model revealed substantially
   different spatial pattern of risk, with elevated predicted incidence in
   urban centers and specific coastal regions not previously identified as
   high-risk areas.Methods/principal findings We implemented a rigorous

   venomous snake species. The identification of systematic reporting
   biases offers critical insights for optimizing surveillance protocols
   and implementing targeted interventions in high-risk municipalities.},

Abstract = {Background The infection caused by the dengue fever virus is a severe
   threat to public health on a global scale; nevertheless, there is
   currently no effective medical treatment or vaccine available to prevent
   or treat the condition.Objective To better understand the
   physicochemical regularities of these proteins, it is necessary to carry
   out a computational multiparametric study of the amino acid sequences of
   envelope proteins expressed by the dengue fever virus and obtain a
   bioinformatics method that can use the subsequences of the training
   protein group to figure out the preponderant function of a protein, up
   to its \textbackslash{}nsequence.Methods Essentially, at the amino acid
   level, various computational programs were applied to the sequences
   expressing the dengue virus envelope glycoproteins to determine the PIM
   2.0 v profile and the Protein Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition (PIDP)
   profile of each protein, and then, at the nucleotide level, a set of
   programs for genomic analysis was applied. Finally, these results were
   contrasted with statistical tests.Results The re-creation of structural
   morphological similarities provided by specific regularities in the PIM
   2.0 v profile and PIDP of the proteins from diverse dengue fever virus
   envelopes made it possible to propose a computer method that employs the
   PIM 2.0 v profile to identify this group of proteins based on their
   sequences; based on our findings, this method is a ``fingerprint{''} of
   this protein group.Conclusion The typical PIM 2.0 v profiles of the
   dengue fever virus proteins might be reproduced by computational tools.
   This knowledge will be helpful in gaining a better understanding of the
   newly discovered virus. Moreover, the method introduced here can
   identify, from the sequence, the predominant function of the protein.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are a key biotic component as primary producers in
   biocrusts, topsoil communities that have important roles in the
   functioning of drylands. Yet, major knowledge gaps exist regarding the
   composition of biocrust cyanobacterial diversity and distribution in
   Mediterranean ecosystems. We describe cyanobacterial diversity in
   Mediterranean semiarid soil crusts along an aridity gradient by using
   next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, and detect clear
   shifts along it in cyanobacterial dominance. Statistical analyses show
   that temperature and precipitation were major parameters determining
   cyanobacterial composition, suggesting the presence of differentiated
   climatic niches for distinct cyanobacteria. The responses to temperature
   of a set of cultivated, pedigreed strains representative of the field
   populations lend direct support to that contention, with psychrotolerant
   vs thermotolerant physiology being strain dependent, and consistent with
   their dominance along the natural gradient. Our results suggest a
   possible replacement, as global warming proceeds, of cool-adapted by
   warm-adapted nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (such as Scytonema) and a
   switch in the dominance of Microcoleus vaginatus by thermotolerant,
   novel phylotypes of bundle-forming cyanobacteria. These differential
   sensitivities of cyanobacteria to rising temperatures and decreasing
   precipitation, their ubiquity, and their low generation time point to
   their potential as bioindicators of global change.},

Title = {Effects of maternal diet on reproductive performance of O.

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of mixed diets (with the crab
   Callinectes spp. as the main component of the diet) on embryonic
   development and hatchling quality of Octopus maya. Several O. maya
   females were fed one of 4 different diets being 1) crab, 2) crab and
   squid, 3) crab and mussel and 4) crab and fish heads, in a 7: 3 ratio.
   The effects of each diet on the reproductive performance were evaluated
   by quantifying the total number of eggs female(-1), eggs clutch(-1),
   hatchlings female(-1), hatchling weight and hatchling quality, measured
   as the hatchling survival after 10 days of fasting. In addition, the
   chemical characteristics of the diet were studied through determination
   of proximal analysis, amino acid and fatty acid profiles, its relation
   to the chemical characteristics of the yolk and the morphological
   characteristics of embryos. Results indicate that mixed diets delivered
   embryos with a combination of nutrients that promoted a better
   performance, compared to those from females fed crab exclusively.
   Females fed mixed diets apparently used energetic amino acids (AAs) to
   synthesize yolk, which play essential roles in embryo metabolism. In
   addition, females fed mixed diets used saturated and polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (FAs) in the diet to provide yolk with a combination of FAs
   that allowed hatchlings a better performance during the first days of
   culture. Mixed diets used in the present study could have the
   nutritional components to satisfy nutritional requirements for
   reproduction in this octopus species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Nowadays, magnetic resonance (MR) in Mexico has become a standard
   technique for clinical imaging. Although most of the times the MR
   systems contain only coils oriented for adults. Radiologists use these
   coils for children studies due to the non-availability of pediatric
   coils. Image quality is decreased due to the low signal to noise ratio
   delivered to the system. The development of RF coils is always focused
   towards increasing SNR and optimizing the RF penetration into the
   sample. Moreover, spinal pathologies in children, which are an important
   topic in pediatric care, cover congenital and neuromuscular disorders
   that occur in childhood. In this work, the design of a dedicated
   six-channel coil for detection of spinal pathologies at 1.5 Tesla is
   addressed. Numerical electromagnetic simulations were performed in order
   to evaluate their magnetic field performance at (63.6 MHz) 1.5 Tesla.
   The magnetic field uniformity as well as the RF penetration depth of the
   coil configurations was evaluated in order to find the best/optimized
   coil array configuration. The coil is comprised of three rows, one with
   4 coil elements and two with only one coil element. Phantom and in vivo
   images were acquired with the six-channel pediatric coil array. The
   phantom images agree with the simulated data. In vivo images acquired
   with the 6-channel pediatric coil array have shown very good penetration
   depth and homogeneity, which allow better image quality throughout the
   whole FOV. In addition, the parallel imaging capabilities of the array
   allow the acceleration of the experiments avoiding possible motion
   artifacts.},

Abstract = {The Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM) is used to compute the
   seismic response of a three-dimensional rockfill dam model. The IBEM is
   based on a single layer integral representation of elastic fields in
   terms of the full-space Green function, or fundamental solution of the
   equations of dynamic elasticity, and the associated force densities
   along the boundaries. The method has been applied to simulate the ground
   motion in several configurations of surface geology. Moreover, the IBEM
   has been used as benchmark to test other procedures. We compute the
   seismic response of a three-dimensional rockfill dam model placed within
   a canyon that constitutes an irregularity on the surface of an elastic
   half-space. The rockfill is also assumed elastic with hysteretic damping
   to account for energy dissipation. Various types of incident waves are
   considered to analyze the physical characteristics of the response:
   symmetries, amplifications, impulse response and the like. Computations
   are performed in the frequency domain and lead to time response using
   Fourier analysis. In the present implementation a symmetrical model is
   used to test symmetries. The boundaries of each region are discretized
   into boundary elements whose size depends on the shortest wavelength,
   typically, six boundary segments per wavelength. Usually, the seismic
   response of rockfill dams is simulated using either finite elements
   (FEM) or finite differences (FDM). In most applications, commercial
   tools that combine features of these methods are used to assess the
   seismic response of the system for a given motion at the base of model.
   However, in order to consider realistic excitation of seismic waves with
   different incidence angles and azimuth we explore the IBEM.},

Abstract = {The biomisation method is used to reconstruct Latin American vegetation
   at 6000 +/- 500 and 18 000 +/- 1000 radiocarbon years before present
   (C-14 yr BP) from pollen data. Tests using modern pollen data from 381
   samples derived from 287 locations broadly reproduce potential natural
   vegetation. The strong temperature gradient associated with the Andes is
   recorded by a transition from high altitude cool grass/shrubland and
   cool mixed forest to mid-altitude cool temperate rain forest, to
   tropical dry, seasonal and rain forest at low altitudes. Reconstructed
   biomes from a number of sites do not match the potential vegetation due
   to local factors such as human impact, methodological artefacts and
   mechanisms of pollen representivity of the parent vegetation.
   At 6000 +/- 500 C-14 yr BP 255 samples are analysed from 127 sites.
   Differences between the modern and the 6000 +/- 500 C-14 yr BP
   reconstruction are comparatively small; change relative to the modern
   reconstruction are mainly to biomes characteristic of drier climate in
   the north of the region with a slight more mesic shift in the south.
   Cool temperate rain forest remains dominant in western South America. In
   northwestern South America a number of sites record transitions from
   tropical seasonal forest to tropical dry forest and tropical rain forest
   to tropical seasonal forest. Sites in Central America show a change in
   biome assignment, but to more mesic vegetation, indicative of greater
   plant available moisture, e.g. on the Yucatan peninsula sites record
   warm evergreen forest, replacing tropical dry forest and warm mixed
   forest presently recorded.
   At 18 000 +/- 1000 C-14 yr BP 61 samples from 34 sites record vegetation
   reflecting a generally cool and dry environment. Cool grass/shrubland is
   prevalent in southeast Brazil whereas Amazonian sites record tropical
   dry forest, warm temperate rain forest and tropical seasonal forest.
   Southernmost South America is dominated by cool grass/shrubland, a
   single site retains cool temperate rain forest indicating that forest
   was present at some locations at the LGM. Some sites in Central Mexico
   and lowland Colombia remain unchanged in the biome assignments of warm
   mixed forest and tropical dry forest respectively, although the
   affinities that these sites have to different biomes do change between
   18 000 +/- 1000 C-14 yr BP and present. The `unresponsive' nature of
   these sites results from their location and the impact of local edaphic
   influence.},

Journal = {NUCLEAR PHYSICS A},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {A number of tests are introduced which probe the ability of nuclear mass
   models to extrapolate. Three models are analyzed in detail: the liquid
   drop model, the liquid drop model plus empirical shell corrections and
   the Duflo-Zuker mass formula. If predicted nuclei are close to the
   fitted ones, average errors in predicted and fitted masses are similar.
   However, the challenge of predicting nuclear masses in a region
   stabilized by shell effects (e.g., the lead region) is far more
   difficult. The Duflo-Zuker mass formula emerges as a powerful predictive
   tool. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {This article seeks to show bow several rhetorical tools were used and,
   in fact, played a central role in the argumentation advanced by Niles
   Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in their 1972 seminal article on the
   theory of Punctuated Equilibria. It is analyzed how Eldredge and Gould
   proceeded through three steps that, sequentially integrated, made their
   argument compelling. It is shown how they made use of analogies,
   metaphors and other rhetorical tools. It is sustained that they began by
   priming the reader to distrust the current interpretation of the fossil
   record offered by most paleontologists and then, in a second step, they
   used specific visual representations in order to suggest that the
   competitor theory was committed to the idea of an even and slow
   evolution at a constant rate, an image utilized by them as straw man.
   Finally, it is analyzed how, in their third step, Eldredge and Gould
   made use of several rhetorical arguments to present their theory as new
   for paleontology while, at the same time, placing it well inside the
   frame of the modern synthesis, and how they also managed to present
   their theory as more promising and capable of making predictions for
   future researches than the competitor theory.},

Abstract = {Learning how to count in different bases has been seen as a trivial task
   in almost all introductory 7 mathematics courses. However the low
   performance shown by many students, while performing this task, is
   appalling. This situation has motivated serious research in this matter
   In order to study a model of count learning, we analyze the performance
   of a multilayer perceptron that learns to count in several bases (5, 10,
   13, 20, 60). We give evidence that it is not equivalent for the model to
   learn to count in all base as the errors are not equivalent, biased
   toward a low error when the task is to learn to count in base 20. When
   the task is to learn to count in all bases following a given sequence,
   the model shows non-equivalent errors for some bases. This may sized
   some light on education planning that can result in better introductory
   courses.},

Abstract = {Present classification systems for buried paleosols are inadequately
   developed. Several classification systems for paleosols, based on the US
   Soil Taxonomy, have been developed recently, but their use is still very
   limited. We propose appilcation of the World Reference Base for Soil
   Resources, which uses only substantial profile characteristics, as a
   background for the development of a new buried paleosol classification.
   The system was adapted for the use for buried paleosols. Dynamic
   criteria, which could be altered by diagenesis, were disregarded, and
   the definitions of most horizons were modified. A new prefix
   ``infra-{''} was applied for modified diagnostic horizons and
   properties, and for refernce groups of buried paleosols. As a result, 11
   diagnostic horizons, 2 properties and 2 materials were left with their
   definitions and names; 9 diagnostic horizons and 2 properties were
   modified, and named with the prefix ``infra{''}; 14 diagnostic horizons,
   6 properties and 4 materials were excluded or joined with others; and
   two new diagnostic horizons were proposed. This relationship reflects
   the balance between stable and dynamic properties in the diagnostic
   criteria used by the WRB. The number of soil units proposed for buried
   paleosols is fewer, than for surface soils in the WRB (25 instead of
   30). The use of WRB modifiers, reflecting dynamic soil properties, was
   tentatively recommended for the second-level buried paleosols
   classification with prefixes ``pedo-{''} for pedogenically derived
   properties, and ``dia-{''} for the properties caused by post-burial
   processes. The application of the proposed system to a set of paleosols,
   previously described in the literature, showed its utility for buried
   paleosol classification. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Title = {Classical and quantum phase transitions in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
   model},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {74},
Number = {10},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An analysis of the classical and quantum phase transitions of the
   Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is presented. It is shown that the classical
   dynamics is ruled by the energy surface of the system. Applying the
   catastrophe formalism to this energy surface the separatrix is obtained.
   It determines the regions in the control parameter space where there are
   phase transitions. Special attention is given to the compositions of
   ground and first-excited energy states, which are well described by the
   even and odd SU(2) coherent states. Phase transitions are shown to be
   associated with a change in the wave functions from collective to
   single-particle behavior. Evaluating the distribution of
   nearest-neighbor spacings it is shown that the separatrix of the system
   emerges as a useful tool to describe the global behavior of the
   quantum-level structure and their corresponding wave functions.},

Title = {Relation between reproductive, physiological, and immunological
   condition of Litopenaeus setiferus pre-adult males fed different
   dietary protein levels (Crustacea; Penaeidae)},
Journal = {ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {92},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of amount of
   dietary protein levels on blood indicators of protein metabolism and
   immune condition (blood protein, hemocyanin, osmotic pressure, and
   hemocytes concentrations), and reproductive capacity of pre-adult
   Litopenaeus setiferus males (F-0). Assessments were made of the
   relationship between amount of dietary protein, immune condition, and
   reproductive condition of the shrimp during the maturation process.
   Three different diets, with different amounts of protein (DP; 35, 45,
   and 55\%), were evaluated over 55 days and compared with shrimp that
   were from a baseline group before treatments were administrated. Osmotic
   pressure, hemocyanin, blood protein, and hemocytes were greater in
   shrimp from control ponds than those obtained of shrimp fed 35 and 45\%
   DP and similar to that obtained in shrimp fed 55\% DP, demonstrating
   that food in the control pond had a nutritional value to that obtained
   by feeding amounts of dietary protein beyond 45\%. Osmotic pressure,
   hemocyanin (Hc), blood protein (BP), and hemocytes were influenced by
   amount of DP with the physiology and immune system of shrimp being
   influenced by diet. At the same time, a maximum reproductive condition
   (measured as a proportion of normal cells of the total sperm cells) of
   shrimp males was observed in shrimp fed 45\% DPL with lesser normal
   cells being present in shrimp fed 35 and 55\% DPL. These results
   indicate that an immune reaction can occur in response to dietary
   protein with excess DP affecting several physiological functions
   included the sperm synthesis and sperm quality. Influence on hemocytes
   concentration in shrimp fed protein in excess could activate an attack
   on sperm cells in the vas deferens provoking lose of sperm quality in
   such conditions. Results indicate an optimal DP of 45 for maintaining
   the broodstock bank of L. setiferus. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Declines of amphibian populations have been well documented in the US,
   Canada, and Central America, but little is known regarding the status of
   amphibian populations in Mexico. In 2000, we surveyed 43 transects from
   3 upland regions in Guerrero and Oaxaca, Mexico. We found 161 adult
   amphibians belonging to 39 species, representing only 19-48\% of the
   anuran fauna known from these regions. We found one dead
   (Eleutherodactylus saltator) and one dying frog (Ptychohyla erythromma)
   from two different streams near Chilpancingo, Guerrero. Both frogs were
   infected with Batrachochytridium dendrobatidis, a pathogenic fungus
   involved in other declines of amphibian populations. We collected 368
   tadpoles; 60 (19\%) tadpoles from 9 different streams among the three
   regions were missing mouthparts, which is indicative of infection by
   chytrid fungus. We report additional data from the state of Chiapas,
   Mexico, that document declines, disease, and apparent extirpations from
   that region as well. Overall, we report 31 populations (representing 24
   species) that appear to have been extirpated, including populations of
   as many as I I endemic species that have been missing for 16-40 years
   and may be extinct. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
